 This review found 38 studies involving 7843 children. The children and their parents were more likely to be admitted to the emergency department if they received asthma education. There was no difference in the number of unscheduled doctor visits or other outcomes. There was no statistically significant difference between education and control. There is uncertainty as to the long-term effect of education on other markers of asthma morbidity such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function. It remains unclear as

 This review included 47 randomised trials involving 3639 participants. The trials were conducted and published in China. Thirty-eight different herbal medicines were tested in these trials, including four single herbs (extracts from a single herb), eight traditional Chinese patent medicines, and 26 self concocted Chinese herbal compound prescriptions. The trials reported on global symptom improvement (including improvement in numbness or pain) and changes in nerve conduction velocity. The
 This review included five randomized controlled trials involving 1382 patients. All the studies involved advanced prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study (77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in progression of prostate cancer in the IAS group for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. For patients with
 We found 12 studies that compared the use of an IUD immediately after abortion with the use of a delayed insertion. Five studies randomised women to either immediate or delayed insertion of an IUD. One study randomised women to either immediate versus delayed insertion of the Copper 7 or the Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or CuT380A. One study randomised women to the Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of meditation practice with usual care in patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia.

Ninety-one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the study throughout the six-month follow-up period and were
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared varicella vaccine given within three days to children following household contact with a varicella case. We found three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella
 We included 12 randomised controlled trials, with 4704 participants, in this review. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different antibiotic regimens. The trials were at high risk of bias. With the exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery; nor does it appear that there was high
 We included two randomised controlled trials (involving 116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM. The number of women included in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes. Investigators used strict inclusion criteria and in both studies relatively few of the women presenting with PPROM were eligible for inclusion. There was no evidence of differences between groups for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnion
 The review of trials found that staples are associated with similar wound infections, pain and cosmesis compared with sutures, and these two methods are the most commonly studied methods for skin closure after caesarean section. If staples are removed on day three, there is an increased incidence of skin separation and the need for reclosure compared with absorbable sutures.
 We searched for studies that compared the effects of green tea and black tea on cardiovascular events. We found 11 studies with a total of 821 participants.

The trials were conducted in different countries and were conducted in different countries. The trials were conducted in different countries and were conducted
 We searched for studies up to May 2015 and found 15 studies that included 1835 cancer patients. Most studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials) or prostate cancer patients (two trials). Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual and low quality evidence that there is
 We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women in this update of the review. The trials were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interest. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged.
 We included 32 studies in this review. Seventeen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230). It was not possible to pool any of the data because each study compared different culture media. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Four of these studies found no evidence of a difference between the media compared, for either day three or day five embryo transfer. The
 The review authors searched for relevant articles in the literature and found 2847 citations overall. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomis

We found 67 randomised clinical trials involving a total of 6197 participants. All the trials were at high risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2014. We found no evidence of differences in most of the comparisons, and where there was, these differences were in single trials, mostly of small sample size. We summaris
 This review found that there is evidence that a combination of retinoids and retinoids is better than the individual treatments. The use of topical steroid under hydrocolloid occlusion is beneficial. It would also appear that low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful in treating PPP. Colchicine has a lot of side effects and it is unclear if it is effective and

Various intraperi
 We searched for studies that compared the sensitivity and specificity of the tests with microscopy. We found 74 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens. Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) either by itself or with other antigens. We found that HRP-2 antibody types were more
 We searched for studies that compared the length of consultations for primary care physicians with the length of consultations for other health-related issues. We found five studies that met our inclusion criteria. All were conducted in the UK, and tested short-term changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient. We are uncertain whether altering the length of consultation increases primary care consultation length, number of referrals and investigations, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction based on very low-certainty
 The review authors searched for studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of high dose versus low dose stavudine in ART naive patients with high viral loads.

 This review included 29 trials, which enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. The risk of complications was reduced with plastic stents, but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stents. One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better
 We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants. Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. The evidence is current to May 2014. We found moderate-quality evidence suggesting that ultrasound guidance for radial artery cannulation improves first and second attempt success rates and decreases the rate of complications as compared with palpation
 We included one small study (80 male student participants conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009) and three studies (general population studies in Canadian provinces conducted in the 1970s and 80s). The studies evaluated the effect of a ban on alcohol consumption in the general population. The studies evaluated different types of bans (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period. The results from the three studies were inconsistent. The results from the two

 We included 12 randomised controlled trials enrolling 3474 patients. The overall risk of bias was unclear for the majority of articles due to a lack of reported data; however, the authors determined that this would be unlikely to impact negatively as most data outcomes were objective (e.g. death vs. no death). There was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non-complex lesions. In complex lesions, there were no statistically
 This review found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 333 participants. The trials were conducted in Italy and included children under 24 months of age. The trials used nebulised salbutamol, steroids, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids or tube feeding, nasal washing, nasal decongestants and antibiotics.

 We found seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals amongst whom 118 cross-over participants also served as their own controls. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (N = 322 including cross-over controls). The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a
 We searched for studies that compared combined strength and aerobic exercise training versus usual care in people with SMA type 3. We found one study that compared combined strength and aerobic exercise training versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA type 3. The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study was conducted in the United States,
 Two small trials (N = 149) were included. In both trials, allocation concealment was inadequate and arrangements for blinding of outcome assessment were unclear. One trial (81 patients with cervical radiculopathy) found that surgical decompression was superior to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in the short-term for pain, weakness or sensory loss; at one year, there were no significant differences between groups. One trial (68 patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical my
 We included nine studies in this review. Six studies compared telephone consultation versus normal care; four by a doctor, one by a nurse and one by a clinic clerk. Three studies compared telephone consultation by different types of health care workers; two compared nurses with doctors and one compared health assistants with doctors or nurses. Three of five studies found a decrease in visits to GP's but two found a significant increase in return consultations. In general
 We searched for studies that compared MI with other interventions, such as a control group or a control group, to prevent alcohol use, misuse or alcohol-related problems. We found 84 studies with 22,872 participants. The studies were of moderate or low quality. We found that MI interventions reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed, frequency of alcohol consumption, and peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in people who were at high risk of alcohol misuse. We found no effect on bin
 We included 29 studies with a total of 2210 people with asthma. All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of bias (i.e. the studies were not blinded). We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD, computer app or game) and technique
 Three small trials, involving 226 participants, were included in this review. One trial included patients with presumed ischaemic stroke without computerised tomography (CT) verification, and the other two trials included patients with CT-verified ICH. Death and dependency could be calculated in the larger ICH trial without differences between the mannitol and control groups. Death and disability could be calculated in the larger ICH trial without differences between the mannito
 This review found that D-penicillamine may be effective in reducing the disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It appears to be similar to that of other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but with a significantly higher toxicity. Its effects on long-term functional status and radiological progression are not clear from this review.
 We searched for studies that compared decoctions of Huangqi compounds with other Chinese herbs. We found four relevant studies. All of the studies used a decoction containing Huangqi compounds as the intervention with chemotherapy. The intervention groups of three studies were compared to a chemotherapy alone control group, the fourth study compared the decoction of Huangqi compounds with two other Chinese herbal interventions. None of the studies reported on primary outcome using Common Toxi
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared vitamin A and/or DHA with placebo or no treatment. We included three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.

 The review authors found that the use of prophylactic vancomycin in low doses reduces the incidence of nosocomial sepsis in the newborn infant. However, the methods of these studies may have contributed to the low rate of sepsis in the treated groups, as the blood cultures drawn from central lines may have failed to grow due to the low levels of vancomycin in the infusate. The review authors conclude that routine prophyl
 We found 13 randomised controlled trials on dressings or topical agents for postoperative wounds healing by secondary intention. The evidence is current to January 2014. We found only small, poor quality trials; the evidence is therefore insufficient to determine whether the choice of dressing or topical agent affects the healing of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. Foam is best studied as an alternative for gauze and appears to be preferable as to pain reduction, patient satisfaction and nursing time.
 We searched for studies up to January 2014. We included seven studies with 1482 women. Four studies examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).

 We included nine studies, randomising 519 participants, comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum. Three studies randomised participants to nitrous oxide (three trials), helium (five trials), or room air (one trial) was compared to carbon dioxide. The evidence is current to May 2014. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide on cardiopulmonary complications, or surgical morbidity. There were no serious
 We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness of different doses of dexamethasone in preterm infants. We found 14 studies that compared different doses of dexamethasone in preterm infants. Eight studies enrolling 303 infants investigated the cumulative dose administered; three studies contrasted a high versus a moderate and five studies a moderate versus a low cumulative dose. The combined outcomes of death or BPD and
 The review included eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people. The trials compared several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus aspirin, placebo or no treatment. Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2001. Overall there were
 We included six studies with a total of 12,294 participants from 79 communities. Two studies that assessed insecticide spray as a fly control measure found that trachoma is reduced by at least 55% to 61% with this measure compared to no intervention. However, another study did not find insecticide spray to be effective in reducing trachoma. One study found that another fly control measure, latrine provision, reduced trachoma by 29.

 We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness of different treatments for children with CAS. We found one study that compared the two treatments: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3) and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). The study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause. The study was funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lo
 We searched for studies that compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment. We found four studies that compared antibiotics with either no treatment or a placebo. One study in Brazil in both adults and children compared trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol over 20 months to no treatment and was judged to be at high risk of bias. The other three studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo. Only the study in Brazil of trimethoprim-
 We included 43 trials involving predominantly older people with mainly trochanteric fractures. Twenty-two trials (3749 participants) compared the Gamma nail with the sliding hip screw (SHS). The Gamma nail was associated with increased risk of operative and later fracture of the femur and increased reoperation rate. There were no major differences between implants in wound infection, mortality or medical complications. Five trials (623 participants) compared the intra
 We searched for studies that compared surgical management with medical management for bowel obstruction in ovarian cancer. We found only low quality evidence that compared surgical management with medical management for bowel obstruction in ovarian cancer. Therefore we are unable to reach definite conclusions about the relative benefits and harms of the two forms of treatment, or to identify sub-groups of women who are likely to benefit from one treatment or the other. However, there is weak evidence in support
 The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared statins with placebo or no treatment. They included a total of 244 women with PCOS receiving 12 weeks or 6 weeks of treatment. Two trials (184 women randomised) studied the effects of simvastatin and two trials (60 women randomised) studied the effects of atorvastatin. There was no good evidence that statins improved menstrual regularity,
 This review identified no new studies. We found no evidence from controlled trials to support or refute the use of any of the proposed interventions compared with radiotherapy. Therefore, the choice of intervention will be based on local resources. Radiotherapy techniques for managing vaginal bleeding are not readily available in resource-poor settings, where advanced cases of cervical cancer are predominant. Thus, this systematic review identified the need for a randomised controlled trial assessing the benefits and risks of pal
 The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared temozolomide with radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The authors found three RCTs enrolling a total of 745 patients that investigated temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The results showed that temozolomide increased
 We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness of these interventions in different settings. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study conducted in Cambodia found that contracting-in may improve health care access and utilization and that intermittent training courses over 18 months may improve district health system managers’ performance. However, contracting-in was not found to have an effect on population health outcomes. The other study found that intermittent training courses over 18 months may improve district health system managers’ performance.

 Three randomised controlled trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated interventions for hyperkalaemia. Urine output was ascertained in only one study (Hu 1999). In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. One study (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to rectal cation-resin, caused a reduction in all cause
 This review included 12 studies with a total of 623 severely affected participants. The review found that IVIg hastens recovery as much as PE in severe disease. The review found that IVIg started within two weeks from onset hastens recovery as much as PE. Adverse events were not significantly more frequent with either treatment but IVIg is significantly much more likely to be completed than PE. One trial in altogether 51 children showed no significant difference when the standard dose was

 The review included eight randomised controlled trials involving 660 participants. The studies were of poor quality and included only two trials that reported the number of participants who were dead or dependent at the end of 28 days of treatment. The total case fatality rate was lower than 1% indicating that participants probably had mild strokes. Few adverse events were reported. Data were limited in respect of stroke recurrence and quality of life.
 The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the timing of placement of implants and the length of time patients had to wait for the tooth to be filled. Four RCTs were identified but only seven trials could be included. Four RCTs evaluated implant placement timing. Two RCTs compared immediate versus delayed implants in 126 patients and found no statistically significant differences. One RCT compared immediate-delayed versus delayed implants
 We found two trials that compared clioquinol with placebo in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia. One trial compared clioquinol with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog)) between the active treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. The difference in mean change
 We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children. Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class (high-certainty evidence), to walk 48 metres further in 6MWD (high-certainty

The average decrease in growth was -1.54 cm per year. In children with mild-moderate
 This review found that APD does not differ from CAPD in terms of mortality, risk of peritonitis, switching from original PD modality to a different dialysis modality, hernias, PD fluid leaks, catheter removal or hospital admissions. APD may however be considered advantageous in select group of patients such as in the younger PD population and those in employment or education due to its psychosocial advantages. There is a need
 This review found 37 trials (9312 patients) that compared CRT with CRT. The results showed that CRT is better than CRT for most early stage HD patients. For advanced stages (III to IV), CRT better prevents progression/relapse but CT alone seems to cause less SM. RT alone gives a higher overall SM risk than CRT due to increased need for salvage therapy. Reduced SM risk after IF-RT instead of
 We searched for studies that compared opioids with other treatments, such as morphine, steroid, or morphine-containing drugs. We found 26 studies with 27 treatment groups that enrolled 4893 participants. Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trial continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids. Opioids were administered orally (number of study treatments groups [abbreviated as "k"

This trial compared o
 We included six randomised controlled trials involving 8372 people. All trials were judged to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain. Four trials compared email communication to standard mail and two compared email communication to usual care. For the primary health service outcome of uptake of preventive screening, there was no difference between email and standard mail. For both comparisons (email versus standard mail and email versus usual care) there was no difference between the
 This review includes 11 studies involving 855 participants. The addition of postural restrictions to the Epley manoeuvre alone was not associated with any adverse effects. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be

 We searched for studies that compared hCG priming to no priming, or to hCG priming alone. We found four studies, with a total of 522 women, in the review. One of these studies did not report outcomes per woman randomised, and so was not included in formal analysis. Three studies investigated 10,000 units hCG priming compared to no priming. One study investigated 20,000 units hCG compared to 10,000 units h
 This review found 24 trials, but only 16 (10,114 women) had analyseable data. Meta-analyses showed no effect of either ERT or HRT on prevention of cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. It is not known whether either specific types of ERT or HRT have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy in similarly aged women
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found two studies with 880 participants. The studies compared a combination of ICS/LABA (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily) with a combination of LAMA (18 mcg tiotropium; TIO). The studies lasted 12 weeks. Both studies used the same combination of inhaled ICS/LABA (flu
 This review included two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials, with data from four short-term trials (169 participants) available for analysis. The results of these trials suggest that SRIs and CBT may be useful in treating patients with BDD. The findings of these studies need to be replicated. In addition, future controlled studies in other samples, such as adolescents, and using other selective SRIs, as well as a range of psychological therapy approaches and modal

The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The studies were conducted in children and adults. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The studies were
 We searched for studies that compared the effects of hypothermia therapy with other treatments in people with TBI. We included 37 studies with a total of 3110 participants. Most studies commenced treatment immediately on admission to hospital or after craniotomies and all treatment was maintained for at least 24 hours. Thirty-three studies reported data for death, 31 studies reported data for unfavourable outcomes (death, vegetative state or severe disability), and 14
 This review identified three high-quality and three low-quality studies, involving 519 people with depression. The studies were very different in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments. The current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. At this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy
 This review included three trials involving 206 participants, all patients with vascular dementia. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The trials were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospital, clinic, and hospital. The trials were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospital, clinic, hospital, and hospital. The trials were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospital, clinic, hospital, and hospital. The trials were conducted in
 This review found seven randomised controlled trials including 960 participants. The quality of the trials was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment. The evidence is current to January 2014. The results of this review suggest that insertion of a drain following axillary lymphadenectomy reduces the chances of developing a seroma and reduces the number of post-operative seroma aspirations.
 We searched for studies that compared flavonoids with other drugs to prevent colorectal cancer. We found eight studies with 390,769 participants. Five studies used a prospective cohort design, two were case-control studies and one a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The results from the studies assessing associations between flavonoids, colorectal cancer and adenomas were contradictory. There was no evidence that total flavonoids intake
 We included seven randomised controlled trials with 1369 participants. All trials had high risk of bias. Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three other trials (including one that used both definitions) used the second definition. None of the included trials mentioned our primary outcomes. However, regarding the secondary outcomes, extension of the treatment period to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response according to both definitions (71/217 (32.7%) versus 52/194 (26

 We searched for studies that compared treatments for blepharitis with other types of blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics. We found 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) that compared different treatments for blepharitis. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The studies were conducted in different countries, and the treatments were compared with each other. We found no strong evidence for any
 We found one study with a total of 23 participants. The study was at high risk of bias. None of our primary outcomes and only one of our secondary outcomes (reduction in volume of disease, assessed endoscopically) was measured in the study. There was no significant difference between the groups (very low-quality evidence). Adverse effects reported included airway swelling requiring intubation in a child with severe RRP a few hours after photodynamic therapy. There is
 We identified 42 studies with 4220 participants. Twenty studies provided accuracy data based on the number of individual participants (seven of which provided data with and without the use of contrast). Sixteen of these studies evaluated the accuracy of CDUS. These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of the studies, the delay between the tests was unclear or longer than four weeks; in eight (50%), the
 We searched for studies that compared sterile water with saline or saline for low back pain. We found seven studies, with 766 women, that compared sterile water with saline or saline. All women had low back pain in labour only. The studies were small and had poor methodological quality. We found no evidence that sterile water is effective for low back pain. We found no difference in delivery or other
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found 12 studies with a total of 1932 participants. The studies were conducted in Lichtenstein, Germany, USA, Canada, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. The studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands. The studies were conducted
 We found 32 studies addressing technical editing and 66 surveys of reference accuracy. Only three of the studies were randomised controlled trials. A 'package' of largely unspecified editorial processes applied between acceptance and publication was associated with improved readability in two studies and improved reporting quality in another two studies, while another study showed mixed results after stricter editorial policies were introduced. More intensive editorial processes were associated with fewer errors in abstracts and references. Providing instructions to authors
 We searched for studies that compared codeine with placebo or other painkillers. We included 15 studies, including 721 participants with cancer pain due to diverse types of cancer. All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children. The included studies were of adequate methodological quality, but all except one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because of small study size, and six because of methods used to deal with missing data or high withdrawal rates. Twelve
 The review included 12 trials (11 randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial) of 563 people with sickle cell disease aged six to 35 years old. The majority of participants were African-American. The interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and the post-intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. The quality of evidence was low for selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation, allocation conceal
 We searched for studies that compared brivaracetam with placebo or no treatment. We included six studies that compared brivaracetam with other treatments, such as a steroid or a placebo. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The studies were conducted between 1980 and 2012 and included 2411 participants. The studies were of short duration, and included participants between 16 and 80 years of age. The studies were of moderate
 We included 38 studies, mostly from high-income countries, many of which explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication. Some focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence in the evidence). Lack of information led to worry and regret about vaccination decisions among some parents (moderate confidence). Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination benefits and harms (high confidence), presented clearly and
 We searched for studies that compared different psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa. We found 10 studies, with a total of 599 participants, and included them in the review. Seven had been identified in the previous versions of this review and we now include three new trials. We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible, and six ongoing trials are new for this update. Two of the 10 trials included children. Trials tested diverse
 The review included 516 participants from three randomised controlled trials. One trial was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil or sulfur hexafluoride gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades. The third trial was a multi-

 We included six studies (involving 142 participants) in this review. Two compared three-times-a-week prophylaxis with on-demand treatment in children with hemophilia. The number of patients with preserved joints after three to seven years of follow-up was not pooled due to significant heterogeneity. Three of the remaining four studies evaluated hemophilia A; one showed a statistically significant decrease in frequency of joint bleed
 We included one new study in this update. In total, 13 trials involving 1824 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Data in usable format were only available in 10 trials (732 participants). In total, eight studies aimed to induce remission; overall survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Five studies aimed to maintain remission. In two out of three studies reporting survival, this was substantial but the difference was not statistically significant between treatment groups.
 The review included two studies involving 447 women with RhD negative babies. The studies compared IM and IV administration of anti-D prophylaxis. The women received a 1500 IU (300 microgram) dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of gestation. There was no incidence of RhD alloimmunization in either of the studies, as the sample size was insufficient for meaningful comparison of this uncommon outcome. One of the studies
 The review included eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients with diabetes. Three included studies investigated ticlopidine compared to aspirin or placebo. Five included studies investigated clopidogrel compared to aspirin or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, or clopidogrel in combination with aspirin to aspirin alone. All trials included patients with previous CVD except the CHARISMA
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared non-invasive ventilation with other techniques for airway clearance. We included 10 trials with a total of 191 participants.

 We searched for randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin D with placebo or no intervention in people with rheumatoid diseases. We found 56 randomised clinical trials with 95,286 participants. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included
 The review included 22 randomized controlled trials, with a total of 296 participants for fluoxitine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine. The magnitude of weight loss was modest, however, and the long-term health benefits remain unclear. The safety of sibutramine is uncertain. There is a lack of data on other drugs for weight loss or control in persons with type 2 diabetes.
 We searched for studies that compared VGB with CBZ in people with epilepsy. We found five studies involving a total of 734 participants. The studies were of poor quality and were of high risk of bias. We found no significant differences between VGB and CBZ in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation, but results did show a disadvantage for VGB on time to first
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the addition of plerixafor to G-CSF mobilisation and collection of stem cells. We found four RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. Two of these trials closed prematurely due to low recruitment and did not report results. The remaining two trials evaluated 600 participants with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In both studies the experimental group received
 We included 23 trials involving 1806 women, of whom 717 received cones. All of the trials were small, and in many the quality was hard to judge. Outcome measures differed between trials, making the results difficult to combine. Some trials reported high drop-out rates with both cone and comparison treatments. Seven trials were published only as abstracts. The results suggest that weighted vaginal cones are better than no active treatment in women with SUI
 We included 11 trials with a total of 2246 AF patients (ranging from 14 to 712 by study). Studies included education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education interventions. The effect of self-monitoring plus education on TTR was uncertain compared with usual care. We found small but positive effects of education on anxiety and depression (low-quality evidence). The effect of decision aids on decision conflict favoured usual care. The effect of
 This review included 70 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (11,487 women) comparing prostaglandin E2 with no treatment, placebo or no treatment, four different prostaglandin formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) and one trial compares PGF2a with placebo. The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes (a variety of measures) is uncertain. Prostaglandins probably
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared cot-nursing with incubator care. We found five trials, involving 247 infants, that compared cot-nursing with warming of the nursery. The results showed that cot-nursing resulted in no significant difference in body temperature, but the one trial that reported on episodes of hyperthermia found this to be statistically more common in the cot-
 We included three studies, involving 146 participants. The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs. One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group). One study reported on complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate.
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found three studies, involving 244 women. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias. The prostaglandins used were PG E2 analogue (sulprostone) in 50 participants and PG E1 analogue (misoprostol) in 194 participants at a dose of 250 mcg and 800 mcg respectively. The prostaglandin
 We included six studies involving 355 infants - two using face mask CPAP, two CNP, one nasal CPAP and one both CNP and endotracheal CPAP (for sicker babies). The results of these studies suggest that continuous distending pressure (CDP) is associated with lower risk of treatment failure (death or use of assisted ventilation) and lower overall mortality (lower overall mortality) and lower mortality in infants
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found six studies involving 157 participants. The studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times. The studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times. The studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times.

 We found three trials that compared surgical intervention with endoscopy in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The trials included 111 participants. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the UK. The trials were conducted in the early stages of chronic pancreatitis and were conducted in the early stages of the disease. The trials were small and had methodological limitations. The trials were small and had methodological limitations. The trials were of low quality. The
 This review found only one randomised controlled trial that met our inclusion criteria. This trial included 857 patients undergoing minor skin excision surgery in the primary care setting. The wounds were sutured after the excision. The patients were randomly allocated to early post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415) or delayed post-operative bathing (dressing to be retained for at least 48 hours before removal
 We searched for studies that compared prednisone with no treatment in people with Parkinson's disease. We found one study that compared prednisone with no treatment in 35 participants. The study was small and had a high risk of bias. The study did not report the main outcome for this systematic review. The trial did not report side effects in detail, but one prednisone-treated participant died. The trial did not report changes in grip strength
 We searched for studies that compared the use of a remote check-up to being seen face-to-face. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies were generally randomised and included people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with COPD or severe asthma. One study compared the two types of check-up for oral steroid tapering in severe refractory asthma and we assessed it as a separate question. We could not say whether

 We searched for trials up to January 2015 and found six trials. Four trials were small (less than 25 women per arm) and two had moderate to high risk of bias. Four trials compared PFMT as a treatment for prolapse against a control group (n = 857 women); two trials included women having surgery for prolapse and compared PFMT as an adjunct to surgery versus surgery alone (n = 118 women). The largest most rigorous trial to date
 The review of trials found that topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics. However, non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of
 We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants. The studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's. Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS correctly identifies people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time. The use of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will incorrectly diagnose around five
 We included 10 studies, of which 5 were new to this update. All interventions were adjuncts to conventional therapy and were delivered in primary- and secondary-care settings. There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational interventions and 44 participants in the 1 psychological study. The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention groups. It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group

 We found 10 studies involving 2961 surgeons performing an operation in which the use of blunt needles was compared to the use of sharp needles. Four studies focused on abdominal closure, two on caesarean section, two on vaginal repair and two on hip replacement. On average, a surgeon that used sharp needles sustained one glove perforation in three operations. The use of blunt needles will thus prevent one glove perforation in every six operations
 The review included seven randomised controlled trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. The results did not show a difference in efficacy between trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low-
 We found nine eligible trials including 593 infants in total. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants. Meta-analyses, although limited by data quality and availability, suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain (MD <unk>1.36, 95%
 The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of folic acid and multivitamin B supplements on ankle brachial index (ABI) in people with peripheral arterial disease. The authors found two randomised trials with a total of 161 participants. The studies did not report on mortality and rate of limb loss. One trial with 133 participants showed that there was a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (AB
 We searched for studies that compared the effects of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on the placement of sealants in permanent molar teeth. We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study compared the impact of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on the placement of sealants in permanent molar teeth. The study was conducted in the four most deprived areas of Scotland, so the applicability of the findings to other settings may be limited
 We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported in 54 papers involving over 17,000 women and their babies. One trial did not contribute data. Trials were generally at low risk of bias. Zinc supplementation resulted in a small reduction in preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.97 in 16 RCTs; 16 trials of 7637 women). This was not accompanied
 We searched for studies that compared probiotics with other antifungal drugs. We found 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria. All studies used probiotics as an adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs. Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure and mycological cure and decreased the relapse rate at one month. However, this effect did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical or mycological cure. Probiotics
 We included seven trials (involving 696 women) in this update of the review. The trials were conducted in different countries, covering the full spectrum of the World Bank's economic classification. Two trials were conducted in Germany and Italy which are high-income countries, while four trials were conducted in upper-middle income countries; two in Iran, one in Malaysia and the fourth in Turkey, and the seventh trial was conducted in Jordan, which is a lower-middle income

 We included 12 studies involving 2196 participants. Six of these studies provided data on the percentage of pills taken. Reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken (mean difference (MD) 11% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6% to 17%)). Notable heterogeneity occurred among these studies (I2 = 96.3%). Two studies provided data for the proportion of self-reported adherent patients, reporting a reduction in the intervention group which
 We searched for randomised clinical trials comparing these drugs with controls. We found 15 randomised clinical trials evaluating 11 different drugs. All trials had high risk of bias. There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality, liver failure, or perioperative morbidity. The trimetazidine group had a significantly shorter hospital stay than control. There were no significant differences in any of the clinically relevant outcomes in the remaining comparisons. Methylpre
 We included 61 studies, including 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing. The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies, received treatments, reported outcome measures, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which ranged from 2.4%
 The review authors searched for trials that compared the effectiveness of two phytomedicines, Niprisan® (also known as Nicosan®) and Ciklavit® (a phytomedicine that is a dietary supplement) in reducing painful sickle cell disease crises.

We found 11 trials that met our inclusion criteria. The trials were small and had a high risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found that people undergoing orthognathic surgery should be given long-term antibiotics to prevent SSI. However, we found no evidence that short
 We searched for studies that compared the use of preterm birth at 36 weeks' gestation with spontaneous preterm birth. We found one small study, involving 40 infants and 42 women. The study was poorly designed and did not detect any significant differences in the outcomes of caesarean section and neonatal survival to discharge. There were no significant benefits or adverse effects of preterm birth at 36 weeks' gestation for fetal gastroschisis. The primary
 We searched for studies that compared paracetamol with other painkillers, such as opioids, or other non-paracetamol medications. We found three studies in adults, and 95 completed treatment. All studies used paracetamol as an add-on to established treatment with strong opioids (median daily morphine equivalent doses of 60 mg, 70 mg, and 225 mg, with some participants taking several hundred mg of oral morphine equivalents
 The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of antimuscarinic drugs with placebo or other drugs. The review authors found 15 trials that were conducted in China and 14 in hospitals. The trials were of poor quality and the quality of the reporting was poor. Most often the primary outcome was the diameter of the wet patch on the pillow. Antimuscarinics (astemizole, diphenhydramine, propant
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found six studies, comprising 195 participants with MS. Two studies investigated inspiratory muscle training with a threshold device; three studies, expiratory muscle training with a threshold device; and one study, regular breathing exercises. Eighteen participants (<unk> 10%) dropped out; trials reported no serious adverse events. Three studies compared expiratory muscle training versus no active control or sham training. Under a fixed-effect
 This review included one randomised clinical trial in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised to receive betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) or no medication. The trial did not find any difference in the risk of bleeding in the newborn. The trial did not report on the number of women who died, perinatal deaths, postpartum haemorrhage or neonatal intracranial haemorrhage. The review authors did
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found two completed studies, with a total of 111 participants (n = 30 and n = 81), both conducted in Iran. Participants had moderate to severe keratoconus pre-operatively and were randomly allocated to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. Only one eye of each participant was treated as part of the studies. The smaller study had 12 month follow-up data for all
 We searched for studies that compared iron supplements with placebo or no treatment. We included 67 studies, recruiting 8506 women. The number of women included in analyses varied greatly between outcomes, with the largest number of participants analysed (6861 women). Women receiving iron were significantly less likely to be anaemic at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (moderate quality evidence). Women receiving iron had a higher haemoglobin concentration at the end of
 This review included five studies with a total of 1,726 patients. The top-up search resulted in an additional ongoing trial, the results of which have not been incorporated in this review. There was no overall survival benefit of the combination chemotherapy over irinotecan alone, thus both regimens remain reasonable options in treating patients with advanced or metastatic CRC. The quality of evidence for overall survival was low and for progression-free survival was moderate, mainly
 This review found that a transverse or oblique incision has less impact on pulmonary function particularly in the early post-operative period and is less prone to rupture (wound dehiscence/incisional hernia). The data on pain is less clear and should be interpreted with caution but some data suggests a transverse incision is less painful. There was no difference seen in other early or late post-operative complications and recovery times
 We included nine studies with 981 participants. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. The mean age across studies ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. All included studies were judged as having high risk of bias and high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding, and four of the nine studies suffered from at least one additional source of possible bias. In MBR compared to usual care for subacute LBP, individuals receiving MBR had less
 We included 18 trials reporting on 4843 men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone. The evidence is current to May 2014. We found no clear difference in the proportion of men with pain response between bisphosphonates and control regimens in men with prostate cancer metastatic to bone. Bisphosphonates probably reduced the number of skeletal-related events and disease progression. Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of kidney adverse events. We found no clear difference in the number of participants with osteo
 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared HDT + ASCT with chemotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy in patients with relapsed FL. We found five RCTs involving 1093 patients.

 We included 14 studies, including 2488 participants, in this review. The results of this review show that the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rates of incomplete recovery in Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity, or in people with severe Bell's palsy. Corticosteroids alone were probably more effective than antivirals alone and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo
 We searched for studies that compared the effects of LHRH agonists in the treatment of relapsed (platinum-resistant and platinum-refractory) EOC. We found two studies, including 97 women, that compared LHRH agonists (leuprorelin) with a chemotherapeutic agent (treosulfan) and compared them with a placebo (Currie 1994). The studies were
 We found 17 randomised controlled trials that included term and near-term infants with hypoxia. Ten trials compared iNO versus standard care (placebo or standard care without iNO) in infants with moderate or severe severity of illness scores (high-quality evidence). Mercier 1998 compared iNO versus control but allowed back-up treatment with iNO for infants who continued to satisfy the same criteria for severity of illness after two hours.
 This review included seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people). The quality of the studies was rather low. Only five of the fifteen studies met 50% or more of the internal validity items. There was moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective supplements to other preventive interventions. It remains unclear whether lumbar supports are more
 We included 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations. The total number of participants was unclear, as some studies did not provide this information. Most studies enrolled participants from the age of 18 including patients in intensive care units (ICUs), oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition. The magnitude of benefits regarding catheter colonization varied between studies that enrolled different types of participants. For the outcome of catheter
 The review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The interventions took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas. The study locations were mainly Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The participants included 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. There were no dietary intervention studies. All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (
 The evidence is current to May 2014. We included 12 randomised controlled trials (1023 participants) reporting 14 comparisons. The evidence is current to May 2014. The current evidence base does not suggest that foam dressings are more effective in the healing of venous leg ulcers than other wound dressing treatments. The evidence in this area is of low quality. Further evidence is required from well-designed and rigorously-conducted RCTs, that employ methods to minimise bias and report them clearly,
 The review authors searched for studies that compared celecoxib and etoricoxib to placebo in patients with IBD. They found two studies that met the inclusion criteria. One study compared etoricoxib to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The other study compared celecoxib to placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis. Both studies were judged to be at low
 We searched for studies that compared different topical antimicrobial treatments, including antimicrobial dressings, non-antimicrobial dressings, and antimicrobial dressings. We found 22 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The studies mostly had small numbers of participants (from 4 to 37) and relatively short follow-up periods (4 to 24 weeks). We found that more wounds may heal when treated with an antimicrobial dressing than with a non-antimicrobial dressing

 The review authors searched for studies that compared educational interventions to prevent or reduce the use of physical restraints in geriatric long-term care. They included five studies. All of them investigated educational approaches. Two studies offered consultation in addition and two other studies offered guidance for nursing staff in addition. Four studies examined nursing home residents and one study residents in group dwelling units. No studies in community settings were included. Three studies included only one or two nursing homes per study condition.
 The evidence is current to May 2014. We included four studies (416 women) in the review. The studies compared glucocorticoids supplementation during IVF stimulation versus placebo. Two of the studies had data in a form that we could not enter into analysis, so results include data from only two trials (310) women. The evidence was rated as low or very low quality for all outcomes, mainly due to imprecision, with low sample sizes and few events
 We included eight randomised controlled trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in this review.

The results of the study were compared to those of placebo infusion. Pegloticase infusion was
 The review of three studies found that oral immunoglobulin or an IgG/IgA combination did not reduce the incidence of NEC, suspected NEC, need for surgery or death from NEC. The evidence does not support the administration of oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC. There are no randomized controlled trials of oral immunoglobulin alone for the prevention of NEC.
 This review found that postoperative platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a small benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival irrespective of radiotherapy treatment. It reduces the risk of developing a metastasis, could be an alternative to radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy.
 We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high-income settings. We found that some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention.

All studies compared autogenic drainage to one (or more) other recognised airway clearance
 This review found that psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short-term treatment of GAD. The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective. Further studies examining non-CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD.
 We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared progestogen therapy with placebo or no treatment. We included 12 trials (1,856 women) in this review. Eight of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in India, Jordan, UK and USA. In five trials women had had
 We included 14 studies with 1298 pregnant women. Nine studies (704 women) compared CM versus control, and five studies (594 women) compared MIB interventions versus control. We did not find any studies that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions. For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately controlled for biases within their studies as such information was not often reported. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies relating to participant selection,
 We identified 31 studies (44 reports) including 27,071 participants and two ongoing studies. The risk of bias in the studies was low or unclear for several domains. Compared to the transfemoral approach, transradial approach reduced short-term NACE, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and procedural success rates. However, short-term myocardial infarction was similar between both groups. The transradial approach had a lower
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found two studies that met our inclusion criteria. One study was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared palliative care with a control group. The other study was a cluster RCT that compared a decision aid with a decision aid. The two studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible. The two studies measured 31 different outcomes, yet they did not measure
 This review found that the different methods of sequencing CT and RT do not appear to have a major effect on recurrence or survival for women with breast cancer if RT is commenced within seven months after surgery.
 We searched for studies that compared the effects of CrP supplements with other types of exercise, such as resistance or weight training, or with other types of exercise.

All studies focused on breast cancer survivors. The studies were of low quality and were rated as having a high risk of
 We searched for studies up to May 2014. We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. We excluded one trial. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor. Only short-term data were available. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine. One trial reported change scores on the mental
 The review authors searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of a colonic stent with the effectiveness of an emergency surgery. Five randomised trials were identified with a total of 207 participants, 102 to colorectal stenting and 105 to emergency surgery. The average time of clinical relief of obstruction was 0.66 day in the colonic stent group and was 3.55 days in the emergency surgery group. The
 We included nine randomised controlled trials (1867 women) comparing human albumin, HES and mannitol versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of OHSS. The evidence was very low to moderate quality for all comparisons. The main limitations were imprecision, poor reporting of study methods, and failure to blind outcome assessment. There was evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous albumin on OHSS, though heterogeneity was substantial.
 Ten studies involving 484 patients were included in this review. The evidence did not suggest superior efficacy or patient satisfaction for any one sclerosant over another, but there was evidence of superiority of sclerotherapy to placebo. The evidence did not suggest an increase in patient satisfaction with any one agent versus another, but there was evidence that patients were less satisfied with placebo. There was some evidence suggesting that polidocanol (POL)

 We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of sweet potato preparations with placebo (a dummy treatment). We found three RCTs that met our inclusion criteria: these investigated a total of 140 participants and ranged from six weeks to five months in duration. All three trials were performed by the same trialist. Overall, the risk of bias of these trials was unclear or high. All RCTs compared the effect of sweet potato
 We searched for studies that compared the active cycle of breathing technique with other therapies. We included 19 studies with 440 participants. The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 22.33 years). In 13 studies, follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long-term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an
 We included eight studies with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation of sperm and oocytes with the standard insemination protocol. Live birth was not reported in the included studies. The low quality evidence showed that brief co-incubation was associated with an increased ongoing pregnancy rate compared to the standard insemination protocol. Measuring clinical pregnancy rate, there were 93 clinical pregnancies in three studies including
 This review found five studies that recruited a total of 694 infants. The studies were conducted prior to the introduction of antenatal steroids, post natal surfactant and the use of synchronised modes of ventilatory support. Most of the infants had single pathology (HMD) and no studies examined the effects of IT on newborns ventilated for other reasons such as meconium aspiration and congenital heart disease (lungs with normal compliance
 We included 33 studies involving 5110 patients. The studies were of low methodological quality. TFU has been applied in many patient groups. There is a large variety in the ways the TFU was performed (the health professionals who undertook the TFU, frequency, structure, duration, etc.). Many different outcomes have been measured, but only a few were measured across more than one study. Effects are not constant across studies, nor within patient groups. Due to
 We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness of different strategies to improve retention of participants in trials. We found 38 eligible trials. The trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Include
