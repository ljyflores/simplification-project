Thyroid enlargement was not seen after surgery.
We found that there is a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of the lung, which partially encases the right mainstem bronchus (bronchus) and may be due to postobstructive pneumonia. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. However, there is evidence of lymphadenopathy in the region of the right paratracheal lymph nodes, and a subcarinal lymph node. There are other nodules in the upper and middle lobes of the lungs. The heart appears to be normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion. Moderate atherosclerotic aortic and coronary artery calcifications may be seen in the main lung artery measuring 3.4 cm, which may be a cause for concern in the case of high blood pressure. The left para-aortic lymphadenopathies may be the cause of the left adrenal gland enlargement. The thyroid gland is unremarkable. Upper Abdomen: We found evidence of bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi measuring up to 1.5 cm on the left. Nodular enlargement of the adrenal glands. No aggressive bone lesions were found. The major fissure along the right major lobe may have been caused by postobstruction of the bronchi.

The aortic aorta was the same size as before surgery. There were no changes in the size of the thoracic vessels or the heart. There was no change in the number of heart valves that had to be opened for the valve to be re-opened. However, there were some calcified calcifications in the coronary arteries and aortas, which may be due to the presence of blood clots in the blood vessels. There is a chance that these calcifications may have been caused by the patient's age and not by the surgery itself. There are no signs of cancer in the lungs or the airways.

The aortic aneurysm measuring 4.5 cm is noted, which is new from the last follow-up in 2019. There are severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The lung wall is thickened and a loop recorder is noted in the anterior left chest wall. Hypodensities in the liver are again noted, one of which now demonstrates punctate calcifications, new from a prior examination. No aggressive bone lesions have been found. The patient is well-travelled and well-loved by family and friends.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Cochrane Collaboration. The search is up to date as of 3/26/2018. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No pleural effusions. Heart and Vessels: The heart appears normal in size. No pericardial effusion. There are mild coronary calcifications. There is a small hiatal hernia. The airways are patent. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. Upper Abdomen: Status post cholecystectomy. No aggressive bone lesions.
We found that post-surgery changes in the lungs/airways/pleura were stable and no new or enlarging lung nodules were found compared to the prior surgery. No new lung nodles were found after the first surgery. There were no new lung or airway nodules after the second surgery. The right lung was the same size as it was when the first procedure was done. There was no change in the size of the right lung nodule. The left lung had no new nodules. The thoracic aorta and aortic veins were normal size. The heart and vessels were of normal size and there was no pericardial effusion. Upper Abdomen: No new bone lesions were found and there were no aggressive bone lesions. Routine age-related degenerative changes were found in the spine.
We found that the lungs and airways of the lungs appear to be in good shape. There is patchy, but not a lot of change, of the size and shape of the lung in keeping with pneumonia. The heart appears to be normal in size and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion. The aorta and vessels of the heart appear to have a normal course and size. There was no change in the size of the aortic valve. There were no changes in the diameter of the chest wall or in the length of the airways. The lymph nodes did not show any signs of adenopathy.
We found that there is a large amount of emphysema in both lungs. There is a lot of narrowing of the trachea and mainstem airways, which can be seen in bronchomalacia. The tracheostomy tube ends in the airways in the upper thoracic region. There are also a few small airways impacts in the left lung and a small subcentimeter lung nodule in the right lung. The aorta of the heart is large and narrow, with three-vessel coronary arterial calcifications. The main pulmonary artery is dilated, which is a sign of high blood pressure. No signs of arterial thrombosis were found. There were no signs of pleural effusion or pleural edema. There was no evidence of adenopathy of the lungs. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. Aorta is narrow and the main artery is narrowed, which indicates that it is likely to be a source of blood clots. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is severe lung disease with a high risk of pulmonary edema, which could be due to a build-up of fluid in the lungs due to lack of oxygenation of the blood. The lungs appear to have a narrow airway with a small amount of impaction in the mainstem bronchi. The gastrostomy tube is long and thin, which means that the tube may not be able to reach all the way to the lungs and thus may block the airway drainage. The abdomen has a small hernia, which may be caused by aortic stenosis. Upper Abdomen: Small hiatal hernia. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: Partially visualized a C6 compression deformity which is age indeterminant although it appears to be long-term. No definite aggressive osseous lesion has been identified. Ribs: There are bilateral subacute rib fractures.

This is an update of the original review from April 2021. We found that the right breast mass now measures up to 2.5 x 2.0 cm and the right lung has changed from the original 3 mm nodule noted on the April examination to a 7 mm (5.284 mm) subpleural nodule on the July 2021 examination. There is no evidence of any new tumour in the left breast mass. The right lung is still not clear of new tumours and there is still a chance that some of the tumours that were seen in the April study may not have been found. However, the tumour that was found on April 2021 is no longer there and may not be there at all. There are no other changes in the breast mass that we know of. The heart and vessels of the heart are normal in size. No pericardial effusion. The aortic valve of the aorta is normal in shape and size.

This is an overview of the results from the review of lung, heart, heart and blood vessels. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Lungs and airways: The main lung tree (tracheobronchial tree) is patent. There is some evidence of bronchiectasis and scarring to the right of the tracheostomy tube. There are no pleural effusions. No pericardial effusion. No pneumothorax. The aortic artery (the main artery in the heart) is narrowed and narrow with calcified blood in the blood pool, which can be seen with high blood pressure. Heart and Vessels: Heart and vessels: There is evidence of enlargement of the aorta and the myocardium (the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the lungs). There is also a small hernia on the right side of the heart, which may be due to the cholecystoid surgery. Aortic and coronary artery calcifications are more than twice the size of the other major artery and can be associated with anemia. Thyroid enlargement: Thyroid growth is not consistent across the whole body. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm, probably on the basis of congestion. Upper Abdomen: Cholecystectomy for ulcerative colitis was performed prior to the peritoneal resection of the gallbladder. Spine changes: Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. Body wall edema.
We found a 1.2 cm density in the right lower lobe that is lobulated on the coronal plane and could possibly communicate with an airway. There is a trace pericardial effusion. The heart is normal in size. Severe three-vessel coronary arterial calcifications are found in the aorta and there is a small amount of blood loss to the lungs from the heart. The right lobe of the heart appears to be stable from prior surgery. No acute fracture was identified. No aggressive lesion was found. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable except for a punctate splenic calcification that is nonspecific and a left renal cyst. No hematoma was found and no lymphadenopathy was noted. The pelvic ring and femurs are nondiagnostic for fracture due to lack of movement in the pelvis.
We found that there is a large amount of residual air in the pleural space, which could be related to the removal of air from the lungs. There is also a small amount of fluid in the right pleura, which may be due to the body's need to communicate with the air inside the lung. We are not sure if this is a cause for concern or not. We found that the lung wall is thickened and there is some concern that this may be a cause of cystitis. There are a few pockets of bronchial mucoid impaction in the upper lobe of the lung and a right tracheal diverticulum, which is a narrowing in the trachea that leads to the lungs and is thought to be caused by fluid leaking from the lung into the pleura. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable except for a few scattered hepatic hypodensities that are too large to be sure of and left lung and brain scarring. No aggressive osseous lesion was found. There was no lymphadenopathy, ascites, or free intraperitoneal air. A Foley catheter was seen in the bladder lumen.
This is an update of a CT scan from 21 years ago which showed that there was a loss of volume in the lower lobe of the lung and improvement in the upper lobe. However, there is still a lot of fluid in the bronchus and there is a chance that this may not have been caused by the surgery. There is also a possibility that it was caused by an atelectasis of the left lung. This may be caused by a blockage of the blood supply to the lungs from the lungs to the heart. There are no signs of lung collapse or pericardial effusion. The thoracic spine appears to be the same as it was when the original CT scan was done.
This is an overview of the condition of the heart and lungs of patients who have been in hospital for at least 48 hours. The heart is in a stable condition. The lungs are in good condition, but there is some evidence of thickening of the airways in the left lung (pulmonary parenchyma) and there is a possibility that there may be fluid in the lungs (pneumothorax). There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. There are 2 left chest tubes and a mediastinal drain. There is a small amount of air in the central airways and there are no signs of obstruction of the pleural airways. There appears to be no aggressive lesion of the osseous lesion (a lesion is a hole in the lining of the body that leads to the lungs) or of the lungs that may be caused by a blood clot, but this is not known at this time.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Collaboration. We found that there is mild emphysema in the upper lobe of the left lung, which has not changed since the last time we looked at it.

Gastroesophageal (bowel) tissue is thinning and there is a thinning of the stomach wall. No bowel obstruction. No gallstones or gallstones have been found. No patients have died from gallstones. The appendix has not been found to be affected by gallstones, but there is an overgrowth of the appendix wall that may be a cause for concern.
This is an overview of the findings from the most up-to-date search of the medical records. We found that there are a few small pockets of blood in the right ventricle of the heart, but the heart size is normal. There is no pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. The blood pool in the blood pool is too large for blood to reach the heart and there is a risk of anemia. There was no evidence of aneurysm or peribronchovascular hematoma in the left lung. The left perinephric vein is not large, but there is evidence of a blood clot in the upper lobe of the peritoneal cavity. There are no signs of cancer or lymphadenopathy in the chest or the abdomen. No aggressive osseous lesion was found.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. The heart size is stable and there is no evidence of heart enlargement or pericardial effusion. There is no pleural effusion or pleural swelling. There are no signs of cancer or lymphadenopathy in the chest or the pelvis. However, there is an increase in the amount of air in the lower lobe of the lungs with the use of a bronchoscopy. This may be due to the enlargement of the lung wall caused by the heart. The analysis of the abdomen revealed that there is not enough evidence to rule out the presence of cancer in this area.
This is an overview of the evidence from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Cochrane Collaboration. The evidence is up-to-date as of July 2013. The review shows that there is an increase in right supraclavic adenopathy in the right thyroid lobe, with new mass on the right thyrocyte. However, there is a decrease in superior mediastinal adenopathies, and the neck mass has also decreased. The heart size is normal. There is a small pericardial effusion, but there is no change in the size of the heart or the vessels that carry the blood from the heart to the lungs. The neck mass appears to have decreased, as shown by a 1.5 cm pretracheal lymph node, which was previously at least 2.4 cm in size. The left brachiocephalic vein (SVC) remains open, although the confluence of the SVC and SVC is severely narrowed. Other mediastal nodes have also decreased, except for the right hilar adenitis, which has increased in size (1.4cm).

Extensive coronary arterial calcifications are seen. No aggressive osseous lesion was seen.
This is an overview of the findings from a chest X-ray of a breast cancer survivor who had surgery to remove the tumour from the breast. The breast was removed and the breast was resected. The tumour has not spread to other parts of the body. There is a small left pleural effusion in the lower lobe of the lung and a trace right pleural enlargement. The heart is enlarged. Sclerotic foci are found in the ribs and spine and are thought to be from metastases of breast cancer.
This is an update of a prior study from August 2021. We found that the number of lung nodules in the right lung was approximately the same as in the prior study. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion or pleural effusion. The heart and vessels of the aorta were normal size and there were no signs of adenopathy in the heart or vessels. However, there was an increase in the size of the right upper lobe of the lung and there was a small amount of scarring in the left lung consistent with the use of radiotherapy prior to treatment. The thoracic airways were clear. There were no reports of any side effects of the treatment.

Three-vessel coronary calcifications. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Subacute fractures of right fourth through sixth ribs.
We found that the mass in the lung was reduced from 8.5 x 4.7 cm to 4.6 x 3.2 cm by the time of surgery. The mass now measures 1.5 cm shorter than it did before surgery. There was no change in the size of the mass after surgery, but there was an increase in the length of time it took to reach the top of the lung. There were no new or enlarging nodules or tumours in the mass and the mass did not change in size after surgery. However, the mass is still too large to pass through the bronchial wall and there is still a chance that it may block the airway. We found no new tumours or growths in the lymph nodes. The left lung wall thickened and there was improvement in the amount of thickened air in the upper lobe. The lesion in the left lung is stable and no new growths have been found. The right lung is also stable and has not changed in size. The aortic valves of the aorta are still functioning as they should after surgery and heart and blood flow is normal.

This is an overview of the condition of the heart, lungs, airways and other parts of the body. Heart and Vessels: The heart is normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. There are no atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The aorta is large and the pulmonary artery is enlarged, which may be seen in patients with high blood pressure. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There are extensive secretions in the trachea and bronchi extending into the right upper lobe and the bronchi. This is likely to be due to a build-up of fluid in the right lung due to the treatment of lung cancer, but there is a possibility that it is due to other diseases as well. The lungs are stable, but the pleural effusion is increased in the left lung where a chest tube was placed prior to the chest tube being placed.

This is an update of a review first done in 2007. We have updated the review in 2013. We found that there is some evidence of thickening of the esophageal wall, which can be seen in the setting of GERD. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion or pleural effusion. However, there is a possibility that this thickening may be due to the presence of granulomata in the lymph nodes of the lungs. There are no other signs of disease in the lungs or the airways. Heart and Vessels: Mild cardiomegaly with most of the enlargement in the atria of the heart in the left atrium. The aorta is large and the aortic valve may be of use in the case of heart failure. Thyroid abnormalities: Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any of the three main subgroups of the thyroid. There were no signs of adenopathy in the thoracic area. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is some thinning of the bronchial wall in the lower lobe of the left lung, but this is not thought to be caused by disease of the lung wall. Mild scarring in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and the medial part of the same lobe in the right lung. Scattered calcified granulomas are found in the upper lobe. No other lung or airways abnormalities were found. No signs of cancer in the lung or in the pleural area. Upper Abdomen: Partially imaged bilateral renal cysts and other hypodensities too small to assess. Left hepatocellular hypodensity is likely to be a cyst. Tons of tissue in the pelvis and hip area were not imaged. Hemangioma in T7 vertebral body.
Aortic valves and aortic valve and coronary artery calcifications. No new or enlarging lung nodules. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion, but the heart appears to be large and heart-shaped. Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any of the thyroids. No aggressive bone lesions. Mild bilateral gynecomastia.
We found that the right pleural effusion in the pleural space (the space between the lungs and the airways) is still stable, but there is an atelectasis in the right base of the pleura, which may be a sign of increased pleural pressure. We also found that there is a small but stable right apical cavitary lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung (8.5 x 4 x 3.7 cm in diameter) and a diffuse bronchiectasis (inflammation of the bronchus) on the other side of the lung, which is likely to be due to prior lung infections. The heart chambers appear to be normal in size and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion. There is a narrowing of the aorta (the main artery of the heart) at the top of the chest wall that may be an indication of high blood pressure. There are no signs of cancerous growths on the surface of the liver. The thyroid gland is unremarkable and the other parts of the body are unaltered. The airways are patent.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Collaboration. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is a wide spread of lung cancer in the lung and airways. No new nodules have been found.

This is an update of a review published in 2019. We found that there are more tree-in-bud nodles in the upper lobe of the lung (right greater than left) compared to the prior study from 2019. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No lung nodules greater than 5 mm were found. There is a gastrostomy tube with tip and balloon in the gastric body lumen. No pericardial effusion. No thoracic lymphadenopathy was found. The heart chambers appear to be large, and the aorta appears to be of the same size as the rest of the body. The thoracolumbar spinal curve is seen, which may be due to the placement of the tube in the thoracostomy chamber. The airways are patent with retained secretions in the lower bronchi (for example series 3 image 230), with similar to minimally increased lung distal airway bronchiectasis. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The visualized bowel is not obstructed, and there is no ascites or lymphadenitis. No aggressive osseous lesions or acute bony abnormalities are seen. The oesophageal vessels appear to have a thick, dense vasculature, but there are no signs of inflammation at the GE junction.
This is an overview of the findings from the CABG, median sternotomy and mitral annuloplasty. The heart is stably enlarged. No new or enlarging lung nodules have been found. The central airways are patent. There is no evidence of any new disease in the lungs or the airways. The right atrium of the heart is filled with calcified granulomas. The left atrium has not been affected by the enlargement. Thyroid gland enlargement: There are a few large lymph nodes in the right paratracheal lobe and in the upper lobe of the thyroid, but these are not thought to be new. Thyroids: There is a large, heterogeneous thyroid gland in the middle of the lower lobe. There are no new or enlarged lymph nodes. The thyroid gland is not believed to be affected by any new cancer cells. Heart and Vessels: The right-sided hemodialysis catheters run through the heart and end in the atrium. No pericardial effusion was found. Vascular calcification was found in the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Please see the report for findings in the abdomen. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions were found.
This is an update of a review first done in 2007. We found that the lungs and airways of the right lung have thickened and there is evidence of thickening of the bronchial wall (bronchial plexus) in both the right and the left lung. There is no evidence of pleural effusion. The heart and vessels of the aorta appear to be normal in size and no pericardial effusion was found. The right breast has calcified and has a biopsy clip in the right breast. There are no signs of adenopathy in the thoracic area. The left breast has thinning of the pleural wall and a small amount of scarring of the breast wall. There appears to be little or no change in the size of the heart or vessels.
We found that the lungs and airways of the lungs are clear and that the heart and vessels of the aorta are normal in size. The aortic valve of the heart is still functioning as it should. There are no signs of cancer in the lungs or the airways. There is no evidence of tumour of the pleura or pleural effusion. However, there are a number of lymph nodes in the mediastinum measuring up to 1.2 cm in size as well as a 1.8 cm left supraclavaneous lymph node. The thoracic spine appears to be the same as it has been for many years. There were no changes in the spine or in the soft tissues of the neck or the abdomen.
