This is an update of a review first done in 2004. A new search was done in 2010 and a new set of images were added. The original search was run in 2012 and the new search is now up to date as of February 2014. The new search will be added to the list of search points at any time of day or night. This update will be published when the next search is done. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Mild bronchiectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No pulmonary edema. There is no honeycombing or significant reticulation of the trachea or bronchus. However, there is mild air trapped in the lung on expiratory images. This may be due to an inflammation of the lungs that is not thought to be caused by infection. Thyroid and Thyroid Tissue: Thyroid tissue is normal in size. The thyroid is well-preserved. There are no signs of damage to the thyroid. Heart and Vessels: The heart is large and healthy. No pericardial effusion (hole in the heart wall). There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The great blood vessels are large and of good size. There was a common origin of the right brachiocephalic artery and the left common carotid artery from the aorta. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy (scarring of the thoracopharyngeal tissue) or pleural edema (inflammation of the airways) was not found. No evidence of a thoracoscopy was needed. Upper Abdomen: No signs of trauma to the bone or joints were found. There were no aggressive bone or soft tissues found.

This is an update of a CT of the lungs and airways that was performed on the same day as the original original in 2010. There is a thickening of the pleural wall in the right lung, which has not improved since the first CT in 2000. This thickening may be due to metastasis of the tumour to the lungs or to a tumour in the lymph nodes, or both. There are no signs of metastasis in the heart or the vessels of the heart, nor are there any signs of pericardial effusion (a narrowing of the artery that carries blood from the heart to the heart). There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The heart is normal in size. The great blood vessels are of good size, and there is no evidence of blockage of the vessels. No new thoracic adenopathy was found by CT. The tumour was not large or spread to other parts of the body.

This is an overview of the condition of patients who have had esophagus and pancreas surgery to open up a hole in the chest wall to remove esophageal cancer and have been in hospital for more than a year. The surgery was done to remove the cancer from the right lung (tracheobronchial tree) prior to resection of the right lobe of the trachea. The tracheo-pulmonary ventricle is the tube that carries air in and out of the body. A right chest tube leads to the lungs and a left lung to the airway. Both tubes lead to the chest and the left lung has a thin wall that allows air to reach the lungs. The right lung wall is thickened and there is a small hole in it. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or narrowing of the pleural airways. The heart and vessels of the heart are normal in size. The aorta is 42 mm long and the aortic valve has calcifications. There are no major defects in the heart or vessels. However, there is evidence of subcutaneous emphysema in the left lateral chest wall. There may be a large number of subcentimeter-sized lymph nodes in the subcarinal area of the neck. No evidence of cancer in the thyroid area is known.

No pericardial effusion was found. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta were found, but these appear to be unrelated to the heart. There were no changes in the breast and axilla of the right breast.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Airway Group's Cochrane Schizophrenia Group. The evidence is up-to-date as of March 2019. The review shows that there are more sub-4 mm peribronchovascular nodules in the lung and airways, some in a tree-in-bud distribution, and that there is mucus plugging (bibasilar atelectasis) in the distal bronchi. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pericardial effusion. The heart appears to be normal in size. There are some calcified granulomas in the heart and there is a punctate left thyroid mass in the thyroid gland. The body of the lungs is covered in a thick mucus-like mucus that is thought to be caused by small airway disease.
This is an overview of the findings from the current study of the thoracic spine of a woman with thoracoscopy of the lungs, airways and airways of the neck. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Some of these nodules have spread to other parts of the body. Heart and Vessels: No pericardial effusion. Pulmonary artery is normal size.

This is an overview of the findings of the Cochrane Lung and Heart and Lung and Airways and Abdomen review. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is persistent occlusion of the right upper lobe bronchus with mass in the upper lobe of the upper lung, worse than before. There is evidence of lymphangitis spread in the lymph nodes of the lung, which is likely to be due to spread of the cancer in lymph nodes from the lungs to the neck and back. There are new soft tissue changes along the right and left pleural fissures and there is new nodular and soft tissue in the right pericardial fat, which may be related to the spread of lymph cancer or may be caused by infection. The right pleural effusion is now multiloculated and thick-walled with locules along the medial ends of the pleura and within the fissure, which, if left untreated, may be the site of a new and more extensive cancer. The heart is normal in size. Heart and Blood Vessels: There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The great blood vessels are normal in height and size. The descending thoracic aorta has changes consistent with aortic thrombophlebitis (a narrowing of the blood vessels) and is thought to be the cause of the narrowing. No changes in the heart or blood vessels were noted in the other major blood vessels. Abdomens: No aggressive bone lesions were found. Lipoma in the size of the shoulder musculature can be noted. No pneumothorax was found in the left lung. There was no change in the number of people who had to have surgery for lung cancer in the chest or in the lungs. There were no deaths in either lung or the airways. The examination of the chest and lungs revealed that there was no evidence of a need for surgery on the chest wall or on the lungs or the lungs and airways, but there was some evidence of inflammation of the heart and blood vessel walls.

The heart and vessels appear to be normal in size and there is no change in the size of the pericardial effusion. The airways are patent. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or narrowing of the pleura. There are no signs of trauma to the lungs, airways or pleura, but there is a small hernia in the right thyroid measuring up to 3.6 cm (4:48 cm) and a large subcutaneous nodule in the mid anterior chest wall, likely a sebaceous cyst, which is a type of cyst that grows in the body from the skin to the blood vessels. The thyroid is not thought to be a source of cancer. The hernia is likely to be caused by a blood clot in the thyroid muscle and is not known to cause cancer. No signs of cancer in the thoracic area or in the lymph nodes. No changes in the heart or the vessels.

The thoracic adenopathy appears to be no worse than in the patients who had surgery on the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The heart and vessels of the heart appear normal in size. There was a small amount of pericardial (vessel) fluid posteriorly. The aorta appears to run along the length of the body and has the same size as the aortic ventricles. The thyroid gland again appears atrophic. Upper Abdomen: Please see separately dictated report for findings in the abdomen. Thyroid gland enlargement: An atrophic lesion was found in the T6 vertebrae of the neck, previously measuring 1.3 cm, at an initial sclerotic lesion of 1.1 cm. The lesion grew to 2.1cm at the time of surgery and is still there.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Airways and Abdomen Group. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There was some thickening of the bronchial wall and bronchiectasis in the right lung base and bronchus. There was improvement in the left lung base, but not in the other lungs or the airways. There were no new lung nodules in the upper lobe of the lung on the first follow-up in July 2021. However, there were a few new nodules on the left ventricle on the third follow up in July 2019. There are no new pleural effusion or enlarging of lymph nodes in the pleura. Thyroid enlargement was not seen after thyroid surgery. Heart and Vessels: Cardiomegaly is a type of heart disease in which the heart is formed in both the left and the right chambers of the heart. The main cause of this is enlargement of the atria and ventricles of the lungs. There is a narrowing of the blood supply to the lungs and airways, which can lead to lung collapse and death. The heart and blood vessels are narrowed and may be blocked by blood clots.
We found that there is a spiculated mass in the right upper lobe of the right bronchi (bronchi are the airways of the lungs) that partially encases the right mainstem bronchus (the airway that carries air from the lungs to the lungs). This mass may be caused by a large spiculate mass originating from the right paratracheal lobe. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax (collapse of the airway wall). There is evidence of lymphadenopathy in the para-aortic lymph nodes, which may be due to a blockage of the aortic and coronary artery. The main pulmonary artery is large (3.4 cm) and may be seen in the case of high blood pressure. There are other nodules in the upper and lower lobes of the left adrenal gland measuring up to 1.2 cm and a prominent left supraclavicular lymph node measuring 9 mm. The thyroid gland is unremarkable. The heart appears to be normal in size. No pericardial effusion was seen in this study. There was no change in the volume of blood in the vessels of the heart or in the size of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the blood vessels. Upper Abdomen: There was a large nonobstructing renal tumour on the left side of the pelvis. No changes in bone or cartilage were seen. There were no changes in other parts of the body such as the liver, kidneys or lungs.
This is an overview of changes in heart, lungs, airways, and pleura of the thoracic spine after heart valve and aortic valve surgery. The heart and vessels are stable. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart and Vessels: Stable heart size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary artery and the veins of the heart and heart and vessel are found in both heart and blood vessels. Upper Abdomen: No new pleural or pleural enlargement or narrowing of the pleura. Central airways are clear. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No more lymph nodes were found in the chest after surgery. Thyroid enlargement was not found in any of the thyroids. Heal of the sternum and sternum was complete after sternotomy. No aggressive bony lesions were found. Routine age-related degenerative changes were found throughout the spine.

Pulmonary artery is normal size. Heart and Vessels: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Normal thyroid. Upper Abdomen: No aggressive bone lesions. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No adenopathy by CT size criteria.
This is an update of a review first done in 2007. The original review was last updated in 2013. The review now has several new findings. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Lung wall thickening and foci of distal mucoid impaction in the right and left tracheobronchial wall. New tree-in-bud nodules in the upper lobe and right middle lobe. No pleural effusion. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. Coronary artery, aortic valve calcifications are present. Common origin of the right brachiocephalic and left common carotid artery (a branch of the blood stream that leads to the brain) is from the aortical arch (the arch of the heart). Ascending aorta measures 34 mm long. No pericardial effusion or narrowing of the artery. Thyroid lobe: Thyroid is a large gland in the neck of the neck that drains the blood from the neck and is the source of a large amount of blood loss to the lungs and other parts of the body. Stable left and right thyroid lobe is heterogeneous. No enlarging of lymph nodes were found. No thoracic adenopathy (scarring of the thoracoid bone) was found after surgery for haemodialysis (removal of the thyroid gland) in the left humerus (head of the head) prior to surgery to remove the thyroids (thyroid glands). Thyroid surgery was performed on the left thyroid lobe prior to removal of the thyroxine in the same day as the thyrogastric surgery on the right thyroid lobe. Bone and soft tissues: Stable L1 (shin bone) and L1 compression fracture of the L1 vertebrae. Osteotomies were performed on both the left and the right humeral head. No fractures were found in the back of the brain or the neck. No changes in the size of the lungs or the airways or in the pleural space.
This is an overview of the thoracic spine and lung and airways of patients with thoracoscopy. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Scattered calcified granulomas. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild bronchiectasis. No suspicious pulmonary nodules. No pericardial effusion. Heart and Vessels: Normal heart size. Normal course and size of the aorta. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Upper Abdomen: Visualized portion of the abdominal organs are normal. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No signs of adenopathy (scarring of the neck) or adenophlebitis (inflammation of the lymph nodes). Thyroid: Thyroid is normal.
This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine and lungs of patients who have had thoracoscopy to look for signs of lung and airway disease. The surgery was performed on the right side of the spine to open up the lungs and remove the diseased airways. The results show that the lungs are stable and no new or enlarging lung nodules have been found. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart and vessels of the heart are normal size and the aortic valve is normal size. There are no signs of cancer in any of the major veins or arteries in the spine. The spine is stable after surgery and there is no change in the size or shape of the thyroid gland or the lymph nodes. However, there are signs of large airway changes including a thickening of the bronchial wall and calcifications of the coronary arteries and aorta.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Airways and Tumour Group. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Central tracheobronchial tree is patent. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Stable right upper lobe 13 x 9 mm nodule (3:126); this nodule was previously biopsied and shown to be benign pathology. Severe upper lobe bronchiectasis with large apical bullae (4:65) and a 5 mm left apical nodule have resolved. Mucoid impaction in the left upper lobe has resolved and is not thought to be caused by the tracheostomy tube. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any of the lymph nodes. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions.
This is an overview of the findings from this Cochrane review. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No new or enlarging nodules. The airways are patent. No pleural effusions. Heart and Vessels: The heart appears normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Airways and Pneumothorax study. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Large amount of secretions in the trachea. There is severe cystic and varicoid bronchiectasis. Some of the cysts show signs of air-fluid levels (for example left upper lobe 4:204) and some of the disease has progressed (4:278). No pleural effusion or pleural abscess was found. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion, pleural or peritoneal effusion. Thyroid: Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any of the three thyroids (thyroids are the outermost layers of the thyroid that support the body's volume and volume of blood). Thyroid disease is not known to be caused by a tumour, but may be due to damage to the thyroid cells. There were no signs of cancerous growths in the thyroid (thyroid) or in the lymph nodes (lymph nodes are the part of the body that carries the lymphocytes that make up the blood vessels that carry the blood around the body and help the body to move around and move around). The heart and vessels: The heart appears normal in size. The aorta, aortic valve and the valves of the aortas appear to be the same size and shape as the rest of the heart. There are some calcifications in both breasts, but these are not large and are not thought to be cancerous. However, there is a chance that they are due to the presence of bone in the breast tissue. There may be some calcification in the size of 2.2 cm in the right breast and there is new in the upper lobe of the right upper lobe, which has not been seen before. The left breast appears to have the same amount of calcified tissue as the other breasts. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: Multiple vertebral hemangiomata versus osteopenia. No signs of osteoporosis.
This is an overview of the findings from a CT scan of the left lung of patients with acute myocardial infarction. There are a few lung nodules in the lower lobe of the right lung, but these are not stable and have not been found on previous CT scans. There is a 4 mm nodule in the right upper lobe and a 1.6 mm left lung nodule. No thoracic lymphadenopathy has been found, but a 1 cm thyroid nodule has been noted. The main pulmonary artery is dilated, which may be a sign of high blood flow in the lungs. Extensive collateral vessels are seen throughout the left chest wall. No aggressive osseous lesion has been seen. A mild compression fracture of the T6 vertebral body is stable.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. Thyroid and Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Thyroid enlargement in all lobes of the right thyroid with new dense consolidation in the right upper lobe. Stable right middle lobe nodularity. Lungs and airways: There is no evidence of cancer in any of the lungs or airways or of the pleural effusion. There is some evidence of tumour in the neck of the lung. No signs of disease in the other parts of the body. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. Small amount of pericardial fluid. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Mild bilateral gynecomastia.
This is an update of a tracheostomy that was performed on a patient who was in the ICU for more than a year. The patient was found to have a narrowing in the airways of the lungs and a narrowing of the pleura (pulmonary ventricles) in both the upper lobe and both the lower lobe. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found. The heart and vessels of the heart appear normal in size and there was no evidence of pericardial effusion. The aorta appears to be of the same size as the rest of the body. Worsening of pleural consolidation in the right upper lobe of the lung and both lower lobes is a cause for concern. However, examination of these two lobes may have been done in a way that may account for some of the apparent parenchymal haziness.
This is an overview of the thoracic spine and lungs and airways of patients with thoracoscopy of the spine. The spine is the top of the neck and the lungs are in the chest. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is evidence of large airway disease including mild bronchiectasis and multiple areas of mucoid impaction. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There are some fissures in the airways and there is a small number of pulmonary nodules in the right lung. However, these nodules are not large and do not need to be treated. Heart and Vessels: No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No signs of adenopathy in the neck or in the lymph nodes. Thyroid enlargement is normal. No changes in the number of thyroids. Upper Abdomen: No aggressive bone lesions. Routine age-related degenerative changes are seen in the spine and are thought to be due to the age of the bones.
This is an overview of the findings from the CABG. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is no improvement in lung function and there is a moderate risk of atelectasis. The heart appears normal in size.

This is an overview of the condition of patients with bronchial wall thickening (bronchial plexus thickening) and pleural fluid in the right lung and subsegmental atelectasis in the lower lobe of the left lung. A right chest tube is inserted and the tip of the tube is in the region of the right ventricle. There is a very small right anteriorly layering (pneumothorax) of air in the airways and a very large right pleural gap (an air gap is a hole in the lung wall that leads to the airway that is not filled with air) of a right lung. This hole is thought to be caused by the growth of a cancer in the inferior lingula of the lower lung. There are no other signs of disease in the lungs or airways.

Mild thickening of the bronchial wall is thought to be due to thickened blood in the lungs consistent with airways disease. No suspicious pulmonary nodules or mass. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion or narrowing of the aorta. Heart and Vessels: Heart is large and of good size. There is no evidence of aortic aneurysm or myocardial infarction. Thyroid: Thyroid is normal and appears to be in the same place as the other parts of the body. No signs of cancer or lymph nodes. Upper Abdomen: Left breast has a small amount of bone in the left breast. No evidence of cancer in the right breast. Melanoma of the breast was not found in the breast X-rayed in the last two X-rays taken in the first half of the 20th century.
This is an overview of the findings from the review of the thoracic spine of people who have had thoracoscopy to look at changes in the structure and function of the lungs, airways, heart and vessels of the spine. The spine is a thin layer of bone between the lungs and the heart and the blood vessels that carries blood from the lungs to the heart. The bone is usually of good size but there is some narrowing of the bone in the left and right lungs. There is some thinning of the distal esophageal wall. There are no new lymph nodes or lymph nodes in the esophagus or in the paraesophagus. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax has been found. The heart is normal size and the aorta is of normal size. The neck is thin and the spine is of good shape. No new bone lesions have been found in the neck or thoracopharyngeal area. However, there has been an increase in the size of some of the thyroid nodules in the lower lobe of the neck.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane thoracoscopy and Radioscopy Group's (RCTs) study of the thoracic spine and lung and airways in adults with thoracopharyngeal cancer. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: A right-sided lipoma (lipoma in the airways) is likely to be originating from the extrapleural space in the right lung measuring up to 5.2 cm in size. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found. The 1 cm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule in series 4 image 283 is unchanged compared with the most recent study and is stable in size going back to study from December 2020, however it is new compared to the first study from January 2010. There are associated enlarged airways. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. Signs of large airway disease including diffuse mild bronchiectasis. Central airways are clear. Heart and Vessels: No pericardial effusion. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Mild calcifications of the coronary arteries and aorta. Calcification of the aortic valve. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No signs of adenopathy. Thyroid enlargement: No changes in the number of thyroids in the neck or in the mass of the thyroid. Normal thyroid.

There is a minimally displaced fracture of the left lateral 5th rib in the left ventricle of the thoracic lobe of the pelvis. No acute compression fracture deformity. Central height loss of the T4 and T5 vertebrae appears to be a long-term problem and is not thought to be caused by the compression of the rib cage. However, there is mild stranding in the rib spaces between the left 3-4-4, 4-5 and 5-6 intercostal rib spaces, which is posttraumatic. Heart and Vessels: The heart appears normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: The lower thoracics are either not clearly visualized or not visualized. Central airways are patent. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No signs of adenopathy.

This is an overview of the findings from a large-scale study of the thoracic spine of adults with thoracoscopy of the heart, lungs, and airways of people who have had a heart or lung transplant from the chest. The heart and vessels of the aorta are normal size and there are no new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found. There is no evidence of adenopathy (scarring of the lungs or airways) of the chest or of the airways. However, there are some calcified calcifications of the coronary arteries and aortas in the heart and the vessels. There are no changes in the size of the thyroid nodules or in the number of lymph nodes in the neck or the back of the neck.
We found that the volume loss of the left lung is stable, but there is an increase of fibrotic changes in the left lobe at the top of the lung, including left upper lobe cavitation. However, there is also an increase in the number of pulmonary nodules, for instance a 5 mm right lower lobe nodule on series 5, image 232; and an unchanged 6 mm left lung nodule. There is right apical pleuroparenchymal scarring. No pleural effusion. No new thoracic adenopathy by size criteria. The thyroid is heterogeneous. The heart and vessels of the heart appear normal in size.
This review shows that there is no evidence of lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion from the tumour in either lung. However, there is a small number of sub-5 mm lung nodules in the lower lobe of the right lung and one sub-8 mm nodule in the upper lobe. There is no clear evidence of tumour spread to other parts of the body. The tumour appears to be confined to the diaphragm area.
This is an update of the original review from November 2014. No other new noncalcified pulmonary nodules have been found. There is a 4.8 x 4.6 x 6.2 cm right apical lung mass which was found in the upper lobe of the lung and does not cross the major fissure. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax has been seen. There are no other new pleural or arterial lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are located in the middle of the thoracic aorta between the lungs and the heart and are of a normal size. The pulmonary artery is normal size and there are no new calcified calcifications in the coronary arteries or the veins of the heart or the blood vessels. The thyroid is normal and there is no change in the number of thyroids or the size of the aortas or the thyroid gland. The body's airways are clear and clear of any obstruction.
This is an overview of the thoracic spine and other parts of the body. The spine is a thin, thin layer of bone between the heart and the lungs, and the airways and airways of the lungs and the heart. It is the area that carries blood from the lungs to the heart, the blood supply to the blood vessels and the body, and carries the blood that carries oxygen in the blood stream. This is the part of the spine that carries air from the heart to the lungs. Some of the changes in the spine may be due to the age of the spinal cord, but the spine does not seem to change with age. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax (collapsed lung). The airways are clear. Heart and Vessels: No pericardial effusion. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries and aorta. Upper Abdomen: None of the abdominal organs appear to have changed in any major way. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Thyroid enlargement: No change in the size or shape of the thyroid.
We found no new or enlarging pulmonary nodules or lymph nodes. There is a stable 1.1 cm left thyrotropium nodule in the lower lobe of the left lung and a stable 2 cm left thyroid thyroid nodule. Both nodules are stable. However, there is a moderate amount of calcification in the heart and vessels of the heart. No pleural effusion was seen. No pericardial effusion or narrowing of the pleura was noted. A right chest wall Chemo-Port terminates in the distal SVC. A pacemaker is in place.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane thoracoscopy (CT) study of the thoracic spine and lung and airways. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There was a decrease in the size of the lung nodules compared to study from September 2021. There was no change in the number of pleural effusions. There were also no changes in the amount of air in the lungs or the airways or in the mainstem bronchi or the trachea. However, there was an increase in the volume of fluid in the upper airways and in the heart and vessels. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Heart and Vessels: Left atrial enlargement. No pericardial effusion. Severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries and aorta were found in the coronary artery and the main artery of the heart. This was not seen with the CABG from September 2012 to September 2017. Lung and airway consolidation: Overall there was a slight decrease in lung consolidation compared to the study from December 2017 to September 2019. There is no evidence of a change in volume loss in either lung or airway. There are no signs of cancer in the lung or the lungs. No signs of disease in the airway or the bronchi. Thyroid enlargement was not found in either heart or the atria or the blood vessels. No evidence of cancer of the thyroid was found in any of the other parts of the body. No changes in bone and soft tissues were found. Upper Abdomen: No changes were seen in the bone or soft tissues.
This is an update of a study from August 2021. Some of the nodules seen on the prior study from 2021 have resolved.

This is a summary of a Cochrane review of the effects of thyroid cancer on the lungs, airways, heart, and blood vessels of the thyroid. Thyroid cancer is a tumour of the thyroids originating in the thyroid gland and spread to the other parts of the body. It is thought to be caused by the growth of lymph nodes in the lungs and the airways. The thyroid is a small gland in the neck of the neck that drains the blood from the body and causes a thickening of the pleura (thoracic margin of the lungs). Thyroid disease is a disease of the blood cells that can lead to cancerous growths in the lung and the blood stream and can be a cause of chronic pleural effusion in the right lung and basilar septal thickening in the left lung. There is no evidence that this is caused by cancer of the lymph nodes.
We found that the tracheobronchial tree is patent. There is a mild thickening of the bronchial wall in the right lung, which may be seen in patients with high blood pressure. The heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion. The aortic aneurysm measuring 4.5 cm is noted, which is the same as it was in 2019. There are severe atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The pulmonary artery is large and shows signs of enlargement. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found. There was no evidence of pleural edema or pleural oedema. There were no signs of cancer or lymph nodes in any of the lymph nodes. Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any lymph nodes or in the thyroid. The visualized thyroid is normal. The examination of the liver revealed hypodensities in the liver, one of which now shows punctate calcifications, new from a prior chest X-ray. Bone and Soft Tissues: No new bone or soft tissues were found. The X-rays did not show any changes in the bone structure or the soft tissues. Heart and Vessels: The heart was not affected by narrowing or narrowing of the vessels.
This is an update of the original review published in 2013. There is no new evidence of periosteophyte fibrosis or pleural effusion. The lung and airways appear to be intact. The heart appears to be normal in size. There are mild coronary calcifications and a small hernia in the chest. The airways are patent. No aggressive bone lesions were found. There was no evidence of thoracic adenopathy (scarring in the thoracoskeletal area of the back of the neck). There is a small hiatal hernia.
This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine after surgery to open up the lungs and airways and to the heart and blood vessels. Changes in the lungs/airways/pleura are stable. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules were found after surgery compared to the prior surgery. There is no evidence of a change in the size of the right lung or airways or of the heart or blood vessel. The right lung is still full of fluid and the right pleural space is the same size as it was when the first surgery was done. There are no new lung nodules along the right bronchial stump. No pneumothorax (collapsed lung) was found. The airways are clear and the heart is still normal size. There was no change in size of either the coronary artery or the aorta. The thyroid gland did not show any signs of cancer after surgery. No changes were found in the bone structure or in the soft tissues below the diaphragm.
We found that the lungs and airways appear to be in good shape. There is no cavitation. The heart appears to be normal in size and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion. The aorta is normal and the aortic valve is of the same size and shape as the rest of the body. There are no signs of trauma to the lungs or airways, but there is a possibility that there may be a hole in the lung wall that may be caused by a blood clot, or that the airways may be inflamed.
We found that there is a large amount of emphysema in both lungs and airways of both lungs. There is a lot of narrowing of the main bronchi (mainstem bronchi) which can be seen in bronchomalacia, which is a lung disease that is caused by high blood pressure. There are also a few small nodles in the upper bronchi, which are likely to be caused by a blockage of the bronchi. However, there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The aorta of the heart is normal in size, but there are three-vessel coronary arterial calcifications noted. The main pulmonary artery is dilated, which means that the blood is pumped out from the lungs through the aortic valve into the heart at the top of the lungs at the time of heart surgery. No signs of adenopathy were found in the thoracic adenopathies. The hernia was not large. There were no signs of trauma to the pelvis or hip bone. There was no evidence that the hernia caused by the gastrostomy tube was caused by an arterial blockage.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Clear lungs. No new signs of lung cancer or pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Calcified granuloma in the right upper lobe of the lung was found. No other signs of disease. Heart and Vessels: Question mild cardiomegaly with predominantly left ventricle enlargement. Aorta is normal in course and size. No coronary artery or aortic calcifications. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Mild bilateral gynecomastia. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: Left axillary lymph nodes measure up to 1.0 cm but have a normal fatty hilum suggesting benign etiology. No additional enlarged lymph nodes were found.

Stable 5 mm subpleural nodule in the right lung. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No pneumonia or pulmonary edema. No other lung or airway enlargement was noted. The tracheostomy tube is still in place. There is no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Heart and Vessels: The heart is normal in size. There are no atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. The great and aortic blood vessels are normal in the short- and long-term. The lymph nodes: Worsening left axillary adenopathy, measuring up to 4.2 cm in diameter, was found on a CT scan of the lymph nodes in the lower lobe of the neck. There was no change in the size of any of the other adenopathies. Thyroid and Tumour: The thyroid is well-preserved and the tumour appears to be confined to the back of the head and neck. Upper Abdomen: Periportal adenitis is noted, better evaluated on abdominal CT dated 10/23/2021. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions.
This is a summary of a Cochrane review of lung and airways and heart surgery for patients with ILD. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Lungs are not affected by pleural effusion or pneumothorax. However, there are a large number of pleural nodules and lymph nodes in the lower lobe of the lungs. This can be seen as a feature of old age. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Aortic and aortic valve calcifications were found in both chambers of the heart. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: Increased number of subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes with subcarinal nodes measuring up to 13 mm.
This is an update of a review first done in 2004. A new version of this review was done in 2008. The original review was last done in 2012. The new version was added in 2013. The patient is in the ICU at a tertiary hospital in the USA. The surgery was performed on the thoracic aortic valve in the chest. The heart and vessels were examined with a platelet-rich blood stream (PRF) from the right atrium to the right ventricle and back to the abdominal aorta. Aortic dissection was not possible due to the presence of a blood clot in the carotid artery, but a flap was seen in the artery that feeds the blood from the heart to the abdomen. No evidence of lung or airway problems. No signs of adenopathy of the lungs or airways were found. No pericardial effusion was found. There is no evidence of any other problems. The main problem is that the patient is too large to be followed up.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Central tracheobronchial tree is patent. Large pleural effusion in the upper lobe of the trachea.

The thyroid gland is missing from the neck of the neck. The main pulmonary artery is long and narrow, with a diameter of 3.4 cm. The airways are patent. The right atrioventricular vein (the main artery of the lungs) is long, narrow and narrow. The left atrium is wide and narrow with a length of 2.8 cm.
This is an update of the original review from April 2021. The original review showed that the right breast mass now measures up to 2.5 x 2.0 cm. The right lung mass is stable and the right subpleural reticulations and bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe and right middle lobe of the right lung are not clearly seen and may have resolved. There is no evidence of thoracic adenopathy (scarring of the thoracoskeletal system) in either lung. The heart and vessels of the heart are normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion. The aortic valve of the aorta is calcified and the left vertebral artery comes from the arch of the vertebrae. The left subpectoral lymph nodes are still too small to be seen.
This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine after lung and airway surgery. Changes in the lungs/airways/Pleura: No new or enlarging lung nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Signs of airway disease including diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Heart and Vessels: No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries and aortas of the heart and heart vessels are found in both the coronary artery and the main artery of the blood supply to the heart. Upper Abdomen: No changes in bone and soft tissues. No aggressive bone lesions. Thyroid: Thyroid enlargement was not seen in the lower lobe of the neck after lung surgery. There was no evidence of adenopathy in the neck or in the lymph nodes.

Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. Heart and Vessels: Heart is large and well-preserved. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions.
This is a summary of a Cochrane review of the results from the Cochrane Lung and Airways and Pneumothorax/Pleura Group. Lungs/Airways Disease: Thickening of the bronchial wall (bronchial plexus) and narrowing of the airways (pleura) is consistent with airways disease. No pleural effusion or pleural abscess. No new or enlarging lung or airways nodules or lymph nodes have been found. Thyroid: Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any of the three thyrotropium nodules. No evidence of adenopathy of the thyroid. Heart and Vessels: The heart chambers appear normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Ascending aorta: Coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
This is an overview of the results of the most up-to-date, best-known study of this type of surgery. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Numerous sub-4 mm lung nodules were found. No new or enlarging nodules have been found. The airways are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found. Heart and Vessels: The heart chambers appear normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. No axillary, subpectoral, or internal mammary adenopathies were found by CT. Thyroid: Thyroid enlargement was not found in any of the lymph nodes. The thyroid is enlarged, similar to that found after breast cancer surgery. Upper Abdomen: Findings below the diaphragm are dictated separately. Sclerotic metastasis in the thoracics spine appears similar distribution.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study of the thoracic spine of patients with thoracoscopy of the lungs and airways. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are clear. Heart and Vessels: No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary and aortic veins are found in the heart and vessels. Thyroid (thyroid gland) and Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No more or fewer thyroid nodules in the lower lobe of the lung than in the other parts of the body. Nodular thyroid with a subcentimeter thyroid nodule in the right lower lobe is still the same as it was in the previous studies. Upper Abdomen: Visualized portion of the abdominal organs are unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Routine age-related degenerative changes are seen throughout the spine.
This is an update of a study that was done in 2007 and found no new or enlarging pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no evidence that the aortic valve has changed in size or shape. The aorta measures up to 4.2 cm in the axial plane and there is no change in the size of the heart or the heart valve in the coronary artery. There are also no changes in calcified calcifications of the coronary arteries and aortas. The largest of these is a simple cyst in the left kidney. The thyroid is still normal. The heart and blood vessels are the same size as they were in the prior study. No pericardial effusion has been found. No changes have been found in the number of people who have had their heart or blood vessel size reduced by surgery.
This is an update of a review first done in 2007. The original version was last updated in 2010. The new version is up-to-date as of February 2015. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: The tracheobronchial tree (tracheotomy to open up the trachea and airways) is patent. There is some evidence of bronchiectasis and scarring associated to the right upper apical (bronchoid) wall of the bronchus. There are no signs of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No pericardial effusion. Aortic and coronary artery calcifications can be seen in both the main and aortic veins. The blood in the blood pool is less than the myocardium, which is a sign of anemia. Heart and Vessels: Cardiomegaly with predominantly biatrial and probably left ventricle enlargement. Ascending aorta measures 39 mm. The main pulmonary artery is dilated (32 mm) which can be shown with pulmonary hypertension. Severe calcifications in the aortics of the heart and the coronary artery can be observed. Upper Abdomen: Prior cholecystectomy. Thyroid and Spine: Thyroid enlargement is not seen in all cases, but is thought to be due to over-growth of the thyroid cells. No evidence of periartical enlargement or narrowing of the pleural space. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: Mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1 cm, probably on the size of the lymph nodes, can be noted on the basis of congestion. Small hiatus hernia. Osseous and soft tissues: Multilevel changes of the spine. Body wall edema.
Aorta and aortic valves are filled with blood clots. Heart is normal in size. Severe three-vessel coronary arterial calcifications are found in the aorta. There is a trace pericardial effusion. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable except for a punctate splenic calcification that is nonspecific and a left renal cyst. There are no bowel obstruction, ascites, or lymphadenopathy. The pelvis and pelvis appear to be stable but the pelvic ring and femurs may not be stable enough to be tested for fracture due to lack of movement in the pelvis. No hematoma was found. There was a 1.2 cm density in the right lower lobe that is lobulated on the coronal plane and could possibly communicate with an airway, suggestive of mucoid impaction. No airway was found to be blocked or blocked in the lower lobes.
This is an overview of the post-pneumonectomies of patients who have had lung surgery to remove the airways of the lungs from the lungs. The lungs are filled with fluid and there is a small amount of air in the pleural space, which could be a sign that the lungs have been cleared of air after the surgery. However, there is also a chance that this may be due to the patient's habitus (e.g. the way the lungs sit in the thoracic chamber) or the fact that the lung is too narrow for this to be the cause. There is a thin line of air between the lungs and the pleura (a thin tube that leads to the lungs). This may be caused by a narrowing of the airway, but there is no evidence of a rupture of the lung wall that would cause a lung to open up and allow air to flow back into the lung. There are no signs of infection or obstruction of the bowel. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable, except for a few scattered hepatic hypodensities that are too large to be sure of and left renal cortical scarring. A right upper lobe apical 12 mm groundglass nodule new from prior (series 5, image 178) and a right lower lobe segmental bronchi (bronchial tube) impaction, which may be from an infectious or inflammatory etiology. No left pleura scarring was noted. Endotracheal tube tip terminates in the mid-trachea of the size of 13 mm. Noted old bilateral rib fracture deformities. No aggressive osseous lesion. An enteric tube is seen in the gastric body. No bowel obstruction. There was no lymphadenopathy, ascites, or free intraperitoneal air. A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder lumen. Bladder wall thickening is noted. No signs of cystitis. No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
This is an update of the original review published in 2010. The results show that volume loss in the left lower lobe of the trachea (tracheostomy tube) appears to have improved. There is a subsegmental atelectasis involving the inferior left lingula. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found. However, there is still a large hole in the airway between the lungs and airway of the lungs. There are no signs of pericardial effusion. The spine of the thoracic vertebrae appears unchanged. No signs of adenopathy of the neck or of the head and neck of the spine. There was no change in the height of several vertebraes in the back of the back.
This is an overview of the condition of patients who have been admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in the USA. All patients have had chest surgery to open up the airways (pulmonary parenchyma) and chest tubes and a drain have been placed into the chest. There is no pleural effusion in the left lung. There appears to be some thickening of the airway wall in the lower lobe of the lung, with air bronchogram results indicating that this may be due to a build-up of fluid in the lung. The heart size is large and heart rate is high. There are no signs of trauma to the bones or soft tissue.
This is an overview of the condition of patients who have been admitted to the ICU following heart surgery or cholecystoscopy for heart or lung surgery. We found that there is some soft tissue emphysema in the upper lobe of the left lung and in the right lung. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or narrowing of the pleural airways. The heart size is normal. The spleen is large, measuring 15.3 cm in length, and the patient is noted to be in a stable condition after surgery to the spleen.
This is an update of the original review published in 2010. The patient is noted to be in a stable condition post wedge resection in the left lower lobe. There is no new lung or airway nodule. There are no new pulmonary nodules in the right lung. The central airways are patent. The heart size is normal. No new pleural or pericardial effusion has been found. A right hepatic lobe cyst is found in the upper abdomen. No aggressive osseous lesion has been identified.
We found that the heart, lungs, airways, and airways of the lungs are all normal in size. There is a small amount of blood in the blood vessels of the heart and there is some evidence of heart disease in the coronary arteries. There are dense atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary artery walls. The heart has a left-side aortic arch and a right-side arch. The trachea is midline and patent. Lungs/airways/pleura: There are a few pulmonary nodules in the right lung and the left lung. Mild atelectasis is likely to be due to the presence of a blood clot in the lungs. No pulmonary consolidation was found. No pleural effusions were found, but there is apical pleural scarring. Heart and blood vessels: The heart is large and healthy. The blood supply to the heart is from the lungs to the lungs and from the heart to the sternum. The aorta drains blood from the chest to the pelvis and the rest of the body. Aortic arteries, renal arteries, the celiac axis, and iliac arteries are patent. Bone and soft tissues: There is evidence of a sclerotic focus in the posterior right eighth rib on image 327, series 5, measuring 1268 Hounsfield units, likely a bone island. No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion. Pancreas: Fatty atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma has been found in the pancreas. Adrenal glands: The left adrenal gland is nodular. The regional gland is normal.. Kidneys: Multiple left renal cysts measuring up to 8.9 cm are found in both in the liver and the caudate lobe of the left kidney. No hydroureteronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. Gastroesophageal cancer is not known to be a cause of this type of cancer. Gallbladder and gallbladder: No evidence of gallstones or gallstones were found. Bowel: Limited evaluation of the stomach was possible due to an underdistention and a streak of scarring from surgical clips in the region of the gastric junction. However, there is a thinning of the gut wall and no evidence of bowel blockage. The appendix is normal. Thyroid gland: Thyroid cancer is a rare and rare disease and is not thought to be caused by a blockage of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is in the middle of the neck and has not been found to be affected by the heart or lungs. Lymph nodes: Prominent 0.6 cm periportal lymph nodes in the left mesenteric region in the mesentrum of the chest are in the upper arm and are thought to represent an early Schmorl's node, a type of lymph node. No lymph node has been identified in the lower arm. No other lymph nodes have been seen in the other parts of the thoracic region or the lungs or the airways or the bile ducts. The lymph nodes may be in the same area as the lymph nodes, but the evidence is not clear. The evidence is up to date as of July 2014.

The results show that there is an increase in the amount of air in the lower lobe of the lungs and a decrease in the number of patients with bronchodilators in the upper lobe. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or narrowing of the pleural airways. The heart size is large and the pericardial effusion has not been found. There are no signs of lymphadenopathy in the chest or the pelvis. The bone and soft tissue surrounding the heart and pelvis appear to be healthy.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Collaboration. The evidence is up-to-date as of July 2013. The review shows that there is an increase in right supraclavicular adenopathy, which can be seen from the neck, with new mass on the right thyroid lobe. However, there is a decrease in superior mediastinal adenitis, which has not been seen in the neck before. There is a reexpansion of the left brachiocephalic vein, but the confluence of the vein and SVC remains, although the SVC is severely narrowed. Other mediastal adenopathies have also decreased, as shown by a 1.5 cm pretracheal node, which was previously at least 2.4 cm in size. The heart size is normal. A small pericardial effusion is found, but no new mass has been found. No new mass was found on the thyroid lobe of the neck. The neck mass has decreased, but there is still a new mass in the right thyro-thyroid lobe, which is at least twice the size of the original mass. The left thyrotropium node has increased in size, and the left axillary lymph nodes have decreased. The bone and soft tissues of the lower neck have not been found to be changed in any major way. No aggressive osseous lesion was found.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Parenteral Respirator's Group (LRRG) study. The heart size is normal.

This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine that have been seen after surgery to treat patients with thoracoscopy of the neck and thoracopharyngeal cancer. The spine is a thin layer of bone and cartilage between the lungs and the airways, and the heart and blood vessels. Changes in the spine are due to the age of the spine and are not thought to be related to the cancer but may be due to age-related degenerative changes. There is no new or enlarging lung nodules in the lower lobe of the lungs. The airways are clear. The heart is normal size and the aorta is of the same size as the rest of the body. However, there are a few calcified calcifications in the coronary artery and the main artery of the heart. No new or large pleural nodules have been found in the lungs or airways. No pleural effusion was found in either lung or airway. There was no change in the amount of fluid in the pleural space between the lung and airways or in the number of patients who had a pneumothorax (hole in the lung wall) after surgery. There were no changes to the size of the thyroid gland or the lymph nodes.

No other new or worse forms of lung cancer have been seen in the same area of the body. No aggressive bone lesions have been noted in the upper body.
A 5 mm right upper lobe lung nodule was found in the upper lobe of the lung. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion. The tumour appears to be confined to the diaphragm area.
This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2004. The review shows that there is a marked improvement in the number of new and enlarging pulmonary nodules and pleural effusions in the lungs and airways, but not in the heart or vessels. There is no change in the size or shape of the heart and vessels. However, there is worsening of the mass on the left main pulmonary artery, which has not yet been drained of blood, and there is an increase in the volume of blood in the mainstem bronchi, which is greater on left than on the right. There are no new pleural or pericardial effusions. The esophagus is patulous. The central airways are patent.

Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No adenopathy. Nodular thyroid with subcentimeter-sized thyroid nodules is found in the neck and is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of the thyrotropium (thyroid cells) in the area just above the collarbone. There is a right-sided chest port with catheter tip in the right atrium.
This is an overview of the findings from a chest X-ray of the aortic valve of the heart. The heart valve is the valve that carries blood from the lungs to the heart and is the source of the blood supply to the lungs. This is the area where blood is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body. Aortic valves are the valves that carry blood around the body and are the cause of heart attack and stroke. The angioplasty showed that there is a lot of blood in these valves. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion. However, there was a large amount of calcified blood in the valves and there was some evidence of thickening of the myocardium and apical aneurysm.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is bibasilar consolidations and reticular markings. Scarring/atelectasis is seen in the right lung and in the upper lobe of the lung. No thoracic adenopathy (scarring in the thoracoskeletal area of the thorax) was found.

The distal esophagus is fluid-filled, the mid and upper esophageal wall is collapsed and there is a possibility of mild growth of a tumour on the esophagium. Thyroid tumour: There are several subcentimeter left thyrotropium nodules in the neck of the neck. The tumour has not spread to other parts of the body. No other tumours were found. Gastric banding: The gastric band is still in place and stable. Upper Abdomen: The upper abdomen is filled with fluid. No new tumours have been found since the band was put on. No further surgery is planned. Bone and soft tissues: No new bone lesions have been identified.
We found that the heart and blood vessels are normal in size and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion or narrowing of the aorta. However, there is a moderate risk of coronary artery atherosclerosis. The heart appears to have a normal course and there are mild changes in the size and shape of the coronary artery. The lungs are normal and the airways are patent. The kidneys are shrunken and atrophied. There is stable dextroscoliosis in the lower half of the body. The right adrenal calcification is likely from a long-term inflammatory or hemorrhage process.

Changes in the spine may be due to the presence of small or large airway nodules, heart or blood vessels, or both. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax (collapse of the airway wall) or of a narrowing of the pleura (hole in the lung wall that leads to the lungs). There are no signs of cancer of the lungs or the airways or of the heart or the aorta.

The heart and vessels of the heart and the lungs/airways/pleura show signs of thickening of the bronchial wall. There is a small amount of mucous secretions in the trachea extending into the right lower lobe branches of the lungs. There are no signs of narrowing of the aorta or of the main pulmonary artery. No pericardial effusion (hole in the heart) or narrowing in the coronary artery (clotting of the artery wall) has been found.
This review shows that fibrotic lung and airways are stable and that the heart and vessels of the aortic valve chambers appear normal in size. No new or enlarging lung nodules have been found. No pleural effusions were found. There is no new thoracic adenopathy. However, there are some changes in the shape and size of the lower lobe of the lungs, which may be due to the growth of pleural reticulations, but these changes are not severe and are not thought to be caused by the disease itself. The thyroid gland is well-preserved and the heart chambers appear to be of good size.
We found that the mass in the upper lobe of the lung is no longer as large as it was when we first examined it. The mass now measures 4.4 cm long and 2.2 cm wide. It has spread out to the left side of the pleura and is attached to the major fissure in the pericardium. There is a 1.1 cm left apical nodule that is stable and 1.9 cm spiculated groundglass nodule with a 7 mm solid component that is still in place. The rest of the mass has spread to the right side and is stable. There are no new sclerotic lesions. Aortic and coronary artery calcifications are similar to those we found before. The heart and vessels of the heart are normal in size and there are no calcifications in the coronary artery or aortic vein. The esophagus is filled with fluid and some of the esophageal tissue is covered by a thin layer of fat. The tumour has not spread to other parts of the body and is still confined to the lungs and airways. The lymph nodes are still in the same place as they were when we examined them prior to the surgery. The neck of the chest has not changed in size nor has the mass spread across it. There was no change in the amount of fluid in the blood stream or in the size of the artery or the heart or the blood vessels. There were no changes in the volume of blood in the lungs or the airways or the lungs. The bronchial wall is thickening.

This is an overview of the condition of the heart, lungs, airways and other parts of the body. The heart is normal in size. The aorta is large and the pulmonary artery is enlarged, which may be seen in patients with high blood pressure. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There are extensive secretions in the trachea and bronchi extending into the right upper lobe and the bronchi. There is a small pleural effusion in the right pleural lobe that may be due to prior pleural blockage (pneumothorax) and there is a trace pleural obstruction on the right ventricle that may have been caused by a chest tube that was placed prior to the time of the chest tube placement. There are no signs of cancer or lymph nodes in the lymph nodes of the thyroid. The thyroid is normal size.

This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine and lungs of patients who have had a thoracoscopy of the spine to look for signs of lung and airway changes. The spine is the largest part of the body and the lungs are the smallest. Changes in the spine are due to the age of the spinal cord and are not thought to be due to cancer or heart disease. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Mild paraseptal emphysematous changes with an increase in lung size in the upper lobe of the lungs. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. Heart and Vessels: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Pulmonary artery is normal size. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries and aorta. Right-sided chest port with catheter tip in the right atrium. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No lymph nodes have been found to show signs of adenopathy (scarring of the lymph nodes).

Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions.
We found that the lungs and airways of the lungs are stable and the airways are patent. There is a marked dilatation of the pulmonary artery, which may be seen in patients with high blood pressure. The heart is normal in size and there are no pericardial effusion or narrowing of the vessels of the heart. There are severe coronary artery calcifications in the right heart and there is a small hernia on the right side of the chest wall. The hernia is probably caused by a hernia that did not heal after surgery, but may also be caused by the blockage of the artery by which the stents were inserted. There was no change in the number of nodules in the neck or in the thoracic lymph nodes. However, there is an increase of subcutaneous thickening along the inferior inferior chest wall, which is a sign of sclerotic damage. The upper chest wall has not changed in the last 10 years.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Airways and Pneumothorax study. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: The tracheobronchial tree is stable. No new or enlarging nodules or tumours have been found. No pleural effusion or pleural oedema. The heart appears to be normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Coronary artery and aortic calcifications. Upper Abdomen: Reported separately. Thyroid and Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. The thyroid is unremarkable.
This is an overview of the findings from the review of the thoracic spine of patients who have had a thoracoscopy to look at the heart, lungs, airways and pleura to see if there are any changes in the structure or function of these parts of the body. We found that there are some changes to the structure and function of the spine, lungs and airways, and the heart and vessels of the aorta. There is a narrowing of the pleura in the right lung and reticulations in the left lung which may be due to a long-term lung infection. There are no signs of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) in either lung. The heart and blood vessels are normal size and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion (hole in the wall of the heart) or of narrowing in the pulmonary artery (the main artery that carries blood from the lungs to the heart). There is also a right-sided pleural effusion in the chest which is probably due to an open pleural leak. The tumour on the right side of the lung is not large or large enough to be seen with the scope of the angioplasty, but it is not clear if it is still there or not.
This is an overview of the findings of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Cochrane Lung and Airways Group (CHNG) study. The evidence is up-to-date as of July 2013.

This is an overview of the evidence from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group. The evidence is up-to-date as of March 2014. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: There is a cystic tracheobronchial tree. There is emphysema and large airways disease. There was a 5 mm nodule in the left lower lobe of the left lung that was stable over a long period of time. However, there was a 2 cm increase in the size of the nodule at the site of surgery and this may be a sign of a new tumour. Thyroid: Thyroid is normal in size. There were no changes in the number of thyroids (thyroids are the outermost layers of the thyroid that line the body and support the body's volume and volume of blood). Thyroid enlargement may be due to the growth of lymph nodes in the right paratracheal lobe. No changes were seen in the other parts of the body. Heart and Vessels: The heart is large and healthy, but there is a slight enlargement of the pericardial septum. There are no atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. Punctate aortic valvular calcification is noted. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions were found. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was found.
This is an update of a review first done in 2009. We found no new or enlarging pulmonary nodules or lymph nodes in the left major fissure measuring up to 1.3 cm (4.273 cm) in that area. There was a decrease in right pleural effusion, but there is still a small amount of pleural fluid remaining. There is no change in the size of the right pericardiophrenic lymph nodes or the subcentimeter of the mediastinal lymph nodes. No new or large lung nodules were found. Thyroid enlargement was not seen in any of the other parts of the body. The heart and vessels of the heart are normal in size. No pericardial effusion was found in the aorta or near the heart. There are a few broken bones in the rib cage, some of which have improved with time and are thought to be healing. The left breast of the left breast is known to have metastatic breast cancer, but the cause is not known. The right breast has not been found to have spread to the other breast. The thyroid is not seen to have changed in any way. The hernia was not found to be a hernia, but may have been caused by a blood clot in the hernia and may not be healed. There were no other problems with the thyroid.
This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine and lungs following thoracoscopy. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: Mild centrilobular emphysematous changes with an upper lobe predominance. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Signs of large airway disease including diffuse bronchial wall thickening.
This is a summary of a Cochrane review of CT scans of the heart, lungs, airways and pleura. The heart is normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. There are moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of the coronary arteries. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No lung or airway problems were noted. The gallbladder has a large amount of low-pitched noise from recent heart catheters. The thyroid is normal size and there is no evidence of thyroid cancer. The great blood vessels are normal size. The liver is too small to assess the risk of aortic stenosis. No other problems were found.
This is a summary of a Cochrane review of published in 2008. The evidence is up to date as of February 2014. The review shows that there is a lot of scarring in the trachea and lungs of the neck, but not in the airways or the pleura (pulmonary ventricles) or the heart. There is no evidence of cancer in the neck or in the lungs. However, there is some evidence that the scarring is due to granulomatous (scarring on the surface of the throat) disease. There may be some calcification of the thyroid (thyroid tissue) in the upper lobe of the left lung and in the left lower lobe, but this is not thought to be caused by cancer. No new or enlarging nodules or tumours have been found. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax has been reported. The heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Lung and Airways and Pneumothorax/Pleura (Pleural effusion) and Heart and Vessels (Cardiomegaly/Vessels) review. Lungs/Airways: Diffuse bronchiectasis and scattered foci of mucoid impaction. Multiple groundglass and solid nodules are noted, including a 1.2 cm nodule in the left lobe of the right lung. While most are unchanged, the right lower lobe lesion is enlarged from 13 mm and 2020 and 9 mm in 2019. There are no pleural effusions. No pericardial effusion. The heart and vessels: Mild heart and blood vessel enlargement. Moderate coronary artery calcifications. Thyroid and Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. The thyroid gland is unremarkable. Postprocedural changes again seen in the right breast, including biopsy clips. The esophagus is patulous and contains intraluminal debris.
This is an overview of the findings of the Cochrane Lungs/Airways/Pleura and Tumour and Bone/Vulva/Thyroid/Oesophagus/Abdomen/Tumour (CTS/CTS) study. Lungs and Airways: There is no evidence of lung cancer in this group of patients. There is evidence of atelectasis in the upper lobe of the lung, which may be due to a disease of the lungs or the airways, but the evidence is not clear. There are no signs of disease in the other lung types. The heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion (a narrowing of the artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs) or coronary artery calcifications ( calcification of the blood vessels that carry blood to the heart). The great blood vessels of the heart and the vessels around the heart are of good size. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Thyroid and Bone: No signs of cancer in the thyroids or the thyroid mass. The thyroid mass appears to be normal size and volume. The left breast appears to have no new bone growth after surgery. No changes in the appearance of the left breast after surgery have been seen in the X-ray of the breast. The right breast does not appear to have any new growths or growths. The neck of the neck may have a new growth, but it is not obvious at this time. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: Mild mediastinal adenopathy measuring up to 11 mm in size is the most likely cause of this type of adenocytosis.

This is an overview of changes in the thoracic spine that have been seen in people who have had a thoracoscopy of the spine. The results show that there are changes in some parts of the spinal cord and in the lungs and airways, but not in the heart or airways. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. However, there is an atelectasis of the right lower lobe of the left lung and a new mass in the right upper lobe which is likely to encase the right mainstem bronchus. This is new compared with the abdominal CT from March 2021 which showed no change in the size of the lung or of the airways or the pleura or the pericardial effusion compared to the study from January 2017. There are also changes to the right paratracheal adenopathy which is a type of deep vein thrombophlebitis which is usually caused by narrowing of the veins in the neck and is thought to be caused by the growth of lymph nodes. These changes are not known to be life-changing but are likely to occur with age.
This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's study of the thoracic spine in adults. The evidence is up to date as of December 2019.

This is an overview of the findings from the review of the esophagus and lungs/airways/pleura of patients with esophageal cancer after esophagostomy for gastric resection and gastric pull-through (removal of gastric contents). The review shows that there is no evidence of a leak of contrast in the extraluminal part of the gastric wall. There is evidence of thickening of the bronchial wall and a pocket of air next to the right ventricle wall (pulmonary plexus) that may be due to increased scarring. However, there is also evidence that the defect in the right patellar wall is still there but not as large as it was on the first post-exam (5:67) and may represent a fold in the patellofemoral wall. The heart is normal in size. Aortic and coronary artery calcifications are found in both the right and left chambers of the heart and aortic vein.

This is an overview of the findings from the Cochrane CABG and is up-to-date as of March 2014. The CABg showed that the lungs and airways were clear of any new or enlarging lung or airway nodules. The heart was also clear of new nodules and calcification was noted in the aorta and in the vessels of the heart. There was no evidence of a new pleural effusion in the pleura or pericardial effusion. However, there was a significant increase in the size of some of the lymph nodes in the upper lobe of the thyroid gland. There were also some calcified granulomas in the right paratracheal lymph node and a 1 cm enlargement of the thyrotropium (thyroid gland) in the atria of the right lung. Thyroid gland enlargement was reported in both the right and the left lung and the atrioventricular vein. No new or large pulmonary nodules were found in either lung or the airways. The thyroid gland was found to be large and had spread out to the other parts of the body. There is no evidence that any of the other organs were affected. The patient is in a stable condition.
This is an update of a review first done in 2007. The original review was done in 2009. The review now has been re-ran in 2013 and a new version was added in 2014. This update is up-to-date as of February 2015. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: The tracheobronchial tree is patent. Diffuse bronchial thickening. Stable interlobular septal thickening in the right lung. No pleural effusions. No pericardial effusion. Subsegmental atelectasis of the left lower lobe was found in the left hemidiaphragm. Stabilised right apical 4 mm nodule (5:80). Stable 5 mm right upper lobe nodule, 5:116, and 5:261 right lower lobe nodules. All three nodules are in the upper lobe of the aortic ventricle. Aortic and coronary artery calcifications. The heart and vessels appear normal in size. No thoracic adenopathy. Upper Abdomen: Reported. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: Widespread oesophageal cancer spread to the other parts of the body and is thought to be caused by metastasis from the tumour in the breast tissue. Complications of the heart and blood vessels are not yet known.
This is an overview of the findings from the review of published in The Cochrane Laryngoscopy and Radiothoracic Network (TRANSCORP) database. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No signs of lung cancer. No pleural effusion. Heart and Vessels: The heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion or narrowing of the aortic valve. Moderate triple vessel coronary artery calcifications and calcification of the valve that carries the blood from the heart to the lungs. Mediastinum/Lymphs: There is evidence of a number of lymph nodes in the thoracic region of the thorax measuring up to 1.2 cm as well as a 1.8 cm left supraclavicular lymph node. There is no evidence of any tumour of the lungs or the airways or of the pleura. Upper Abdomen: Please see separately dictated report for findings in the abdomen. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No changes in bone and soft tissues. Degenerative changes of the spine.
Aortic and coronary artery and aortic valve calcifications are rare. No pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild bronchiectasis in the left lung base (3:405) and tree-in-bud nodules in the lower lobe of the lung (4:405). No new or enlarging nodules. Heart and Vessels: The heart appears normal in size. Normal course and size of the aorta. No calcifications in the coronary artery. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. Thyroid and Pancreas: Thyroid enlargement is not known to be a cause for concern. No other abnormalities were found.
