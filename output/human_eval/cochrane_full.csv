1,"We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. Types of surgery included ear, nose or throat surgery, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy, hip joint replacement surgery, knee joint replacement surgery, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy, thyroid surgery, elective caesarean section, and laparoscopic surgery. Racemic ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions 2 to 5 µg/kg/minute; 10 studies used only S-ketamine and one only R-ketamine. Risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size; most had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis. Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents (95% CI 6 to 9; 19% from 42 mg consumed by participants given placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 65 studies, 4004 participants). Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (95% CI 10 to 15; 19% from 67 mg with placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 37 studies, 2449 participants). Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced pain at rest at 24 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (95% CI 4 to 7; 19% lower from 26/100 mm with placebo, high-quality evidence; 82 studies, 5004 participants), and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm (95% CI 3 to 7; 22% lower from 23/100 mm, high-quality evidence; 49 studies, 2962 participants). Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours (6/100 mm, 14% lower from 42/100 mm, moderate-quality evidence; 29 studies, 1806 participants), and 48 hours (6/100 mm, 16% lower from 37 mm, low-quality evidence; 23 studies, 1353 participants). Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity. No analysis by dose was possible. There was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small-study effects likely but testing not possible. Ketamine increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request by 54 minutes (95% CI 37 to 71 minutes), from a mean of 39 minutes with placebo (moderate-quality evidence; 31 studies, 1678 participants). Ketamine reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia by 7 cm² (95% CI −11.9 to −2.2), compared with placebo (very low-quality evidence; 7 studies 333 participants). We downgraded the quality of evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400. CNS adverse events occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse events. Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4; high-quality evidence; 105 studies, 6538 participants). Ketamine reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting from 27% with placebo to 23% with ketamine (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96; the number needed to treat to prevent one episode of postoperative nausea and vomiting with perioperative intravenous ketamine administration was 24 (95% CI 16 to 54; high-quality evidence; 95 studies, 5965 participants). Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain intensity. Results were consistent in different operation types or timing of ketamine administration, with larger and smaller studies, and by higher and lower pain intensity. CNS adverse events were little different with ketamine or control. Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small extent, of arguable clinical relevance.","We included 130 studies with 8341 participants.

The quality of evidence was high for pain reduction at rest and pain during movement, and high for reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting, and moderate for reduction of postoperative hyperalgesia (low for nausea and dizziness). Side effects occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse events. The evidence was of high quality for pain relief at rest, pain at movement, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. We rated the quality as moderate or very low for postoperative pain relief.

We also found that ketamine reduces pain by 8 mg morphine equivalent over 24 hours, and reduces opioid consumption by 13 mg. We were able to combine the results of 65 studies, which showed that intravenously administered ketamine was effective in reducing pain by 19% to 19% more than placebo (a dummy pill). We found evidence that intravenial ketamine is effective in decreasing pain at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, and reducing pain during movements by 14% to 16% (moderate-quality evidence). We did find evidence that ketamines reduced nausea and vomiting after surgery by 23% to 27% (high-quality and moderate-quality results, respectively). We were unable to analyse the effects of ketamines on the number of people who experienced CNS (neck and neck) adverse events. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of small-study effects or because the number was too small. We rated the quality as high for pain at the rest of the operation, moderate for pain during the operation and pain at 48 and 24 hours after the operation (high for pain), and very low for nausea and nausea after the surgery (moderate quality evidence).

Over 48 hours, people given ketamine needed 13 more analgesics (10 to 15 mg per kg/minute) than those given placebo (19% from 67 mg per hour).

Currently there is a clear lack of evidence to recommend the use azathiprine in chronic asthma for the treatment. Large, long-term studies with pre-defined steroid reducing protocols are required before recommendations for clinical practice can be made.', 'The purpose of this review was to see if azathioprine, a drug commonly used for bronchiolitis, is a useful drug in the treatment of patients with bronchitis. We found only one small study (involving 23 patients) that met the inclusion criteria for the review. We did not find any new studies since the last Cochrane review in 2010. There are too few data available at this time to be able to draw any conclusions about the benefit or harm of the drug in bronchial exacerbations. Large, long-term studies are required.']","[0, 1, 3, 2]"
15,"For this update we identified a total of 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies). A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. In relation to diagnosis, we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast and prostate cancer but not for those with haematological malignancies. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance. The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention.","In this updated review we identified 56 studies (4068 participants) for inclusion (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies).

We combined the results of 28 of these studies (28 in the previous version of this review, 28 in the current version) and found that exercise on the whole was more effective than no exercise. We also found that people with breast and prostate cancer who had cancer were more likely to be tired than people with other cancers. We did not find any studies that looked at the effects on tiredneath, blood tests, or other types of cancer.

We found that people with cancer-related tiredness during or post-adjuvant cancer were more likely to exercise than those with no tiredness. This was true for both breast cancer and prostate cancer. We did not find evidence for those with other cancers (e.g. prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer), or those with haematological cancers (a cancer growing in a blood stream).

16,"We screened 1796 records and identified five eligible trials in total i.e. one trial could be added on the previous review. These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). We included all five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials were co-ordinated in Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials were performed in Italy and the EORTC 20012 was conducted in Belgium. The overall risk of performance and detection bias was low for overall survival (OS), but was high for other outcomes, as therapy blinding was not feasible. The remaining 'Risk of bias' domains were low and unclear. All trials reported results for OS and progression-free survival (PFS). In contrast to the our first published review (2011) the addition of results from the EORTC 20012 BEACOPP escalated increases OS (3142 participants; HR 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.97; high-quality evidence). This means that only 90 (70 to 117) patients will die after five years in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 120 in the ABVD arm. This survival advantage is also reflected in an increased PFS with BEACOPP escalated (3142 participants; HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.64); moderate-quality evidence), meaning that after five years only 144 (121 to 168) patients will experience a progress, relapse or death in the BEACOPP escalated arm compared to 250 in the ABVD arm. There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality (2700 participants, RR 2.15 (95% CI = 0.93 to 4.95), low-quality evidence). Although the occurrence of MDS or AML may increase with BEACOPP escalated (3332 participants, RR 3.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 11.21); low-quality evidence)), there is no evidence for a difference between both regimens for overall secondary malignancies (3332 participants, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.48), low-quality evidence). However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours which would not be expected to show significance until around 15 years after treatment. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured (106 participants, RR 1.37 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.26), very low-quality evidence). This is a very small sample, and the age of the patients was not detailed. No analysis of male fertility was provided. Five trials reported adverse events and the analysis shows that the escalated BEACOPP regimens probably causes more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV ((anaemia: 2425 participants, RR 10.67 (95% CI 7.14 to 15.93); neutropenia: 519 participants, RR 1.80 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.13); thrombocytopenia: 2425 participants, RR 18.12 (95% CI 11.77 to 27.92); infections: 2425 participants, RR 3.73 (95% CI 2.58 to 5.38), all low-quality evidence). Only one trial (EORTC 20012) planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported. This meta-analysis provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable and advanced stage HL benefit regarding OS and PFS from first-line chemotherapy including escalated BEACOPP. The proven benefit in OS for patients with advanced HL is a new finding of this updated review due to the inclusion of the results from the EORTC 20012 trial. Furthermore, there is only low-quality evidence of a difference in the total number of secondary malignancies, as the follow-up period might be too short to detect meaningful differences. Low-quality evidence also suggests that people treated with escalated BEACOPP may have a higher risk to develop secondary AML or MDS. Due to the availability of only very low-quality evidence available, we are unable to come to a conclusion in terms of infertility. This review does for the first time suggest a survival benefit. However, it is clear from this review that BEACOPP escalated may be more toxic that ABVD, and very important long-term side effects of second malignancies and infertility have not been sufficiently analysed yet.","We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) of adults (16 to 65 years of age) with HL.

These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age) with HL. The trials were conducted in Germany, Italy and Belgium. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that patients treated with advanced HL who had been diagnosed with advanced disease after first-line chemotherapy had a higher survival rate (OS) compared to patients treated without advanced disease. However, the evidence was of low quality. The survival advantage was not seen in patients with advanced cancer. The addition of results from the EORTC 20012 trial showed that patients who had their treatment escalated had a better survival rate. However the trial was too small to be able to show a difference in the number of patients who died. The EORC 20012 study did not report quality of life, so we could not assess this. The quality of the evidence for survival was high for patients with HL who were treated with escalated chemotherapy. The overall quality of evidence for the other outcomes was low or very low. The main reasons for this were that the trials were small and the results were not consistent. The included trials were too small and had a high risk of bias. The results of this review are based on five trials, which included a total of 3427 people. The majority of the trials included adults with advanced and advanced HL. We found that people treated with accelerated chemotherapy had better survival compared to those treated with conventional chemotherapy. However this finding is based on only five trials. The number of people who died was low and the quality of this evidence was low. There was no evidence for a difference between the two groups for treatment-related deaths.

The overall risk of bias was low for overall survival (OS), but high for other outcomes, as it was not possible to blind people to the treatment group (i.e. progression-free survival (PFS)). The quality of evidence for OS and PFS was rated as high for OS, and low for all other outcomes. This means that after five years only 90 (70 to 117) patients will be alive in the BEACOPP arm and 120 (124 to 168) patients in the ABVD arm. We are very uncertain about how many women will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured. No information on male fertility was provided.

Only one of the trials (EORTC 20012) planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported. This meta-analysis showed that adult patients with HL aged 16 to 60 years may have an OS of 90% and a PFS of 4.0%. This is based on moderate- to high-certainty evidence from three trials (3332 participants) and low-quality evidence from one trial (2332 patients) and very low-risk of MDS or AML.

However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be able to show a difference in the rate of second solid tumours, which would not be expected to show significance up to 15 years after the end of treatment.

18,"We included no new trials in this update. We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interest. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged. Although not statistically significant using a strict P < 0.05 criterion, data were consistent with women allocated to admission CTG having, on average, a higher probability of an increase in incidence of caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.44, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the average treatment effect across included trials between women allocated to admission CTG and women allocated to intermittent auscultation in instrumental vaginal birth (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.27, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 38%, low quality evidence) and perinatal mortality rate (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.47, 4 trials, 11,339 infants, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence). Women allocated to admission CTG had, on average, higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48, 3 trials, 10,753 women, I² = 79%, low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.45, 3 trials, 10,757 women, I² = 0%) than women allocated to intermittent auscultation. There were no differences between groups in other secondary outcome measures including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (incidence only reported) (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.90; 2367 infants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence) and incidence of seizures in the neonatal period (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.61; 8056 infants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). There were no data reported for severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age. Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the admission CTG for low-risk women on admission in labour. Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour. Women should be informed that admission CTG is likely associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section without evidence of benefit. Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel. All four included trials were conducted in developed Western European countries. One additional study is ongoing. The usefulness of the findings of this review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices. However, an absence of benefit and likely harm associated with admission CTG will have relevance for countries where questions are being asked about the role of the admission CTG. Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and before a formal diagnosis of labour. This would include a cohort of women currently having admission CTGs and not included in current trials.","We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interests. Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged. Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel. There was no clear difference in the average treatment effect across included trials between women allocated to CTG and women given intermittent auscultation in instrumental vaginal birth and perinatal mortality rate. Women allocated to admission CTG had, on average, a higher probability of an increase in the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in the number of babies who died before birth. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. There were no differences between groups in other secondary outcome measures including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (incidence only reported) and incidence of seizures in the neonatal period (in one trial involving 8056 infants; low quality evidence). We found no data reported for severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age. Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the CTG for low-risk women on admission in labour in this review. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admissionCTG should not be used for women who are low risk on admission to hospital. Women should be informed that admission CTGs are likely associated with an increase of caesarian section rate without evidence of any benefit. Furthermore, the probability is that women allocated CTG have, on an average, 20% more caesaryan sections. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The usefulness of the findings of the review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices.","[""We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place. One trial was funded by a Scottish government-sponsored organisation. The evidence is current to September 2014. The trials were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in the labour. The women were followed up for between one and three months. The studies were assessed as low risk of bias. The results of this review suggest that women admitted to hospital with low-risk pregnancies should not have CTG. The use of CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20% in women admitted with low risk pregnancies. Women also had higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour and fetal blood sampling. There were no differences between groups in other outcomes including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (a brain disorder in which the baby's brain is deprived of oxygen), seizures in the newborn period and severe neurodevelopmental disability.

We found four trials involving more than 13,000 women. Three of the trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one by the UK (UK and Ireland). All four of the included trials were conducted in the UK and Ireland. All four trials included women who were low-risk at risk of having a caesarean section because they were in labour at term. We did not find any new trials for the update of this review, which was first published in 2012. We reran the search in May 2017 and found one new trial. We will deal with this study when we next update the review. We included four randomised trials with a total of 13,071 women in labour. The studies were of moderate to very low risk of bias. We rated the quality of the evidence as low for most of the outcomes due to the lack of information provided in the previous version of this Cochrane review (2011). We found no new trials in this update. The evidence is current to May 2017. In this update, we did not identify any new randomised controlled trials. The previous review found that women who received the CTG had, on average, a 20% increase in the number of caesaresan section rates compared with those who received intermittent auscultation (4 trials, 11,338 women). There was no clear difference in the rates of perinatal deaths (4 randomised, moderate- to very-low-risk) between those who had a CTG and those who did not (3 trials, 10,757 participants). There were no differences between groups in other outcomes such as incidence of low blood flow in the neonatal period (1 study, 8056 infants) and the rate of seizures in the baby (1 small study, very low- risk of seizures) during labour (1 large study, low-to-very low-level of risk). No data were available for women at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age. We do not know if the use of CTG is useful for women who are low risk on admission in labour because we found no evidence to show that it is useful. We recommend that the CCG not be used for those who are not low risk.', 'This update includes no new trials. Four trials with over 13,000 women from the UK and Ireland were analyzed.

We have considered that it would be unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time as waiting for a diagnosis of breast cancer, as this is when they are most likely to receive treatment.

There were considerable differences in the methods of local anaesthetic instillation including the location (subdiaphragmatic, gallbladder bed, or both locations) and timing (before or after the removal of gallbladder) between the trials.

Endoscopic stenting with plastic stents was associated with a reduced risk of complications (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.81), but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 - 64.86) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stents (p=0.07, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32, 1.04). One published study compared metal stents to surgery and reported lower costs and better quality-of-life with metal stents.   Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents. Metal stents were associated with a lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.38 - 0.62). There was no significant difference in risk of technical failure, therapeutic failure, complications or 30-day mortality by meta-analysis.   When different types of plastic stents were compared to polyethylene stents, only perflouro alkoxy plastic stents had superior outcomes in one trial. The addition of an anti-reflux valve improved the patency of Teflon stents. Endoscopic metal stents are the intervention of choice at present in patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma.

Three of the trials, which were of high quality, compared plastic stents to surgery. All of the studies were performed in patients with cancer of the distal jaundice due to pancreatic cancer. All studies compared the use of a stent to surgery (metal stents) and all of the stents were compared to a plastic stent (polyethylene stents). We found that metal stents had a lower risk of recurrent blockage of the biliary ducts (recurrence of the cancer) when compared with surgery. There was a trend towards fewer deaths in the first 30 days after the stent was put in place (18%) with the metal stent and a trend in the rate of 30-day mortality (17%). One of the three studies that looked at the effects of metal stenting compared to surgery found that the stented had a higher risk of repeat blockage (17%) than surgery (18%). One study that compared metal stented to surgery reported lower costs and better quality-of-life with the iron stent. Nine of the 29 trials that we found were of good quality. The quality of the evidence for each of the comparisons ranged from very low to high. There is a need for more research to find out the best stent type.', 'This review of trials found that there is a lack of evidence to support the use of metal stents in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

36,"We included five RCTs reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants. Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. Risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment. It was not possible to blind practitioners in all of the included studies; this adds a performance bias that is inherent to the type of intervention studied in our review. Only two studies reported the rate of complications. Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such as haematoma formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence). Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children. Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound on the first attempt success rate. We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters, two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound guidance compared with other types of guidance. No studies reported data about ischaemic damage. We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events. We identified moderate-quality evidence suggesting that ultrasound guidance for radial artery cannulation improves first and second attempt success rates and decreases the rate of complications as compared with palpation or Doppler auditory assistance. The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.","We included five randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants.

We included five randomised trials with 444 catheter-assisted cathests. We were able to combine the results of four of the five studies, which were of good quality. The results of the other two were of low- or very-low- or unclear- quality, and we could not tell if the results were influenced by the type of expertise of the practitioners. We could not be sure that the results would be the same for the first time, but we found that there was a greater chance of success at the first try with ultrasound guidance in infants. We are uncertain about the effect of the first first-tamponment of catheting on complications. The quality of the evidence was moderate for all outcomes. The main limitations of the included studies were the small number of participants and the small numbers of events reported.', 'We found five RCTs (involving 444 arterial cannulations) that compared the first-time-use of ultrasound guidance for radial artery cannulation with other techniques in paediatric patients.

We found that the use of a device to guide the blood flow through the arterial line results in better first- and second-treatment success rates and decreases the rate of complications when compared with other methods of anaesthesia such as palpation or Doppler ears. This may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom angioplasty (i.e. the insertion of a tube into the chest) is more painful than in adults.

37,"We included one small RCT (80 male student participants conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009) and three ITS studies (general population studies in Canadian provinces conducted in the 1970s and 80s). The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men exposed to movies with a high-alcohol content (mean difference (MD) -0.65 drinks; 95% CI -1.2, -0.07; p value = 0.03, very-low-quality evidence). Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol drank less (MD -0.73 drinks; 95% CI -1.30, -0.16; p value = 0.01, very-low-quality evidence). Outcomes were assessed immediately after the end of the intervention (lasting 1.5 hours), so no follow-up data were available. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to a serious risk of bias, serious indirectness of the included population and serious level of imprecision. Two of the ITS studies evaluated the implementation of an advertising ban and one study evaluated the lifting of such a ban. Each of the three ITS studies evaluated a different type of ban (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period. The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of the two studies that evaluated the implementation of a ban showed an overall mean non-significant increase in beer consumption in the general population of 1.10% following the ban (95% CI -5.26, 7.47; p value = 0.43; I2 = 83%, very-low-quality evidence). This finding is consistent with an increase, no difference, or a decrease in alcohol consumption.

The ITS (80 males) found no difference in the amount of high- or low-calm drinks that they drank. The three ITS studies were also inconclusive, and each of the three studies was of very low- or very low quality. The two ITS studies that compared a ban on all forms (total or part) of alcohol ads with a ban of only a small amount of alcohol (part of a ban) found a small increase in the number of people who drank more than the people who did not.

39,"We included one small trial (with data from 34 participants) comparing transcervical amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion. The trial was considered to be at a high risk of bias overall, due to small numbers, inconsistency in the reporting and lack of information on blinding. Meta-analysis was not possible. Transcervical amnioinfusion was with room temperature saline at 10 mL per minute for 60 minutes, then 3 mL per minute until delivery versus no amnioinfusion. All women received intrauterine pressure catheter, acetaminophen and antibiotics (ampicillin or, if receiving Group B beta streptococcal prophylaxis, penicillin and gentamycin). We did not identify any trials that used transabdominal amnioinfusion. Compared to no amnioinfusion, transcervical amnioinfusion had no clear effect on the incidence of postpartum endometritis (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 7.87; absolute risk 176/1000 (95% CI 34 to 96) versus 118/1000;low-quality evidence). Nor was there a clear effect in the incidence of neonatal infection (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 68.84; absolute risk 0/1000 (95% CI 0 to 0) versus 0/1000; low-quality evidence). The outcome of perinatal death or severe morbidity (such as neonatal encephalopathy, intraventricular haemorrhage, admission to intensive/high care) was not reported in the included trial. In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, the rate of caesarean section was the same in both groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.83; absolute risk 294/1000 (95% CI 103 to 832) versus 294/1000; low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the duration of maternal antibiotic treatment between the amnioinfusion and no amnioinfusion control group (mean difference (MD) 16 hours, 95% CI -1.75 to 33.75); nor in the duration of hospitalisation (MD 3.00 hours, 95% CI -15.49 to 21.49). The study did not report any information about how many babies had a low Apgar score at five minutes after birth. Women in the amnioinfusion group had a lower temperature at delivery compared to women in the control group (MD -0.38°C, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.02) but this outcome was not pre-specified in the protocol for this review. The majority of this review's secondary outcomes were not reported in the included study. There is insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the effectiveness of using transcervical amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis and to assess the safety of this intervention or women’s satisfaction. We did not identify any trials that used transabdominal amnioinfusion. The evidence in this review can neither support nor refute the use of transcervical amnioinfusion outside of clinical trials. We included one small study that reported on a limited number of outcomes of interest in this review. The numbers included in this review are too small for meaningful assessment of substantive outcomes, where reported. For those outcomes we assessed using GRADE (postpartum endometritis, neonatal infection, and caesarean section), we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low - with downgrading decisions based on small numbers and a lack of information on blinding. The included study did not report on this review's other primary outcome (perinatal death or severe morbidity). The reduction in pyrexia, though not a pre-specified outcome of this review, may be of relevance in terms of benefits to the fetus of reduced exposure to heat. We postulate that the temperature reduction found may be a direct cooling effect of amnioinfusion with room temperature fluid, rather than reduction of infection. Larger trials are needed to confirm and extend the findings of the trial reviewed here. These should be randomised controlled trials; participants, women with chorioamnionitis; interventions, amnioinfusion; comparisons, no amnioinfusion; outcomes, maternal and perinatal outcomes including neurodevelopmental measures. Further research is justified to determine possible benefits or risks of amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis, and to investigate possible benefits of reducing temperature in fetuses considered at risk of neurological damage. Research should include randomised trials to examine transcervical or transabdominal amnioinfusion compared with no infusion for chorioamnionitis and examine outcomes listed in the methods of this review.","We found one small randomised controlled trial (with data from 34 women) that compared transcervical amnioinfusion with no treatment. The trial was considered to be at a high risk of bias overall, due to small numbers, inconsistency in the reporting of the reporting and lack of information on blinding. The evidence in this review can neither support nor refute the use of this treatment outside of clinical trials. The number of women included in the trial was too small for meaningful assessment of substantive outcomes, where reported. All women received intrauterine pressure catheter, acetaminophen and antibiotics (ampicillin or, if receiving Group B beta streptococcal prophylaxis, penicillin and gentamycin). We did not identify any trials that used transabdominal amniotic fluid (transfusion through the vagina). The trial had no clear effect on the incidence of postpartum endometritis, neonatal infection or caesarean section. There was no clear difference in the duration of maternal antibiotic treatment, nor in the length of stay in hospital. The study did not report any information about how many babies had a low Apgar score at five minutes after birth.

41,"We included 19 studies that investigated three types of amphetamines: dexamphetamine (10.2 mg/d to 21.8 mg/d), lisdexamfetamine (30 mg/d to 70 mg/d), and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS; 12.5 mg/d to 80 mg/d). These studies enrolled 2521 participants; most were middle-aged (35.3 years), Caucasian males (57.2%), with a combined type of ADHD (78.8%). Eighteen studies were conducted in the USA, and one study was conducted in both Canada and the USA. Ten were multi-site studies. All studies were placebo-controlled, and three also included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine. Most studies had short-term follow-up and a mean study length of 5.3 weeks. We found no studies that had low risk of bias in all domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias’ tool, mainly because amphetamines have powerful subjective effects that may reveal the assigned treatment, but also because we noted attrition bias, and because we could not rule out the possibility of a carry-over effect in studies that used a cross-over design. Sixteen studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, one study was publicly funded, and two studies did not report their funding sources. Amphetamines versus placebo Severity of ADHD symptoms: we found low- to very low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians (SMD −0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.04 to −0.75; 13 studies, 2028 participants) and patients (SMD −0.51, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.28; six studies, 120 participants). Retention: overall, we found low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines did not improve retention in treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; 17 studies, 2323 participants). Adverse events: we found that amphetamines were associated with an increased proportion of patients who withdrew because of adverse events (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.63 to 4.45; 17 studies, 2409 participants). Type of amphetamine: we found differences between amphetamines for the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians. Both lisdexamfetamine (SMD −1.06, 95% CI −1.26 to −0.85; seven studies, 896 participants; low-quality evidence) and MAS (SMD −0.80, 95% CI −0.93 to −0.66; five studies, 1083 participants; low-quality evidence) reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms.

Dose at study completion: different doses of amphetamines did not appear to be associated with differences in efficacy. Type of drug-release formulation: we investigated immediate- and sustained-release formulations but found no differences between them for any outcome. Amphetamines versus other drugs We found no evidence that amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity compared to other drug interventions. Amphetamines improved the severity of ADHD symptoms, as assessed by clinicians or patients, in the short term but did not improve retention to treatment. Amphetamines were associated with higher attrition due to adverse events.

There was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non-complex lesions. In complex lesions, there were no statistically significant differences in re-stenosis rates at six months (RR 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.33) and at one year (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55) in those receiving PTCRA with adjunctive balloon angioplasty (PTCA) (PTCRA/PTCA) compared to those receiving PTCA alone. Morphological characteristics distinguishing complex lesions have not been examined in parallel-arm randomised controlled trials. The evidence for the effectiveness of PTCRA in in-stent re-stenosis is unclear Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA/PTCA did not result in a statistically significant increase in the risk of major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction (MI), emergency cardiac surgery or death) during the in-hospital period (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.90).

In the short-term, we found that when conventional PTCA is available, PTCra appears to be no more or less effective in reopening the narrowed artery. In certain circumstances (e.g. those who are not eligible for heart surgery, those with more complex lesions, or those with lesions that do not need re-insertion of the catheters) PTCAA may be beneficial. However, we do not know if it is better or worse in terms of re-opening the catheter. There is a need for more research in this area.

60,"We included 133 (127 cohort type and 6 case-control) studies involving 844,206 participants. We evaluated a total of seven different prespecified index tests in the 133 studies, as well as 69 non-prespecified, and 32 combinations. For the prespecified index tests, we found six studies for the Mallampati test, 105 for the modified Mallampati test, six for the Wilson risk score, 52 for thyromental distance, 18 for sternomental distance, 34 for the mouth opening test, and 30 for the upper lip bite test. Difficult face mask ventilation was the reference standard in seven studies, difficult laryngoscopy in 92 studies, difficult tracheal intubation in 50 studies, and failed intubation in two studies. Across all studies, we judged the risk of bias to be variable for the different domains; we mostly observed low risk of bias for patient selection, flow and timing, and unclear risk of bias for reference standard and index test. Applicability concerns were generally low for all domains. For difficult laryngoscopy, the summary sensitivity ranged from 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.33; mouth opening test) to 0.67 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.83; upper lip bite test) and the summary specificity ranged from 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.85; modified Mallampati test) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; Wilson risk score). The upper lip bite test for diagnosing difficult laryngoscopy provided the highest sensitivity compared to the other tests (P < 0.001). For difficult tracheal intubation, summary sensitivity ranged from 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.43; thyromental distance) to 0.51 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.61; modified Mallampati test) and the summary specificity ranged from 0.87 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.91; modified Mallampati test) to 0.93 (0.87 to 0.96; mouth opening test). The modified Mallampati test had the highest sensitivity for diagnosing difficult tracheal intubation compared to the other tests (P < 0.001). For difficult face mask ventilation, we could only estimate summary sensitivity (0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.39) and specificity (0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95) for the modified Mallampati test. Bedside airway examination tests, for assessing the physical status of the airway in adults with no apparent anatomical airway abnormalities, are designed as screening tests. Screening tests are expected to have high sensitivities. We found that all investigated index tests had relatively low sensitivities with high variability. In contrast, specificities were consistently and markedly higher than sensitivities across all tests. The standard bedside airway examination tests should be interpreted with caution, as they do not appear to be good screening tests. Among the tests we examined, the upper lip bite test showed the most favourable diagnostic test accuracy properties. Given the paucity of available data, future research is needed to develop tests with high sensitivities to make them useful, and to consider their use for screening difficult face mask ventilation and failed intubation. The 27 studies in 'Studies awaiting classification' may alter the conclusions of the review, once we have assessed them.","We included 133 studies involving 844,206 participants in this review.

For diagnosing the length of the trachea, we judged the summary sensitivity to be 0.24 (CI 0.12 to 0.43) and the summary specificity (P = 0.51) to be 1.51. For identifying the distance of the airway from the nose to the mouth to be less than 1.5 metres, we were able to calculate summary sensitivity of 0.17 (CI 1.05) and P= 0.43 for the test. For the diagnostic tests for identifying tracheas from the mouth, we assessed the summary and specificity as 0.93 (CI 95% CI 1.93 to 0). For the other diagnostic tests, we rated the sensitivity of the tests as 1.9 (CI 2.0) and 2.2 (CI 3.0). For identifying difficult throat incisions, we graded the sensitivity as 2.8 (CI 4.8 to 5.2) and 3.7 (CI 6.0 to 7.8) for each tested test. We rated the specificity as 4.0 (CI 7.0% to 8.0%).

For difficult face mask ventilation, only the', 'We found 133 randomised studies involving 844,206 adults. We found that all of these tests have a high risk of bias (i.e. overestimation of the true effect of the test). For the tests that we looked at, we found that: (1) the \'Mallampati test\' (which is used to assess the condition of the airway) is the most reliable test (diagnosed as difficult laryngoscopy) compared to the other tests; (2) the upper lip bite test (used to determine whether the mouth is closed when a tube is inserted to provide oxygen to the airways); (3) the difficult tracheal intubation test (where the tube is placed into the windpipe); (4) the lower lip test (known as the \'up-to-date test"") is the highest quality of the tests; and (5) the different types of tests (which are used to determine airway closure) are the most useful. For the other three tests (difficult face mask ventilation, sternomental distance, and mouth opening test) we found the most accurate test (according to the Wilson risk score). For these tests, we were able to combine their results (summary) from 0.24 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.43; thyromental distance). For difficult face mask ventilator placement, we had a summary of 0.88 (95%) and a rate of 95% (95%), indicating that the test was accurate (out of 100) for the test. For more than 90% of the patients, the test (up to 30%) was correct (down to 0%) for the other test (difference of 0%). For the studies that looked at the use of bedside airway test, we identified, we did not find that the tests were accurate (summary of 0). For patients with no airway problems, we judged the quality of evidence for the tests to be high (outcomes). For people with airway symptoms, we rated the evidence for these tests as very low (results of 0%), due to the low numbers of patients and poor study designs.', 'We included 133 studies involving 8,206 participants. We found that all the tests had relatively low sensitivity, which means that they are less accurate than we would expect. We also found that the tests were not very accurate in identifying difficult face mask ventilation, difficult laryngoscopy, difficult tracheal intubation, and failed intubations. We did not find any studies that looked at the use of the tests to identify difficult tracings. We identified that the upper lip bite test was the most accurate test for diagnosing difficult traceal intutation, but it was not as accurate as the other tests. We could not find studies that tested the tests for identifying difficult tracental intubes, difficult face masks, or failed intubes. We judged the risk of bias in the studies to be variable, and we mostly observed low risk of biased studies for patient selection, flow and timing, and unclear risk of biases for reference standard and index tests. The studies were generally of good quality. We concluded that the studies were of low to moderate quality.', 'We included 133 studies involving 844,206 participants. We found seven different tests in the 133 studies, as well as 69 non-prespecified, and 32 combinations of tests. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries and in different types of patients. Difficult face mask ventilation was the reference standard in seven studies, difficult laryngoscopy in 92 studies, and difficult tracheal intubation in 50 studies.

The tests were designed as screening tests, for assessing the physical status of the airway in adults with no apparent anatomical airway abnormalities. We judged the risk of bias to be variable for the different domains; we mostly observed low risk of systematic bias for patient selection, flow and timing, and unclear risk of statistical bias for reference standard and index test. Applicability concerns were generally low for all domains. Screening tests are expected to have high sensitivities. In contrast, specificities were consistently and markedly higher than sensitivities across all tests. We could only estimate summary sensitivity (0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.39) and specificity (1.0 to 1.2) for difficult face masks ventilation, and we could not estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the tested tests. For difficult larynx examination, we could only assess summary sensitivity of 0.67 (95% CI 0.13 to 0%.33) and the specificity of this test ranged from 0.80 (95%) to 095 (95%). The upper lip test provided the highest sensitivity compared to the other tests (P < 0.001). For difficult tracation, we were able to assess the most favourable diagnostic test accuracy properties (P = 0.01) for the tested test (P= 0.05). The modified Mallamati test had the highest specificity for diagnosing difficult tragation compared to all other tests.

63,"Our searches identified two new published studies with classic design, and one new published study with an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design. We included eight studies. Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect. Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)). Substantial benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo, but about 9% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence). Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence). Moderate benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo, but about 11% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence). A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'. NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence). A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin, and concluded there was no difference in effect. Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration, 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain relief after titration were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin daily) or a short down-titration to placebo for 13 or 26 weeks. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. Of those randomised, 40% had MTR with pregabalin and 20% with placebo (high quality evidence). The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. MTR had no imputation concerns. The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events. Specific adverse events were more common with pregabalin than placebo, in particular dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema, with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence). Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (very low quality evidence). Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin than placebo only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design. Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with pregabalin than placebo, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence). Pregabalin 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo) with moderate or severe pain due to fibromyalgia.

We found that people were more likely to have good pain relief (at least 50% reduction in pain intensity) with a 300 to 600 mg dose than with a placebo (14% more), and about 9% more with a 600 mg dosage (22% to 24%). Side effects (such as dizziness, somnolence (sleepiness), weight gain, and oedema (swelling) were about 10% more likely with the 600 mg than with the placebo (10% more). Withdrawals due to any reason were about 6% more frequent with the 500 mg dose, but were about 2% more common with the 300 mg dose (high quality evidence).

Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration, 687 participants randomised) had an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design, in which those with good pain relief after titration were randomly allocated to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg preregabalin daily, or a short down-titration to placebo for 13 or 26 weeks) or to continuing to take placebo for 12 or 13 weeks. One small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily or once-daily treatment, and concluded there was no difference in effect. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very high. We found that the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction after at least 12 weeks' stable treatment) was increased by about 14% of participants with placebo, but by about 9% more with the 600 mg dose (high quality evidence). Substantial benefit was experienced by about 28% of people with placebo and by about 11% more people with the 300 to 600mg dose. The number of people experiencing moderate benefit increased by at least 30% (moderate quality evidence) by 12 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events. Specific adverse events (dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema) were more common with the 450 mg dose than with placebo. Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo. Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with the 400 mg dose, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high-quality evidence). Withdrawal due to side effects were about 2% more frequent with the 1000 mg dose compared to the 300 mg dose. Serious side effects did not change between active and placebo (very low quality evidence), and withdrawals for any reason were about 1% more common in studies of standard design than with studies of 'classic design'. The number needed to harm was about 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined. The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of'very much improved' and'much or very much improved'. NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14. We identified two new published studies with classic design, and one new published study with an EERW design."", 'We searched for studies that compared the effect of pregabalin to a dummy drug (placebo) or to no treatment.

No studies included active comparators. The results showed that pregabsalin 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable side effects for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo) with moderate or severe pain due to fibromyalgia. The degree of pain relief is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function.

No two studies compared the same interventions. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement.

One low-quality trial (68 participants) reported that at three months post-treatment, use of a high-frequency (high-frequency) and high-intensity (ultrasound) treatment regimen increased the chance that a person with a CTS would have short- or long-term symptoms (i.e. pain, pain, and tiredness) compared with a low- or low-level laser therapy regimen. At the same time, we found that adding a treatment called 'trials and splinting' (where light is applied to the skin) to the CTS skin) did not seem to improve symptoms as much as using low- and very low-intensity laser therapy alone. We found no studies that reported any side effects of the treatments. We do not know if there are any harms due to use of ultrasound. More research is needed to find out if the use is safe. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for most of the outcomes. This was due to the risk of bias in some studies, with only two of the 11 studies reporting that the people in the participants knew which treatment they were getting. Also, we did not have enough data to be sure that the results were valid."", 'We included 11 studies including 414 participants in the review. Two studies compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, two compared one ultrasound treatment with one other, two studies used ultrasound as part of a multisystem treatment, and six studies used it in a multi-system treatment. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Italy. The evidence is current to August 2015. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to support the greater benefit of one type of therapeutic ultrasound regimen over another or to support using therapeutic ultrasound as a treatment with greater efficacy compared to other non-surgical interventions for CTS, such as splinting, exercises, and oral drugs. There was no evidence that one type or combination of therapeutic and non-treatments was better than another.

Only two studies reported short-term overall improvement, with mixed results. There were no significant differences between groups receiving different ultrasound treatments or compared to other non-surgical interventions. Adverse effects were not reported, but more data is needed to determine the safety of therapeutic ultrasound.

Two trials compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, two compared one ultrasound regimen with another, and six compared ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention with another non-surgical intervention (for example, exercises and splint). The risk of bias was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only two reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed and six reporting that participants were blinded. Overall, there is insufficient evidence that one therapeutic ultrasound regimen is more efficacious than another. Only two studies reported the primary outcome of interest, short-term overall improvement (any measure in which patients indicate the intensity of their complaints compared with baseline, for example, global rating of improvement, satisfaction with treatment, within three months post-treatment). One low quality trial with 68 participants found that when compared with placebo at the end of seven weeks treatment, therapeutic ultrasound may increase the chance of experiencing short- term overall improvement when compared to placebo, although losses to follow-up and failure to adjust for the correlation between wrists in participants with bilateral CTS in this study suggest that this data should be interpreted with caution. Another low quality study with 60 participants showed that at three months after treatment therapeutic ultrasound plus splint increased the chance that patients rated their satisfaction with the treatment compared with splint alone. However, there was a potential unit of analysis error. There was insufficient evidence to support the greater benefit of one type of ultrasound regimen over another. Differences between groups receiving different frequencies and intensities of ultrasound, and between ultrasound and other non-Surgical interventions, were generally small and not statistically significant for symptoms, function, and neurophysiologic parameters. No studies reported any adverse effects of therapeutic ultrasound, but this outcome was only measured in three studies. More adverse effects data are required before any firm conclusions can be made. More methodologically rigorous studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound for CTS.']","[2, 3, 0, 1]"

There is moderate quality evidence that with use up to 60 days, the incidence of serious adverse events is not significantly greater than for placebo in the identified trials, but because serious adverse events can be rarely fatal, in some countries prescription of quinine is severely restricted. Evidence from single trials suggests that theophylline combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone, and the effects of xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius are not significantly different to quinine across all outcomes.

We rated the quality of the studies as being of low or very low for most of the outcomes. We judged the quality to be low for cramps of the legs, and very low or low for the rest cramp outcome. We graded the quality as being very low to very low. We were"", 'We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults (aged 18 years or over) who had a leg cramp. We found seven RCTs (involving a total of 406 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. Three of the included RCCs were of pregnant women with leg cramps and four of them were of idiopathic cramps (i.e. rest cramps). We did not find any trials of adults with no-back pain (e.g. knee pain). We found no trials of people with an active muscle cramp (for the most part those with rest pain). The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes (duration of cramps per week, cramp intensity and duration of the cramp) was low or very low. This means that the true result may be close to the truth, but that we are uncertain about the true effect. For the outcome of adverse events, we could not be sure that side-effect rates were lower in the magnesium group than in the placebo group. The number of people who dropped out of the studies due to side-effects was the same as in the control group. We could not determine the number of participants with minor side-side-effects. We classified the risk of minor side effects as similar in frequency to placebo. It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the use of magnesium in the prevention of leg pain due to rest pain.', 'We identified seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers. Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease state-associated cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease). The evidence is current to February 2019. For idiopatic cramps, magnesium did not significantly reduce the number of cramps per week at four weeks. The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group. Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence). The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both. Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo. While we could not determine the numbers of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo. It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramp. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnant-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed.', 'We found seven studies with 406 participants, including 118 who served as their own controls. Three studies focused on pregnant women with leg cramps (202 participants) and four on people with unexplained cramps (322 participants, including controls). Magnesium was compared to a placebo in six studies and to no treatment in one study. For unexplained cramps, mainly in older adults, there were small, non-significant differences in cramp frequency and intensity when comparing magnesium to a placebo. There was also no significant difference in the percentage of people experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate. Cramp duration and intensity']","[3, 2, 1, 0]"
83,"We included one RCT that studied the effects of a six-month, home-based, combined muscle strength and recumbent cycle ergometry training program versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA.

87,"This review includes 29 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2210), although not all reported relevant or useable data. All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition biases and at high risk for biases associated with blinding. We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect. We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD, computer app or game) and technique feedback devices. Differences between interventions, populations and outcome measures limited quantitative analyses, particularly for exacerbations, adverse events, unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider and absenteeism from work or school. Enhanced inhaler technique education and multi-media training improved technique in most studies immediately after the intervention and at follow-up, although the variety of checklists used meant that this was difficult to assess reliably. For both adults and children, how and when inhaler technique was assessed appeared to affect whether inhaler technique improved and by how much. Analyses of the numbers of people who demonstrated correct or 'good enough' technique were generally more useful than checklist scores. Adult studies of enhanced education showed benefit when this metric was used at 2 to 26 weeks' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 13.65; 258 participants; three studies; 31 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 69 (95% CI 45 to 86) in the education group; moderate-quality evidence). A similar result was seen in studies looking at feedback devices at four weeks' follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.87 to 12.33; 97 participants; one study; 51 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 83 (95% CI 66 to 93) in the feedback group; low-quality evidence). However, the benefit of multi-media training for adults even immediately after the intervention was uncertain (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 5.50; 164 participants; two studies; I² = 49%; 30 per 100 in the control group with correct technique compared with 47 (95% CI 26 to 70) in the multi-media group; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence tended to be less clear for children, usually because results were based on fewer and smaller studies. Some studies did not report exacerbations in a way that allowed meta-analysis; others provided inconclusive results. Inhaler technique interventions provided some benefit for asthma control and quality of life but generally did not lead to consistent or important clinical benefits for adults or children.

The duration of the studies ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most of the people in the RCTs had asthma, and the duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 weeks. The evidence is up-to-date as of 4 February 2019. Most studies were conducted in high-income and low-income countries, and most were of high or unclear risk of bias (i.e. high risk of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms). We found that most of the interventions provided some short-term improvement in lung function, although not all of them were of long-term benefit. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) was the most common type of drug used to help patients change their inhaler technique. We found no evidence about harms. Some studies did not report on flare-ups (flare-ups), which could be used to assess the severity of asthma exacerbations; others did not provide this information. We rated the quality of the evidence for most studies as low or very low. This was due to limitations in the way some studies were designed and performed, and in the methods used in some studies.', 'This review analyzed 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2210 participants with asthma. The trials focused on three types of inhaler training: face-to-face sessions, multimedia training (e.g., DVDs, apps, games), and technique feedback devices. The studies had varying follow-up periods, ranging from 2 to 26 weeks. Most of the evidence was considered low quality due to biases and imprecision in the estimates of effect.

We found 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We considered most of the evidence to be of low or unclear quality. Most studies were at low or uncertain risk of bias, which means that we are not sure how the results would be calculated. We were able to combine the results of three studies, which showed that people who had an enhanced face to face training with a multidioded inhaler session and multi-media-delivered inhaler treatment improved their inhaler techniques. However, the studies were too different from each other to be sure that this result would be valid. We also found that people with asthma who had multi- media-delivering inhaler therapy improved their technique more than people who received face-to-face training alone. We could not tell whether this was important for people with more severe asthma. We did find that people in the multi-medialysis group improved more than those in the control group. We are uncertain whether multi-modialysis training is beneficial for adults. We do know that multi-digital inhaler technology is useful for adults, but we are uncertain about its effect on children. We have no information about harms. We rated the quality of the studies as low or moderate for most outcomes. This means that our confidence in the results is limited.

The majority had inflammatory arthritis and most had had a history of having a flare up of rheumatoid arthritis. The studies were carried- out in rheumatology clinics, both in or out of hospitals. The trials aimed to prevent job loss and work absenteement by a range of ways: first, by assessing work change or adaptations, and second, by giving advice and/or guidance to workers on how to change their work. The duration of the interventions varied from two 1.5-hour to six- to eight one to two-hour sessions over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months, to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one study). The results of the studies suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes.

The others studied POPs, cOCs versus POPs or LNGs, or both. Results were not consistent across the 11 trials. We found six trials with moderate quality evidence and sufficient outcome data. The sensitivity analysis included six trials that compared different methods of birth control with each other or with no method. Five trials indicated no differences between groups for breastfeeding duration. Of the six trials, five indicated no significant differences in breast milk content between groups, and the other five did not show any significant difference. We did not find any evidence that any particular method was better than another for any of the outcomes.","['In 2014, we found seven new randomised trials for a new total of 11.82 women. Four of the trials looked at pills (pills and an etonogestrel implant), and three of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). We found two trials of progestin-only pills (POPs) and a LNG-releterium implant. The quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four trials of pills or IUDs. The evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method. For breast milk volume, two of eight trials (1482 women) showed a negative effect on lactation. One trial (124 women) reported a positive effect on breast milk. The other four trials (124 participants) showed no difference between groups. A COC study showed a reduction in lactation in the placebo group but did not report on breastfeeding duration. Another trial showed a lower percentage of the LNG+IUS group breastfeeding at 75 days compared to the nonhormonal IUD group. In one trial, the COC group had a lower rate of breastfeeding at one year than the control group. Of four trials that looked at infant growth, three (involving three types of pills) did not show a difference. One study showed greater weight gain in the etonic implant group compared to no method but less with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 to 12 weeks. The others studied pills, pills, and LNGs. Results were not consistent across the 11 trials. The overall were of low or very low risk of bias.', 'In 2014, we added 7 trials, totaling 11.

Older studies often had unclear results. Most trials found no significant differences in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth. Exceptions were mainly in older studies.

For breast milk weight gain, one showed greater weight gain (grams) for the implant versus no method for six weeks but less compared with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) from 6 to 12 weeks. Of four trials that assessed infant growth, three indicated no difference between groups. One showed more weight gain in the implant group but less in the DMPA group. Of six trials with moderate quality evidence and sufficient outcome data, five trials indicated no significant differences in the insertion time of the implant. Five trials showed no difference in the duration of breastfeeding duration between groups in insertion times, but did not show any significant difference between the groups in breastfeeding volume or weight gain. The evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method. The quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials of COC or POPs. Of the remaining four trials, the quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of women included in the studies and the small numbers of women. The results were not consistent across the 11 trials.', 'We found 11 randomised controlled studies that compared different methods of birth-stopping pills, birth-pills, and birth-control pills with each each each with a dummy pill. We found two trials of pills with progestins and two of pills without progestin. We also found three trials of birth control pills with a levonorgestre-re releasing intra-steroid system (LNG) that is a device that releases hormone hormones. We did not find any trials of other birth-controlling drugs. We looked at the effects of birth and birth control on breast milk volume, breast milk content, or growth. We included studies that looked at birth-birth-control use in the mother, her breast, or both. We only found studies that were of good quality. We could not tell if the birth-bump pills, the LNG, or the birth control pill had an effect. We were not sure if birth-prostagens were more or less likely to be given birth-controlled pills. We had to be able to tell if birth and breast-bumping pills or birth-prefertals had an impact on breast and breast milk volumes. We wanted to know if birth or birth control use had an influence on the length of time a woman breast-fed, the breast-milk content, and the number of babies that were born. We tried to find studies that had been done for at least three months. We wrote to researchers to find out if birth control methods had an important effect on breast or breast milk. We searched for studies published before 1985 and found six studies that included 1482 women. We added seven studies that we could include in the review.

We did not find any studies that looked at the use of home-based care for children with acute or chronic illness. We found that home care does not seem to reduce the need for the child to be cared for in the hospital, or the rate of children who need to be readmitted to hospital. However, there is a reduction in the length of time the child needs to be in hospital when home care is provided. This may be due to parents not knowing when or how to care for their child. We do not know if home care reduces the child's need for care in hospital. We are not able to draw any conclusions about the cost of home care as it was not assessed in any of the seven studies. Further research is needed to find out if home based care is a good way to treat children with a range of health problems."", ""We searched for studies that compared the use of home-based nursing care for sick children with an acute or long-term illness to a standard of care provided by a nurse or midwife.

We were not sure if home care had an impact on the health of the children. The studies did not show that home-care had an effect in reducing the length of stay in the hospital. We also found that parents' and children's views on home care were better, and that there was a greater parental and child's overall increased parental and family-centre-based level of satisfaction.

102,"The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies. The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. 1. ICM versus standard care When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34,low-quality evidence). Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79, low-quality evidence). For the outcome adverse events, the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51, low-quality evidence). In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low-quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0, very low-quality evidence). 2. ICM versus non-ICM When ICM was compared with non-ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate-quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.21, moderate-quality evidence) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.05, moderate-quality evidence) compared to non-ICM. Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95,low-quality evidence) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84, low-quality evidence). Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non-ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74, very low-quality evidence). 3. Fidelity to ACT Within the meta-regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient -0.36, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline hospital use' variable coefficient -0.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10). Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07, P = 0.0027). Based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness. Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care. It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illnesses in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years). Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital. However, it is unclear what overall gain ICM provides on top of a less formal non-ICM approach. We do not think that more trials comparing current ICM with standard care or non-ICM are justified, however we currently know of no review comparing non-ICM with standard care, and this should be undertaken.","The evidence is current to January 2016. We included 40 studies with 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM compared with standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. We found that ICM probably makes little or no difference in reducing the average number of days spent in hospital per month or in the number of admissions to hospital compared to standard care. Similarly, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low-quality evidence.

ICM vs. non-ICM:', 'We searched for evidence on 15 January 2016 and found 40 studies that compared ICM versus standard care, and ICM compared to non-ICM. The evidence is current to February 2016. The studies included 7524 people with severe mental illness. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA. The results showed that ICM may reduce the number of days spent in hospital and may improve social functioning. It also may reduce adverse events and the number leaving the study early. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for the outcomes adverse events, social functioning, and death by suicide. The overall quality of evidence was very low to moderate for the outcome service use. The main limitations of the included studies were poor reporting of study methods and a lack of information about the types of people who were included in the studies. The review found that ICm is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with mental illness, including reducing the number and severity of hospitalisations, and improving social functioning and adverse events. However, the quality of this evidence is very low. The most important finding is that ICMs are more likely to be successful than non- ICMs in reducing the time spent in the hospital and improving the quality and quantity of care.', 'We searched for all randomised trials that compared ICM with non-ICM in adults with schizophrenia.

All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. Box model training versus no training: The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22). Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88). Three trials reported movement distance but could not be meta-analysed as they were not in a format for meta-analysis. There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction. Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65). There was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons (reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training; box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; and single incision versus multiport box model training). There were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons (box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; single incision versus multiport box model training; Z-maze box training versus U-maze box training).

106,"We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence). Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions. A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models.

Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital with face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (about 0.52 g/week). Thus, these studies showed that the effects of these interventions were broadly the same as those of those that did not. None of the interventions caused any harm. We did not find any studies that looked at whether any harm was caused by the interventions. The BCTs of 'Wanting to change' interventions, which are aimed at changing behaviour, were the most commonly used in the studies. In a multivariable model, we found that people using a BCT were more likely to drink up to three (three) more drinks per week more than those not taking a beta-blocker.

Two interventions were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct interventions were tested only by one RCT. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India. The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care; or school-based interventions provided to all participants. These two groups of studies were considered separately. Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. Although there was heterogeneity between studies there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results. We were unable to extract data from all studies in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis. There was moderate quality evidence family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing smoking when compared to a no intervention control. Nine studies (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data. The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention arms (risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.84). Most of these studies used intensive interventions. Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide. Two studies in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17). Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention only. Of the three studies with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). The other five studies with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis. One RCT also compared a family intervention to a school 'good behaviour' intervention and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388). No studies identified any adverse effects of intervention. There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based interventions can have a positive effect on preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There were more studies of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention, than there were for other compairsons. The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school interventions. Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old. Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting).

There was a wide range of interventions. Most studies looked at interventions targeted at the child, and in particular at the parent. There was some low- to middle-income country (Bangalore, Nepal, Nepal) and some high-income (Zanzibar, Bangladesh) country (Cochrane, Kenya, Pakistan) country.

Due to inadequate data, we were unable to rate the quality of the evidence for two studies: one in children with sickle cell disease (low risk of bias), and another in low birth weight neonates with underlying respiratory disorders (high risk of bias). In HIV-infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 1.29, I2 statistic = 47%, P value = 0.21). There was no significant effect on mortality with co-trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis (RR 0.82, 0.46 to 1.46, I2 statistic = 76%, P value = 0.58); however, analysis of one study that used co-trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.85, P value = 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the rates of hospital admission per child-year of follow-up with co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in one study (P value = 0.01).

We could not combine data from one of the trials (140 participants) which showed that patients had less pain on a scale of 1 to 10 with nitrous sulfate at various time points on the first postoperative day compared with those who had carbon dioxide sulphate. Four trials (69 participants) and one trial (75 participants) showed that there were no major adverse events in the group of patients who had a room air inhaler. One trial (70 participants) suggested that room air inhaled air may be better than the air air group. The quality of the current evidence is very low. There is a need for more research on this topic. The evidence is up-to-date as of 4 February 2019.', 'We analyzed nine studies with 519 participants, comparing different gases for pneumoperitoneum: nitrous oxide, helium, and room air versus carbon dioxide.

None of the trials was at low risk of bias. Four trials randomised participants to helium (69 participants) or carbon dioxide (75 participants) and one trial involving 33 participants did not state the number of participants in each group. The trials were conducted in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Three trials (100 participants) compared room air to nitrous gas (100 people) and three trials (96 people) compared carbon dioxide to room air. One trial (76 people) tested room air versus room air under standard pressure (70 people). The trial was at unclear risk of biased. The quality of the current evidence is very low. We could not combine data from two trials (140 participants) which individually showed lower pain scores (a difference of about one visual analogue score on a scale of 1 to 10 with lower numbers indicating less pain) with room air at various time points on the first postoperative day, and this was rated asvery low quality evidence. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of room air on cardiopulmonary complications or surgical morbidity. There were no serious adverse events related to either room air or carbon air (three studies; 196 participants). There were three serious side effects (subcutaneous emphysema) related to helium. The evidence from one trial of small sample size suggests that room air may decrease hospital costs in people undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The trial did not report on the effects on quality of life, pain, or complications. The safety of nitrous, helium, and room air has yet to be established. Further trials on this topic are needed, and should compare various gases (i.e. nitrogen, argon, nitrogen, and nitrogen) with carbon dioxide under standard air pressure. The results of the present review should be interpreted with caution due to the very low quality of evidence.']","[3, 2, 0, 1]"

The participants in the study received oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) for six weeks and were followed up to six months. Compared to the placebo group, the vitamin D group had significantly higher levels of vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels at eight weeks, at 16 weeks, and at 24 weeks. However, the difference was significant at both 16 weeks and 24 weeks and the quality of the evidence for this outcome was moderate. There was no significant difference of adverse events (tingling of lips or hands) between vitamin D and placebo groups, but this result was based on low quality evidence. Regarding the frequency of pain, the participants receiving vitamin D had significantly fewer pain days compared to those receiving placebo, but again, the evidence was of low quality. Furthermore, the review included physical functioning PedsQL scores which was reported as absolute change from baseline. The vitamin D groups had a lower (worse) health-related quality of life score than the placebo groups but this difference was not significant. The quality of evidence was low. The evidence is up to date as of September 2014. We included only one low-quality clinical study which had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data. Therefore, we consider that the evidence is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice.

118,"This review includes only one RCT, funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship. This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause, and compared two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). Children were allocated randomly to one of the two treatments. Treatments were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia. Speech pathology students delivered the treatments in the English language. Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy. Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only. A number of cases in each cohort had recommenced usual treatment by their speech and language pathologist between one month and four months post-treatment (NDP-3: 9/13 participants; ReST: 9/13 participants). Hence, maintenance of treatment effects to four months post-treatment could not be analysed without significant potential bias, and thus this time point was not included for further analysis in this review. We judged all core outcome domains to be low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified. Both the NDP-3 and ReST therapies demonstrated improvement at one month post-treatment. For three outcomes the effect was marginally greater for NDP-3 than ReST: accuracy of production on treated words (NDP-3 mean difference (MD) = 36.0, ReST MD = 33.9; absolute MD = 2.1 between groups); speech production consistency, measured by 25 real words repeated three times using the inconsistency subtest of the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) test (NDP-3 MD = 11.1, ReST MD = 10.9; absolute MD = 0.2 between groups); and accuracy of connected speech, assessed by imitated word accuracy in connected speech of at least three word combinations (NDP-3 MD = 14.3, ReST MD = 11.5; absolute MD = 2.8 between groups). ReST (MD = 18.3) demonstrated a marginally greater effect than NDP-3 (MD = 18.2) for accuracy of production on non-treated words at one month post-treatment (absolute MD = 0.1 between groups). The study did not assess the outcome of functional communication. There is limited evidence that, when delivered intensively, both NDP-3 and ReST may effect improvement in word accuracy in 4- to 12-year-old children with CAS, measured by the accuracy of production on treated and non-treated words, speech production consistency and the accuracy of connected speech. The study did not measure functional communication. No formal analyses were conducted to compare NDP-3 and ReST by the original study authors, hence one treatment cannot be reliably advocated over the other. We are also unable to say whether either treatment is better than no treatment or treatment as usual. No evidence currently exists to support the effectiveness of other treatments for children aged 4 to 12 years with idiopathic CAS without other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders.

The other three studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo. We judged these three studies to be at a mixture of low or unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting. One study conducted in the US in adults studied pyrimethamine-trisulfapyrimidine for eight weeks; one study conducted in the UK in children and adults evaluated pyrimethamine for four weeks; and one study conducted in Brazil in adults investigated trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months. In the last study, all participants had active retinochoroiditis and were treated with antibiotics for 45 days prior to randomisation to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus placebo. Only the study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole over 12 months, in participants with healed lesions, reported the effect of treatment on visual acuity.

Intramedullary nails may have advantages over fixed angle plates for some unstable trochanteric fractures, but further studies are needed.', 'This text discusses a study of 43 trials involving mainly older people with hip fractures. The study compared different treatments and found that the Gamma nail had a higher risk of complications and reoperations than the sliding hip screw (SHS). The intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) also had more complications than the SHS, but similar results for other factors. The proximal femoral nail (PFN) showed no major differences compared to the SHS.

There was no description of concealment of the randomization sequence in two studies. All three studies reported on mortality, and deaths occurred in two of the studies. There were no clear evidence of a difference in mortality between treatment groups. Out of the 123 people randomized and treated, six people died; the causes of death were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, mediastinitis, and septic shock. Among people randomized to surgery, there were reductions in pneumonia, chest deformity, tracheostomy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of intensive care unit stay. Duration of mechanical support, length of stay in the intensive care department, and hospital stay were measured in the three studies. Due to differences in reporting, we could not combine the results and have listed them separately. Chest pain, chest tightness, bodily pain, and adverse effects were each measured in one study. There is some evidence from three small studies that showed surgical treatment was preferable to nonsurgical management in reducing pneumonia, heart deformity and tracheastomy, and duration of intensive-care unit stay, and the length of ICU stay. Further well-designed studies with a sufficient sample size are required to confirm these results and to detect possible surgical effects on mortality.']","[2, 1, 0, 3]"
127,"Fifty trials (19 RCTs and 31 before-and-after studies) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of cerivastatin in 12,877 participants who had their LDL cholesterol measured. The participants were of any age with and without cardiovascular disease and the trials studied cerivastatin effects within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks. Cerivastatin 0.025 mg/day to 0.8 mg/day caused LDL cholesterol decreases of 11.0% to 40.8%, total cholesterol decreases of 8.0% to 28.8% and triglyceride decreases of 9.0% to 21.4%. We judged the certainty of evidence for these effects to be high. Log dose-response data over doses of 2.5 mg to 80 mg revealed strong linear dose-related effects on LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides. When compared to fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing LDL cholesterol; 233-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 18-fold more potent than atorvastatin and six-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing total cholesterol; and 125-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 11-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 13-fold more potent than rosuvastatin at reducing triglycerides. There was no dose-related effect of cerivastatin on HDL cholesterol, but overall cerivastatin increased HDL cholesterol by 5%. There was a high risk of bias for the outcome withdrawals due to adverse effects, but a low risk of bias for the lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not different between cerivastatin and placebo in 11 of 19 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.74). The LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride lowering effect of cerivastatin was linearly dependent on dose. Cerivastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin in reducing LDL cholesterol, and 233-fold greater potency than fluvastatin, 18-fold greater potency than atorvastatin and six-fold greater potency than rosuvastatin at reducing total cholesterol.

The studies were of short-term treatment (three to 12 weeks). The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United Kingdom. The evidence is current to August 2015. The results of the trials showed that cerivastatin was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin, 20-fold stronger than atorvastin and 5.5-fold better than rosuvastarin in reducing LDL cholesterol. The effect of cerivASTatin on total cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides was similar to that of fluvastsatin, but the effect of the drug on the LDL cholesterol was different. The effects of cervastatatin on HDL cholesterol were similar to those of fluvasculin and rosuventatin.

Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD -0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02; I2 = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants: MD -0.04 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 31%), and three (6 studies, 417 participants: MD -0.05 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10; I2 = 68%) compared to control. Serious adverse events occurred in four patients receiving remote ischaemic preconditioning by iliac clamping.

However, this result is based on only one small trial with a low risk of systematic error (ie, the true effect is likely to be close to the truth, but the true result is not true) and should therefore be viewed with caution. Adverse events were not significantly more frequent with one or the other treatment.

In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality (random-effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow-up and within 30 days of follow-up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality to the longest follow-up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow-up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference -0.06 days, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses. As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery.

We were able to combine the data from seven of these trials and found that a LPD diet reduces the rate of decline in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 0.1 ml/min/month (95% CI -0.1 to 0.3) in the LPD group. For type 2 diabetic, one of the trials showed a very small decrease in the rates of decline of GFR in the protein-restricted group and a second found a similar decline in both the intervention and control groups. One of the studies found that the actual protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 g/kg/day. One trial found that there was a slight decrease in GFR with LPD diets. We did not find any data on the effects of LPDs on health-related quality of life and costs. The results of this review show that cutting down on the amount of protein in our food may slow down the risk of kidney failure. However, further longer-term research is necessary.', 'This text discusses 12 studies, including nine RCTs and three before-and-after studies, on the effects of low protein diets (LPDs) on kidney function and mortality. The results suggest that LPDs may slightly slow down kidney disease progression, but not significantly. There is limited data on the impact of LPDs on quality of life and costs. More long-term research is needed for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients. A six-month trial of protein restriction could be considered, with continuation only for those who respond best. Additionally, trials on different types of protein are needed.', 'We found twelve studies that compared protein restriction with no protein restriction. The results show that reducing protein intake appears to slightly slow the rate of kidney failure but not statistically significant so. The level of the protein intake in the diet varied from 1.1 g/kg/d (1.1 ml/min/month) to 1.7 g/m2 (1 g)/day. We found no data on the effects of protein restriction on health-related quality of life and costs. The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. The evidence is up to date as of April 2014.']","[1, 2, 0, 3]"

For patients with severe brain injury, we were able to combine the results of all trials and conclude that the group-based approach (group-based treatment) was the best way to treat patients with acute brain injury.

In the executive factor Z score, the difference in least squares mean change from baseline at week 12 was 0·27 (0·01 to 0·53; p=0·042).There was no effect on cognition on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or ADAS-cog scales. One participant in the active group developed neurological symptoms (impaired visual acuity and colour vision) which resolved on cessation of treatment and were possibly attributable to the drug.

The second trial was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild dementia. There were no significant differences in cognition on the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) composite or memory between placebo and PBT-2 in the least squares average of the two components of the neuropsychological test, but there was a significant improvement in executive function.

140,"We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children. Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class (odds ratio (OR) 8.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.95 to 18.72; 4 trials, 282 participants), to walk 48 metres further in 6MWD (95% CI 40 to 56; 8 trials, 880 participants), and were 22% less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.68; 8 trials, 1119 participants) compared to placebo (high-certainty evidence). The number needed to treat to prevent one additional death was 32 participants. There was an increased risk of adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, especially headache (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.92; 5 trials, 848 participants), gastrointestinal upset (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.48; 5 trials, 848 participants), flushing (OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.83 to 9.26; 3 trials, 748 participants), and muscle aches and joint pains (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.99; 4 trials, 792 participants). Data comparing PDE5 inhibitors to placebo whilst on other PAH-specific therapy were limited by the small number of included trials. Those PAH participants on PDE5 inhibitors plus combination therapy walked 19.66 metres further in six minutes (95% CI 9 to 30; 4 trials, 509 participants) compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). There were limited trials comparing PDE5 inhibitors directly with other PAH-specific therapy (endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs)). Those on PDE5 inhibitors walked 49 metres further than on ERAs (95% CI 4 to 95; 2 trials, 36 participants) (low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in WHO functional class or mortality across both treatments. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to left-heart disease (PH-LHD). The quality of data were low due to imprecision and inconsistency across trials. In those with PH-LHD there were reduced odds of an improvement in WHO functional class using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; 3 trials, 285 participants), and those using PDE5 inhibitors walked 34 metres further compared to placebo (95% CI 23 to 46; 3 trials, 284 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to lung disease/hypoxia, mostly in COPD. Data were of low quality due to imprecision of effect and inconsistency across trials. There was a small improvement of 27 metres in 6MWD using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo in those with PH due to lung disease. There was no evidence of worsening hypoxia using PDE5 inhibitors, although data were limited. Three studies compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo or other PAH-specific therapy in chronic thromboembolic disease. There was no significant difference in any outcomes. Data quality was low due to imprecision of effect and heterogeneity across trials. PDE5 inhibitors appear to have clear beneficial effects in group 1 PAH. Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil are all efficacious in this clinical setting, and clinicians should consider the side-effect profile for each individual when choosing which PDE5 inhibitor to prescribe. While there appears to be some benefit for the use of PDE5 inhibitors in PH-left-heart disease, it is not clear based on the mostly small, short-term studies, which type of left-heart disease stands to benefit. These data suggest possible harm in valvular heart disease. There is no clear benefit for PDE5 inhibitors in pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease or chronic thromboembolic disease. Further research is required into the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension secondary to left-heart disease, and cautious consideration of which subset of these patients may benefit from PDE5 inhibitors. Future trials in PH-LHD should be sufficiently powered, with long-term follow-up, and should include invasive haemodynamic data, WHO functional class, six-minute walk distance, and clinical worsening.","We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review.

CRT was superior to RT in terms of OS (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.89, P = 0.0004), PFS (OR=0.49, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.56, P < 0.0001) and SM (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98, P = 0.03). The superiority of CRT also applied to early and advanced stages (mainly IIIA) separately. Excess SM with RT is due mainly to ST and is apparently caused by greater need for salvage therapy after RT.  CRT was superior to CT in terms of PFS (OR = 77, 95 % CI 0.68 to 0.77, P < 0.0001). OS was better with CRT for early stages only (OR=0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88, P = 0.006). SM risk was higher with CRT (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.89, P = 0.05), although not significant for early stages alone. This effect, also seen in AL and ST separately, was due directly to first-line treatment.  Data were insufficient to compare RT to CT.  EF-RT was superior to IF-RT (each additional to CT in most trials) in terms of PFS (OR=81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95, P = 0.009) but not OS. No significant difference in SM was observed.

The superiority of CRT in terms OS was seen in both early and late stage (I-I-II) HD and in early stage (II-III) HD. The risk of SM was higher with CRT, but not in the early stage. This was due to the need for more salvage treatment. The effect of CRTs was also seen in early and later stage (IV) HD, but this was due mainly to the fact that the early and more recent stage (AL) of HD was the most common stage. The results of this review should be viewed with some care as the results of the trials were not of high quality. The review found that IF- RT was better than CRT for early stage HD, and that it was better for early and early stage of HD. For more recent stages (II to IV), CRT seems to be the best treatment. For early stage, CRT is the best for most early stage and early and advanced stage HD.', 'This review found that CRT seems to be the best treatment for most early stage (I-II) hepatocellular carcinoma and that RT is the best for advanced stage (III to IV). For early stages (II to IV) CRT is better than RT in terms of OS, PFS and SM, but worse than IF-RT. However, more patients need to be treated with CRT than with RT. This is due mainly to the need for more surgery to remove the cancer from the liver.

An Epley manoeuvre alone is effective in just under 80% of patients with typical BPPV. The additional intervention of postural restrictions has a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. The addition of postural restrictions does not expose the majority of patients to risk of harm, does not pose a major inconvenience, and can be routinely discussed and advised. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may be treated with the Epley manoeuvre alone and still expect to be cured in most instances. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoid oscillation during the Epley manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epley manoeuvre. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes.

However, it is important to note that this was done in a small number of patients (10%) and the addition of postural restriction did not lead to a large improvement in the quality of life of those patients. There were no reports of any side effects from the use of posturals. There is not enough data to be sure that applying mastoid oscillation to the neck of patients who wear a cervical collar is a good way to improve their symptoms.', ""The review includes 11 trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restriction in the frequency of conversion of a positive to a negative Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients compared to 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control group converted from a negative to positive test (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 1.22, P = 0.002). No serious adverse effects were reported, however three studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, dizziness and disequilibrium in some patients. No adverse effects of mastoid oscillation were reported. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine application of mastoids oscillation applied during the manoeuvre, or additional steps in an 'augmented' Epleys. Neither treatment is associated with adverse outcomes. Specific patients who experience discomfort due to wearing a cervical collar and inconvenience in sleeping upright may still expect to be cured in most instances.

149,"Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review. No studies were at low risk of bias. The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics. There were three comparison pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, n = 109), (2) polypectomy versus systemic steroids (two studies, n = 87); (3) ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid (one study, n = 35). All participants also received topical steroids but doses and types were the same between the treatment arms of each study, except for the study using antibiotics. In that study, the medical treatment arm had higher doses than the surgical arm. In two of the studies, the authors failed to report the outcomes of interest. Although there were important differences in the types of treatments and comparisons used in these studies, the results were similar. Primary outcomes: symptom scores and quality of life scores There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) failed to find a difference in generic health-related quality of life scores. The quality of this evidence is low or very low. Endoscopic scores and other secondary outcomes Two studies reported endoscopic scores. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a large, significant effect size in the surgical group, with a mean difference (MD) in score of -1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to -1.22, n = 95) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no polyposis, 3 = severe polyposis).

151,"Eleven studies involving 3060 randomly assigned participants were included in this review. The quality of evidence is hampered by risk of bias. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.48, six studies, 2712 participants) and increased clinical progression (one year: risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, five studies, 2067 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.45, six studies, 2373 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25, three studies, 1336 participants), as well as treatment failure (one year: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38, four studies, 1539 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.52, five studies, 1845 participants; two years: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.24, two studies, 808 participants), compared with medical or surgical castration. The quality of evidence for overall survival, clinical progression and treatment failure was rated as moderate according to GRADE. Predefined subgroup analyses showed that use of non-steroidal antiandrogens, compared with castration, was less favourable for overall survival, clinical progression (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) and treatment failure (at one year, 70 weeks, two years) in men with metastatic disease. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens also increased the risk for treatment discontinuation due to adverse events (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.94, eight studies, 1559 participants), including events such as breast pain (RR 22.97, 95% CI 14.79 to 35.67, eight studies, 2670 participants), gynaecomastia (RR 8.43, 95% CI 3.19 to 22.28, nine studies, 2774 participants) and asthenia (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.31, five studies, 2073 participants).

The quality of evidence for breast pain, gynaecomastia and hot flashes was rated as moderate according to GRADE. The effects of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear. Currently available evidence suggests that use of non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy compared with medical or surgical castration monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer is less effective in terms of overall survival, clinical progression, treatment failure and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Evidence quality was rated as moderate according to GRADE. Further research is likely to have an important impact on results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer treated with non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy. However, we believe that research is likely not necessary on non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Only high-quality, randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up should be conducted. If further research is planned to investigate biochemical progression, studies with standardised follow-up schedules using measurements of prostate-specific antigen based on current guidelines should be conducted.","We identified 11 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) involving 3060 men with metastatic prostate cancer.

The risk of treatment discontinuation due to side effects was increased. The quality of evidence was moderate for overall survival, clinical progression and treatment failure. Evidence quality was rated as moderate for other adverse events, such as hot flashes, haemorrhage (blood in the urine), nocturia (night sweats), fatigue, fatigue and loss of interest in sex.

We also found that men who used non-estoidal drugs have more adverse events, such as breast pain, gynaecomastia (joint pain) and hot thrush (eight studies, 2670 men), haemorrhage (two studies, 546 men), tiredness (one large study, 480 men), loss of sex drive (one small study, 51 men), weight gain (one medium size study, 49 men), and urinary frequency (one trial, 480 participants). The quality of evidence for the primary outcome (overall survival) was low due to risk of bias (i.e. overestimation of the true effect of the drug) and imprecision due to imprecise results). For the secondary outcomes (over-treatments due to side-effects) we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate.', 'This review included 11 studies with 3060 participants and found that non-steroidal antiandrogens were less effective than medical or surgical castration for advanced prostate cancer. The evidence quality was moderate, and the treatment had more side effects and increased the risk of treatment discontinuation. The effects on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression were unclear. Further research may impact results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer, but it may not be necessary for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Future studies should be high-quality, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up and standardized measurements.', 'We searched for evidence on 11 studies involving 3060 men with metastatic prostate cancer. The evidence is current to September 2015. The review found that men with advanced prostate cancer treated with non-steroidal antiandrogen monotherapy were less likely to live for longer than those who received medical or surgical castration alone. The risk of dying from prostate cancer was increased by about one-third when non-stimulant antiandrogens were used compared with castration. The use of non-sertraline antiandrogens also increased the risk of treatment discontinuation due to side effects, including breast pain, gynaecomastia (a condition in which the lining of the womb is affected by cancer), fatigue, loss of sexual interest and urinary frequency. The quality of evidence was moderate for overall survival, clinical progression and treatment failure. The effect of nonsteroidal drugs on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression was unclear. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution because the quality of the evidence is limited and the number of studies is small. Further research is likely to have an important impact on results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancers treated with antiandrous drugs. However, we believe that research is unlikely to be necessary on non-estrogen antiandrodrogens for men with this group of men.']","[1, 2, 0, 3]"
152,"Eight eligible trials were identified. We excluded a trial because the randomisation had failed to produce comparable groups.The eligible trials included 600,000 women in the analyses in the age range 39 to 74 years. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.83). The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.87).  We found that breast cancer mortality was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The trials with adequate randomisation did not find an effect of screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer, after 10 years (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10) or on all-cause mortality after 13 years (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.03). Total numbers of lumpectomies and mastectomies were significantly larger in the screened groups (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.42), as were number of mastectomies (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32). The use of radiotherapy was similarly increased whereas there was no difference in the use of chemotherapy (data available in only two trials). If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. To help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. Because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.","We found eight randomised controlled trials that included 600,000 women in the analyses in the age range 39 to 74 years.

We found eight trials that met our inclusion criteria. The trials were carried- out in the 1980s and involved 600,000 women in the analyses. The evidence is current to January 2015. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years. Four trials with suboptimal randomisation showed a significant reduction. The overall quality of the evidence was low. The trial with adequate risk of bias found that breast cancer deaths was an unreliable outcome that was biased in favour of screening, mainly because of differential misclassification of cause of death. The four trials with inadequate risk of biased results showed a statistically important reduction in total cancer mortality. The seven trials with sufficient risk of suboptimum randomisation found a statistically large reduction in the total cancer deaths. The RR for all seven trials combined was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.87). The trials with insufficient risk of random error found no effect of screening on total cancer or on all- cause mortality. We also found that the number of women who had cancer was larger in the screened groups. The use of radiotherapy was similarly increased whereas there was no difference in the use of chemotherapy. The number of breast cancers was larger and the use for cancer treatment was higher in the women who received screening. The quality of evidence was very low.

We did not find one RCT that compared the risk of death from breast cancer to death from any cause. The risk of breast cancer death at 13 years was 20% in the screened groups and 30% in those who did not, but the quality of the evidence was low. The number of women who had a mastectomy (mastectomy) and lumpectomy (an open surgery to remove part of the breast) was similar in screened and non-scheduled groups, as were the rates of cancer spread to the chest and other parts of the body (mastectomies and lumouromies). The use of chemotherapy (drugs used to treat cancer) was increased in both groups. If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer deaths by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for each 1000 women screened, 10 women will be missed and more than 200 women will suffer from some or all of the symptoms for years.

154,"In total, 24 trials were included, but only 16 (10,114 women) had analysable data.

Four of the 29 studies were at low risk of systematic error (ie, there were too few participants in each group for us to be able to draw the true result). Most studies in this review were small and at a high or uncertain risk of reporting their methods. It is not clear whether the risk of surgical wound infection (SSI) is reduced with wound dressing (w wound exposure or any dressing) or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others (or both) in reducing the rate of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, providing pain-free pain relief to patients, or making it easier to remove from the wound. There was limited and low or very low confidence in the evidence for most of the outcomes (scarring, scarring and ease of removal). There was very low or low certainty in the results of the analyses for some of the other outcomes (e.g. quality of life, cost of dressing, quality of the wound, cosmetic outcomes such as how well the wound wounds heal, how well they heal, and if they heal).

However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh.

The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies varied from low to high risk of bias. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant. Therefore, according to the 'Summary of findings' tables, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low. Based on the short-term results, glue may reduce postoperative chronic pain and not simultaneously increase the recurrence rate, compared with sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernia repair.

We did not find any difference between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay, length or recurrence. We investigated adverse events. We were unable to draw any clear conclusions regarding the use or lack of use of synthetic glue. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The included studies were of poor quality. The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies varied from low to high risk of biased. Two studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and the allocation sequence of one trial was not concealed. Nearly half of the included trials either did not provide adequate information or had high risk bias regarding blinding processes. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant. Therefore, according to the 'Summary of findings' tables, the quality of evidence for the outcomes is moderate to very low.

Glue may therefore be a sensible alternative to sutured mesh fixation for mesh fixings in Lichtens. Larger"", ""We found 12 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1932 participants that compared glue with sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein hernia repair. We found that glue was superior to suture regarding duration of the operation, recurrence of hernia, haematoma, and recovery time to daily activities. However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh. The reduction of chronic pain in the glue group was reduced by 37% (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91; 10 studies, 1418 participants, low-quality evidence) compared with the suture group. Subgroup analysis of included studies using lightweight mesh showed a significant benefit from the fixation with glue compared with suture. Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups. We also investigated adverse events. For superficial wound infection pooled analyses showed no significant difference between glue and suture for mesh/deep infection. For seroma (a postoperative swelling caused by fluid) and persisting numbness, six trials involving 1009 participants reported postoperative length of stay, resulting in non-significant difference between the groups. Finally, we found no significant differences between the glue and biological glue. Due to the lack of data, it was impossible to draw any distinction between synthetic glue and synthetic glue. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. Therefore, according to the 'Summary of findings' tables, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low. Based on the short-term results, glue may reduce postoperative chronic pain and not simultaneously increase the recurrence rate, compared with both suture and glue. Glue may therefore be a sensible alternative to suture for hernia fixation. Larger trials with longer follow-up and high quality are warranted. The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies varied from low to high. Two studies were quasi-randomised controlled studies and the allocation sequence of one trial was not concealed.

The length of time that the wounds took to heal with glue and suture was about the same as with sutures.

Brivaracetam, when used as add-on therapy for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, is effective in reducing seizure frequency and can aid patients in achieving seizure freedom. However, add-on brivaracetam is associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo. It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included participants with generalised epilepsy. None of the studies included participants under the age of 16, and all studies were of short duration. Consequently, these findings are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

The incidence of treatment withdrawal for any reason, as well as the risk of participants experiencing one or more adverse events, was not significantly different following treatment with briaracetam compared to placebo. However, participants receiving bribaracetam did appear to withdraw from treatment specifically because of adverse events compared with those receiving a placebo. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk. One study failed to provide details on the method used for allocation concealment, and one did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol. Another study did not describe how blinding was maintained, and another noted discrepancies in reporting. It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included patients with generalised epilepsy. Consequently, these findings are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. When used as an add to treatment for patients with drugs-resistant epilepsy, brivar acetam is effective in reducing seizure frequency and can aid patients in achieving seizure freedom, but is associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to side effects compared with placebo. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate to low.', 'We included six studies with 2411 participants. All six studies included adult participants between 16 and 80 years old, and treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. Only one study included people with both focal and generalised onset seizures, while the other 5 trials only included people who had focal onset. The studies were of short-term, and all were of low quality. We found that people who took brivaracetam with their usual treatment were more than twice (50%) more likely to have a 50% or more decrease (50% or greater) in their seizure frequency than those who took a dummy pill (6 studies). They were more (5) than those people who did not take brivaractam (6) and were also more likely (6), than those taking a dummy drug (5 studies), to achieve seizure freedom (6). However, people taking brivar acetam were more likely than those not taking briaracetam to withdraw from treatment because of side effects (6 trials). It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included people whose seizures were generalised (generalised onset). None of the studies included children younger than 16 years old. The evidence is current to August 2015. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of biases. One study failed to provide details on the method used for allocation concealment, and one did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol. One of the included studies did not describe how blinding was maintained, and another noted discrepancies in reporting. We rated the quality of the evidence as moderate for the reduction in seizure frequency, and as low for side effects. The quality of evidence for the incidence of treatment withdrawal for any reason, as well as for the risk of participants experiencing one or more side effects, was not significantly different following treatment with brivarateam compared to placebo. However, participants receiving brivarata were significantly more likely, compared with', 'We found six studies with 2411 participants. All six of the studies were short-term (7 to 16 weeks), and all of them were of short duration (no more than 16 weeks). We found that brivaracetam, when used as an add-on drug to anti-convulsives for people with drug-resistant epilepsy, reduced the number of seizures by 50% or greater and helped them to be free of seizures compared with those who were treated with placebo. However, we found that people who took bribaracetam were more likely to withdraw from treatment due to adverse events than people who were given placebo. It is important to note that only one of the six studies included participants with a generalised (focal) seizure. None of the other five studies included people with focal seizures. All of the participants included in the trials were aged 16 to 80 years old. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of systematic error (i.e. one study failed to provide details on the method used for allocation concealment, and one did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol). One study did not describe how blind the participants were to the treatment they received. One of the trials did not explain how blind people were, and the other two studies did not state how blind they were. In one study, both participants and researchers knew whether they were in the treatment group or the control group. In both trials, participants knew which treatment they were getting. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the main outcomes as low.', 'The review analyzed six trials with 2411 participants, mostly with focal onset seizures and aged 16-80 years. Two studies had low risk of bias, while four had unclear risk. Brivaracetam add-on treatment significantly reduced seizure frequency and increased seizure freedom compared to placebo. However, there was no significant difference in treatment withdrawal or adverse events, except for a higher withdrawal rate due to adverse events with brivaracetam. These findings mainly apply to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Future research should focus on longer-term effects, other seizure types, and other age groups.']","[1, 3, 2, 0]"

The third trial was conducted in the USA and involved 94 adults (aged 18 to 94 years) and compared heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) with standard silicone oil. There were no differences in the number of people who achieved at least 5/200 visual acuity (at the end of one year) or achieved macular attachment (at end of two years) in any of the three treatment groups. Although there were more adverse events in the first group (sulfur hexafluoride gas) than in the second group (silicone oil) at one year, there were no clear differences between the groups at both one year and two years. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for all of the outcomes. Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal detachment, 22 had a catarax (clouding of the eye), four developed a catarract, and two had capsular fibrosis (scarring in the eye). All three trials used a method of masking of people and their surgery. None of the other studies used a masking method. For the first part of the review, we found that all three trials appeared to be free of bias. The evidence for the other outcomes that we looked at was very low to low.']","[1, 0, 3, 2]"
183,"We included five studies (involving 1819 women) in this review. There was a lower risk of composite maternal mortality and severe morbidity for women randomised to receive planned early delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies, 1459 women (evidence graded high)). There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition. Planned early delivery was associated with lower risk of HELLP syndrome (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93, 1628 women; three studies) and severe renal impairment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, 100 women, one study). There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on composite infant mortality and severe morbidity. We observed a high level of heterogeneity between the two studies in this analysis (two studies, 1459 infants, I2 = 87%, Tau2 = 0.98), so we did not pool data in meta-analysis. There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition. Planned early delivery was associated with higher levels of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.18, three studies, 1511 infants), and NICU admission (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40, four studies, 1585 infants). There was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07, 1728 women, four studies, evidence graded moderate), or in the duration of hospital stay for the mother after delivery of the baby (mean difference (MD) -0.16 days, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.15, two studies, 925 women, evidence graded moderate) or for the baby (MD -0.20 days, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.17, one study, 756 infants, evidence graded moderate). Two fairly large, well-designed trials with overall low risk of bias contributed the majority of the evidence. Other studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. No studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation, potentially introducing bias as women and staff would have been aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making. The level of evidence was graded high (composite maternal mortality and morbidity), moderate (caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother, and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby) or low (composite infant mortality and morbidity). Where the evidence was downgraded, it was mostly because the confidence intervals were wide, crossing both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm. For women suffering from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery is associated with less composite maternal morbidity and mortality. There is no clear difference in the composite outcome of infant mortality and severe morbidity; however, this is based on limited data (from two trials) assessing all hypertensive disorders as one group. Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive diseases and the optimal timing of delivery for these conditions. These studies should also include infant and maternal morbidity and mortality outcomes, caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby. An individual patient meta-analysis on the data currently available would provide further information on the outcomes of the different types of hypertensive disease encountered in pregnancy.","We included five randomised controlled trials (involving 1819 women) comparing planned early delivery versus planned late delivery for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy after 34 weeks' gestation.

We did not find any information about the effect on the combined outcomes of the babies (i.e. very low Apgar scores, very high blood pressures, high fever, or very low blood pressure).

The studies were of low risk of bias. The mean follow- up of the trials was from 365 days to 9.13 days. Data for diabetes patients on all-cause mortality, vascular mortality and myocardial infarction were only available for one trial (355 patients). This trial compared ticlosopidine to placebo and did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences for all-causing deaths, vascular deaths or myocardia infarct. Diabetes outcome data for stroke were available in three trials (31% of total diabetes participants). Overall pooling of two (statistically heterogeneous) studies showed no statistically significant reduction in the combination of fatal and non-fatal stroke (359/3194 (11.2%) versus 356/3146 (11%). The results of the pooled analysis of two studies showed that ADP receptor antagonists were no better than aspirin or other antiplatelet drugs for preventing stroke. There were no data available from any of the included trials on peripheral vascular disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events specifically for patients with type 2 diabetes, or costs. The available evidence for ADP-receptor antagonists in patients with diabetic mellitus is limited and most trials do not report outcomes for patients separately. Therefore, recommendations for the use of ADP receptors for the prevention of CVD in patients are based on available evidence from trials including patients with and without diabetes. Trials with diabetes patients and subgroup', 'We searched for all randomised clinical trials on the use of antplatelet drugs (drugs that block blood clotting) for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes. We found eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients. All eight of the trials were at low risk of bias (i.e. low chance of arriving at the wrong conclusions due to bias due to the way the trial was designed and performed). The mean duration of the studies ranged from 365 days to 913 days. Data for all-cause deaths, vascular deaths and myocardial infarction (heart attack or stroke) were available for only one trial (355 patients). This trial compared ticlopidine to placebo and did not show any statistically significant differences for all cause death, vascular death or myocardary infarct (chest pain). Diabetes outcome data were available in three trials (31% of the participants) and we did not find any difference in the risk of stroke (11.2%) versus 11.3%). There were no data available from any of the included studies on blood vessel disease, health-related quality of life, adverse events, or costs.

One trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. A second trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non-invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia which resolved when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased. Non-invasive ventilation may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Non-invasive ventilation, used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease. The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear. These benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment sessions with small numbers of participants. The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear.

A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D3, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo compared with trials using no intervention in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium supplementation compared with trials without calcium; of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men. Vitamin D3 statistically significantly decreased cancer mortality (RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.98); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 44,492 participants; 4 trials). Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (RR 1.17 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.34); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%; 42,876 participants; 4 trials). Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of hypercalcaemia (RR 3.18 (95% CI 1.17 to 8.68); P = 0.02; I2 = 17%; 710 participants; 3 trials). Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care. Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol had no statistically significant beneficial effects on mortality. Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased nephrolithiasis. Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased hypercalcaemia. Because of risks of attrition bias originating from substantial dropout of participants and of outcome reporting bias due to a number of trials not reporting on mortality, as well as a number of other weaknesses in our evidence, further placebo-controlled randomised trials seem warranted.","We identified 159 randomised clinical trials involving 95,286 participants.

The mean age of the people in these trials was 77%. Most of the trials were of good quality. The trials were randomised, which means that the people who are in the trial are not aware of the treatment they are getting. We did not find any evidence that taking a single tablet of either vitamin D, vitamin C or a vitamin E reduced the risk of dying. We were able to combine the results of 56 trials, which showed that people who took a single pill of either Vitamin D3 (or both) had a lower risk of death than people who did not. We could not tell if taking a pill of one form of vitamin C was better than taking a vitamin A, because we could not be sure of this. We are not sure if taking one pill of a single vitamin C reduced the chance of dying, but we could be sure that it did. We do know that people in high risk of cancer who take a single Vitamin D pill have a lower chance than people in low- or middle-risk groups of dying from cancer. We also know that taking one tablet of one vitamin C may reduce the risk that people will die. We have not found any difference in the risk for people who take vitamin D2, but this could be due to chance.

Ninety-four trials reported no deaths, and nine of the trials did not report in which intervention group the death occurred. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most of the participants were middle-aged. Forty-eight of the studies (94,491 healthy participants) were conducted in high-income countries. The mean age of people in each study ranged from 19 to 70 years. The evidence is up-to-date as of 26 November 2015. Nineteen of the 56 trials (19) included people with high levels of vitamin D (at least 20 ng/mL) and in the other eight trials (795 adults) included those with low levels of Vitamin D (12.5% vs 12.7%). Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum (serum) 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. In 19 of these trials, more than 8% of participants had high blood pressure (20%) at the start of the study. In the other 26 trials (26,927 adults) more than 20% of the people had low blood levels (20% vs 22%). Most of them (77%) were healthy. Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol did not increase the risk of death. A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase death, but this finding could be due to bias (i.e. bias due to the way the studies were designed and performed). We did not find any differences in the effect of the vitamin D on mortality in subgroup meta-analyses of studies at low risk of systematic errors (e.g. the use of a placebo tablet) compared with studies using no treatment in the control group; of studies with no intervention in the placebo group; or of studies including both sexes or only men. We found that when we looked at all trials (involving both men and healthy people) we found that Vitamin D decreased the number of people who died from any cause. This means that over five years, one person would have to be treated for one death due to any cause in order to avoid one death. We also found that people with a high blood cell count (hyperglycemia) and a normal blood calcium level (calciferol) did not seem to have a higher risk of dying from any reason than those with a low blood cell dose (11.0% vs 4.4%). Vitamin D does not appear to be harmful. We do not know whether or not vitamin D reduces death from cancer, heart or lung cancer, or whether vitamin D increases death from any causes.

The review found that prostaglandsins did not reduce the need for manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum haemorrhage, need for blood transfusion or the time from injection to placental removal. Side-effects were no different between groups (vomiting, headache, pain and nausea between injection and discharge from the labour ward), with the exception of shivering, which was more frequent in women receiving prostaglanins. We did not obtain any data for the primary outcomes of maternal mortality and the need to add another therapeutic uterotonic. The included studies were poor quality and there is little confidence in the effect estimates; the true effect is likely to be substantially different. We can not make any recommendations about changes to clinical practice. More high-quality research in this area is needed.']","[0, 2, 1, 3]"

206,"Six studies including a total of 2100 participants met the inclusion criteria: we pooled four studies including 792 people in the main efficacy analyses, and presented the results of a cluster implementation study (n = 1213) and an oral steroid tapering study (n = 95) separately. Baseline characteristics relating to asthma severity were variable, but studies generally recruited people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with COPD or severe asthma. One study compared the two types of check-up for oral steroid tapering in severe refractory asthma and we assessed it as a separate question. The studies could not be blinded and dropout was high in four of the six studies, which may have biased the results. We could not say whether more people who had a remote check-up needed oral corticosteroids for an asthma exacerbation than those who were seen face-to-face because the confidence intervals (CIs) were very wide (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.44; 278 participants; one study; low quality evidence). In the face-to-face check-up groups, 21 participants out of 1000 had exacerbations that required oral steroids over three months, compared to 36 (95% CI nine to 139) out of 1000 for the remote check-up group. Exacerbations that needed treatment in the Emergency Department (ED), hospital admission or an unscheduled healthcare visit all happened too infrequently to detect whether remote check-ups are a safe alternative to face-to-face consultations. Serious adverse events were not reported separately from the exacerbation outcomes. There was no difference in asthma control measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or in quality of life measured on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) between remote and face-to-face check-ups. We could rule out significant harm of remote check-ups for these outcomes but we were less confident because these outcomes are more prone to bias from lack of blinding. The larger implementation study that compared two general practice populations demonstrated that offering telephone check-ups and proactively phoning participants increased the number of people with asthma who received a review. However, we do not know whether the additional participants who had a telephone check-up subsequently benefited in asthma outcomes. Current randomised evidence does not demonstrate any important differences between face-to-face and remote asthma check-ups in terms of exacerbations, asthma control or quality of life. There is insufficient information to rule out differences in efficacy, or to say whether or not remote asthma check-ups are a safe alternative to being seen face-to-face.","We included six studies including a total of 2100 participants in this review. Four studies compared the two types of check-up for oral steroid tapering in severe refractory asthma, and one study compared two different types of remote asthma check-ups. The studies generally recruited people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or severe asthma. We could not say whether more people who had a remote check up needed oral corticosteroids for an asthma exacerbation than those who were seen face-to-face because the confidence intervals (CIs) were very wide (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.44; one study; low quality evidence). In one study, 21 people out of 1000 had an asthma flare-up that required oral steroids over three months, compared to 36 (95% CI nine to 139) out of the 1000 for the remote checkup group. Serious adverse events were not reported separately from the exacerbation outcomes. There was no difference in asthma control measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or in quality of life between the two groups of people.

There is insufficient information to rule out differences in efficacy, or to say whether or not remote checked-ups are a safe alternative to being seen face to-face.","['We found six randomised studies with a total of 2100 adults with COPD. Four of the studies compared the use of a remote check-up to face-to-face, and we included the results of the other study with 1213 adults. All of the adults included in the study were adults. Most of them were in their 60s and had milder symptoms of COPD (e.g. shortness of breath, cough, runny nose or runny noses). Most of the people in the control group had slightly more severe asthma. We could not say whether more of those who had a home-based remote check up needed oral corticosteroids for an exacerbation than those who were seen in the hospital. In one study, 21 out of 1000 adults had an acute flare-up of their asthma that required a course of oral steroids, compared to 36 out of 100 adults in the clinic. There was not much difference in other asthma flare-ups or in quality of life between the two groups. There were too few people in each group for us to be able to tell whether remote check ups are a safe alternative to other asthma check-ups. We do not know whether people who have a phone-up are more likely to benefit from this. The quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes was low. The main reason for this was that we could not be sure that people knew which group they were in (i.e. remote or face-based) and it was not clear whether they would be in, or out of, or if they would have been in, the next day.', 'Six studies with 2100 participants were analyzed. The studies focused on people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with severe asthma or COPD. One study compared two types of check-ups for oral steroid tapering in severe asthma. The studies were not blinded, and dropout rates were high in four of the six studies, which may have affected the results. It is unclear if remote check-ups led to more people needing oral corticosteroids for asthma exacerbations compared to face-to-face check-ups due to wide confidence intervals. In face-to-face check-up groups, 21 out of 1000 participants had exacerbations requiring oral steroids', ""We searched for studies that compared face-to-face and remote asthma check-up for people with asthma. We found six studies including a total of 2100 people. Four studies compared the two types of check-ups for people who were taking their asthma medication and one study looked at the two different ways of giving a check- up. We could not say if more people who had remote check- ups had an asthma flare up than those who were seen face to-face. We did not find any evidence that there was a difference in the risk of asthma flare ups or in the number of people who needed oral corticostoids. We were not able, because the studies were not blind, to tell us if there were any serious side-effects. We do not know if people who have a remote check up have a better asthma control than people who are seen face or phone. We are not sure if people with a remote asthma test are more or less well-behaved when they have a check up. The studies did not show that there were differences in the side- effects of the check-down. We can't be sure if there are any serious adverse events when the check up is done from a remote visit. We have not been able, so we do not think there is enough evidence, from randomised studies, to say if there is a difference."", 'Six studies including a total of 2100 participants met the inclusion criteria: we pooled four studies including 792 people in the main efficacy analyses, and presented the results of a cluster implementation study and an oral steroid tapering study separately. The studies could not be blinded and dropout was high in four of the six studies, which may have biased the results. Baseline characteristics relating to asthma severity were variable, but studies generally recruited people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with COPD or severe asthma.

For outpatients (with mild to moderate exacerbations), evidence of low quality suggests that currently available antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk for treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation (RR 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.94; I² = 31%; in absolute terms, reduction in treatment failures from 295 to 212 per 1000 treated participants, 95% CI 165 to 277). Studies providing older antibiotics not in use anymore yielded an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.90; I² = 31%). Evidence of low quality from one trial in outpatients suggested no effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30). One trial reported no effects of antibiotics on re-exacerbations between two and six weeks after treatment initiation. Only one trial (N = 35) reported health-related quality of life but did not show a statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups.

In turn, the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00; I² = 39%). Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality (Peto OR 2.48, 95% CI 0.94 to 6.55).

210,"Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1896 participants were included. Only one study was judged at low risk of bias. Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at high risk of selective reporting bias. Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast. One study (12 participants) found 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes. Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone. Using a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise significantly reduced activity limitation in five of the eight studies reporting this outcome, reduced pain (number of participants with pain at the long term follow-up: 10/35 versus 25/34; risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.68; 2 studies) and improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events (49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; 7 studies). During the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, commencing weight-bearing made a small improvement in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (mean difference in the difference in range of motion compared with the non-fractured side at the long term follow-up 6.17%, 95% CI 0.14 to 12.20; 2 studies). Evidence from one small but potentially biased study (60 participants) showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short-term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. One study found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with cast immobilisation, but another showed using a backslab improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared with using a bandage. Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions following the immobilisation period after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. There was no evidence of effect for stretching or manual therapy in addition to exercise, or exercise compared with usual care. One small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy. There is limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight-bearing and the use of a removable type of immobilisation to allow exercise during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. Because of the potential increased risk of adverse events, the patient's ability to comply with the use of a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise is essential. There is little evidence for rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management and no evidence for stretching, manual therapy or exercise compared to usual care following the immobilisation period. Small, single studies showed that some electrotherapy modalities may be beneficial. More clinical trials that are well-designed and adequately-powered are required to strengthen current evidence.","This review included 28 studies with a total of 1896 participants. Thirty studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. There was little evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast. One study (12 participants) found 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes. In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone. Five studies investigated different rehabilitation interventions after either conservative or surgical orthopaedic management. One small study (14 participants) at a high risk of bias found reduced ankle swelling after non-thermal compared with thermal pulsed shortwave diathermy. Evidence from one small but potentially biased study (60 participants) showed that neurostimulation, an electrotherapy modality, may be beneficial in the short term. There is little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. There were no evidence of effect for stretching or manual therapy in addition to exercise, or exercise compared with usual care. One of the studies found no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion, but another showed that using a backslab (a piece of metal that supports the ankle in place) improved the range of movement compared with using a bandage (a bandage that covers the whole ankle). There was limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight-bearing and use of removable types of immobilisations to allow exercise. Because of the potential increased risk of adverse events, the patient's ability to comply with the treatment of ankle immobilisation to enable controlled exercise is essential. More trials that are well-designed and adequately-powered are required to strengthen current evidence.","['This text discusses 38 studies with 1,896 participants on rehabilitation interventions for ankle fractures. Only one study had a low risk of bias, while many had high risks of selection and reporting bias. Limited evidence showed short-term benefits of using an air-stirrup over other methods and no improvement from hypnosis. Most studies focused on interventions after surgical fixation, with removable immobilization and controlled exercise showing reduced activity limitation, pain, and improved ankle motion. However, this also led to more minor adverse events. Early weight-bearing after surgery showed small improvements in ankle motion. There was little evidence on the best type of support or immobilization,', 'This review of trials found that early movement of the ankle (before the ankle is fixed) can help to improve the range of motion and pain, but there is little evidence that it is better than usual care. There is some evidence that early weight-bearing (when the ankle has been fixed) may help, but more research is needed. There was no clear evidence that any type of support (e.g., a brace, traction, or traction) is best. There were no trials that looked at stretching, manual therapy or exercise. There are some studies that suggest that some types of immobilisation, such as a non-heat-sealing type, may be helpful. There may be some studies where a device is placed on the ankle to allow the ankle and foot to move. There has been little research on the best type of treatment. There have been no trials of interventions to help people with ankle problems to walk and run. There should be more research in this field.', 'This is an update of a previous Cochrane review. The evidence is up-to-date as of 22 February 2015. We found 38 studies with a total of 1896 adults. The age range of the adults ranged from 18 to 65 years and the mean age of the participants ranged from 31 to 44 years. Most of the people in the studies were male. The duration of the interventions ranged from two weeks to three months. The use of an air-stirrup (short-term) was most commonly used to help patients to get out of bed and walk when treated with an orthosis (shoe) or a walking cast. There was some low-risk-of-bias (i.e. bias) in some of the studies. There were a number of different ways in which people were put into the different treatment groups. One of them was a backslab (a bandage) and the other was a non-thermal (non-theral) diathermy (where air is passed through the skin to the ankle). There was a wide range of use of various types of electrotherapy modalities (e.g. stretching, manual therapy) and some non-pharmaceutical (drugs) modities (such as anti-inflammants) in the control group. We did not find any randomised or quasi-randomised trials. There is a need for more research to find out which is the best way to support patients who have had an orthopaedic condition who are unable to walk or wear a brace. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high. Eight studies were judged as having a high risk of bias and over half of the trials were judged to be of low or very low quality.', ""Thirty-eight studies with a total of 1896 participants were included. Only one study was judged at low risk of bias. Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at risk of selective reporting bias. Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. In 10 studies, the use of a removable type of immobilisation combined with exercise was compared with cast immobilisation alone.

In one study no immobilisation improved ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion range of motion compared with a cast, but another study showed using a backslab improved ankle movement compared with using a bandage. There were no studies on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. The use of weight-bearing made a small improvement in ankle movement after surgical fixation. However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events (49/201 versus 20/197; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.56; 7 studies). There is limited evidence supporting early commencement of weight bearing and the using of a removed from the ankle to allow exercise during the period after surgery.

Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotic effects were more mixed, changing over time. Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. More research is needed to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether topical antibiotics may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments. Further trials should clarify the effects of topical antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments.', 'This is an update of a previous Cochrane review, which found that quinolone antibiotics are better than no drug or antiseptics for the cure of CSOM, and better than placebo or no treatment, at the time of aural removal from the aural. Evidence regarding the safety of these drugs was generally weak. Further research is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the results and may change them.']","[3, 0, 1, 2]"

The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention groups. It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group education sessions. Statistically significant improvements in objective severity using the SCORAD clinical tool were recorded for all intervention groups when compared with controls. Improvements in objective severity (intervention minus no intervention) by age group were as follows: age 3 months to 7 years = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.8; age 8 to 12 years = 6.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 11.2; and age 13 to 18 years = 9.9, 95% CI 4.3 to 15.5.

Trifluoperazine was not significantly different from low-potency antipsychotic drugs in terms of response to treatment (trifluoperazine 26%, low-potency drug 27%, 3 RCTs, n = 120, RR 0.96 CI 0.59 to 1.56, moderate quality evidence). There was also no significant difference in acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason (trifluoperazine 20%, low-potency antipsychotics 16%, 3 RCTs, n = 239, RR 1.25, CI 0.72 to 2.17,low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in numbers with at least one adverse effect (trifluoperazine 60%, low-potency antipsychotics 38%, 1 RCT, n = 60, RR 1.60, CI 0.94 to 2.74, moderate quality evidence).

The quality of the studies and evidence was low, so more research is needed to draw conclusions about the relative effects of the two drugs.', 'We searched for all randomised trials that compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotics.

The size of the trials ranged from 20 to 157, and the length of the studies ranged from four to 52 weeks. We were not able to pool the results of all the trials due to the lack of data. Trifluperazine was not more efficacious than low quality antipsychotic drugs in terms of improvement to treatment (26% versus 27%). There was no difference in numbers with at least one side effect (40% versus 38%). However, there was a significantly higher rate of side effects (23% versus 13%) in the group of patients who took trifuoperazine compared with those who took low quality drugs. There was also a significantly greater rate of leaving the studies early due to any reason (20% versus 16%).

220,"We found nine eligible RCTs including 593 infants in total. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants. Meta-analyses, although limited by data quality and availability, suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain (MD −1.36, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.29 g/kg/day), and provide some evidence that responsive feeding reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding (MD −5.53, 95% CI −6.80 to −4.25 days). GRADE assessments indicated low quality of evidence. The importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the duration of hospitalisation.

The study did not report data on measures of health service utilisation or measures of patient outcomes. The second study used a parallel group design undertaken over a three-year period to compare the impact of capitation payments with fee-for-service payments on primary care dentists’ clinical activity.

Both of these two studies were carried- out in the most deprived parts of the country. The study in the latter found that capitation led to an increase in the number of dentists who carried out dental treatments. The capitecure system also led to a change in the way that dentists treated their clients. The authors of the study found that dentist care was improved when the capitecaure was paid for each tooth. The studies did, however, not report on the use of the health service, health care costs, or the impact on patient health. The second study used a parallel-gauge design.

The trials compared analgesia with other analgesics (ketamine, vinydan-ether, and lignocaine), or with another analgesic drug (pudendal nerve block).\xa0In the diazepam group, women were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with the women who were treated with a placebo (sugar pill). In the other three analgesic groups, the pain was assessed by the anaesthesist.\xa0In one of the trials, the anaesthetist (midwives or nurses) gave the women an analgesic (diazepam) at the time of the birth of the baby, just as they were about to deliver the umbilical cord (neck of the womb).\xa0Also, in one trial, women who received the analgesic compared with those who received a placebo were more satisfied that their pain had been relieved.\xa0There were no trials that looked at the effect of analgesia on the death of the mother, or on the health of the newborn baby.\xa0The trials did not report on important outcomes such as whether the babies born to mothers who received analgesia were born with pain that was more than seven times a day (or less than seven at five minutes), or if they had a cord blood arterial pH score of less than 7.2.\xa0This review did not find any particular analgesic agent or method as most effective in providing pain relief for forceps birth.\xa0Further research is needed to find out which analgesic is the most effective.\xa0It will be important that more research is carried out.', 'We included four trials involving 388 women that were judged to be at an unclear-to-high-risk-of-bereft overall.

No studies detailed outcomes beyond 24 weeks. Subgroup analysis showed some potential groups that may benefit more than others; however, further randomised controlled trials are required before this can be the basis for clinical action. Evidence quality was graded according to the GRADE system. Evidence was considered high quality for the incidence of serious adverse events, mortality and time for laboratory parameters to normalise. Evidence was considered moderate for the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities due to potential inconsistencies in data geography and patient benefits according to grouping. Evidence was moderate for duration of clinical symptoms (fever, rash) due to potential subjectivity in measurement. Evidence was moderate for length of hospital stay as only one study recorded this outcome. This means that we are reasonably confident that the true effect is close to that estimated in this work. Moderate-quality evidence shows that use of steroids in the acute phase of KD can be associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter duration of hospital stay and a decreased duration of clinical symptoms. High-quality evidence shows reduced inflammatory marker levels. There were insufficient data available regarding incidence of adverse effects attributable to steroids, mortality and long-term (> 1 year) coronary morbidity. Certain groups, including those based in Asia, those with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use, especially with decreasing rates of heart problems, but more tests are needed to answer these questions.

The duration of fever (mean difference (MD) −1.65 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.31 to 0.00; 2 studies; I² = 88%) and the time for laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to normalise (MD −2.80 days and 1.41 days, respectively) and length of hospital stay. Evidence was considered to be of high quality for the incidence of serious side effects, mortality and time taken for laboratory measurements (e.g. ESR and CRP). Evidence was of moderate quality for duration of clinical symptoms (fever, rash) due to potential subjectivity in measurement. There were insufficient data available regarding incidence of adverse effects attributable to steroids, deaths and long-term (> 1 year) coronary morbidity. Certain groups, including those based in Asia, those with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use, especially with decreasing rates of heart problems, but more tests are needed to answer these questions. Evidence presented in this study suggests that treatment with a long course of steroids should be considered for all children diagnosed with KD until further studies are performed. Evidence quality was graded according to the GRADE system.","['We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 922 participants. Trials ranged from 32 to 242 participants. We found that corticosteroids reduced the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities, the duration of fever, time for laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)) to normalise and the length of hospital stay. We also found that steroids reduced the time taken for clinical symptoms (fever, rash, rash) to return to normal. We did not find data on the incidence of adverse effects, mortality and long-term (> 1 year) coronary morbidity. No studies detailed outcomes beyond 24 weeks. Evidence quality was graded according to the GRADE system. Evidence was considered to be of high quality for serious adverse events, mortality, duration of clinical symptoms and time for the laboratory parameters to normalize.

Certain groups, including those based in Asia, those with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use, especially with decreasing rates of heart problems, but more tests are needed to answer these questions. Subgroup analysis showed some potential groups that may benefit more than others; however, further RCTs are required before this can be the basis for clinical action.', 'We searched for all randomised trials that compared the use of corticosteroids in patients with KD up to 24 weeks from age 18 years old. We found 7 studies with 922 participants. We were able to combine the data from all of the 7 trials and found that corticostrops reduced the rate of heart attack or stroke in adults with KD. We did not find any data on death or long-term (more than 1 year) heart attacks or strokes. We also found that children with KD who received a long course of steroids had less duration of fever, a shorter time in hospital and a shorter duration of symptoms. Certain groups, such as those based in Asia, those with higher risk scores, and those with greater risk of heart problems may have greater benefit from steroid use. However, more studies are needed to find out if these groups are more likely to benefit from steroids. We rated the quality of the evidence as high for most of the outcomes. This means that we are reasonably confident that the true effect is close to that found in this review. We downgrades the evidence for serious adverse events, mortality and time for blood tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) to low.', 'This analysis included seven trials with 922 participants. The study found that corticosteroids reduced the risk of coronary artery abnormalities and had no serious side effects or deaths. They also shortened fever duration, improved lab results, and reduced hospital stays. However, more research is needed to determine which groups benefit the most from this treatment. The evidence quality was high for some outcomes and moderate for others. Overall, the study suggests that using steroids in the early stages of Kawasaki Disease can improve health outcomes, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.', 'We found seven trials that compared steroid treatment with placebo or no treatment in 922 children with KD. The trials were conducted in Asia, the USA, Europe, Australia, and the UK. The duration of treatment ranged from one to 24 weeks. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found that corticosteroids reduced the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities and the duration of fever, and reduced the time taken for laboratory tests to normalise. We also found that the length of hospital stay was reduced by about one day. We did not find any evidence that steroids increased the risk of death or serious adverse events. We are reasonably confident that the true effect is close to that estimated in this review. Evidence was of moderate quality for the incidence of serious adverse effects, mortality and time for laboratory parameters to normalify. Evidence quality was graded according to the GRADE system. Evidence showed that the incidence was moderate for the occurrence and duration of coronary arteries abnormalities, duration of clinical symptoms (fever, rash) and length of stay in hospital. Evidence presented in this study suggests that treatment with a long course of steroids should be considered for all children diagnosed with KD until further studies are performed. Evidence shows reduced inflammatory markers (e.g. ERS and CRP) and reduced inflammatory marker levels. There were insufficient data available regarding incidence of adverse effects attributable to steroids, mortality, and long-term coronary morbidity. Certain groups, including those based in Asia and those with higher risk scores, and those receiving longer steroid treatment may have greater benefit from steroid use, especially with decreasing rates of heart problems, but more tests are needed to answer these questions.

Four studies involved comparisons with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video-interaction guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. Samples included women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, and other bias). Four studies were at low risk of bias in four or more domains. Four studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment, and no study blinded participants or personnel to the intervention. Five studies did not provide adequate information for assessment of risk of bias in at least one domain (rated as unclear). Six studies contributed data to the PIP versus control comparisons producing 19 meta-analyses of outcomes measured at post-intervention or follow-up, or both, for the primary outcomes of parental depression (both dichotomous and continuous data); measures of parent-child interaction (i.e. maternal sensitivity, child involvement and parent engagement; infant attachment category (secure, avoidant, disorganised, resistant); attachment change (insecure to secure, stable secure, secure to insecure, stable insecure); infant behaviour and secondary outcomes (e.g. infant cognitive development). The results favoured neither PIP nor control for incidence of parental depression (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.04, 3 studies, 278 participants, low quality evidence) or parent-reported levels of depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.02, 4 studies, 356 participants, low quality evidence). There were improvements favouring PIP in the proportion of infants securely attached at post-intervention (RR 8.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 63.70, 2 studies, 168 participants, very low quality evidence); a reduction in the number of infants with an avoidant attachment style at post-intervention (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); fewer infants with disorganised attachment at post-intervention (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.58, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence); and an increase in the proportion of infants moving from insecure to secure attachment at post-intervention (RR 11.45, 95% CI 3.11 to 42.08, 2 studies, 168 participants, low quality evidence). There were no differences between PIP and control in any of the meta-analyses for the remaining primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes.

None of the remaining meta-analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes. We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression and secure or disorganised infant attachment. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial. The included studies also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes. Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship-based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction.","We included eight studies comprising 846 randomised participants, of which four studies compared PIP with control groups only.

All trials had high risk of systematic error (ie, there were too few participants in each group for us to be certain that one drug is better than the other). There were no differences between the groups in the rates of death, liver failure, or perioperative morbidity. The length of hospital stay was shorter in people in the trimetZidine group than in those in the placebo group (three days shorter) and the mean age of the patients in the methylprednolone group (23.5 years) was higher than in the control group (17 years). We found that there is a high rate of type I and type II errors due to the small sample size in each trial and the risk of bias (i.e. there were only a few patients in each arm). However, the use of these drugs should be restricted to well-designed randomised studies.', 'We identified 15 randomised trials evaluating 11 different pharmacological interventions (methylprednisolone, multivitamin antioxidant infusion, vitamin E infusion, amrinone, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, mannitol, trimetazidine, dextrose, allopurinol, and OKY 046 (a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor)). All trials had high risk of bias. There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality, liver failure, or perioperative morbidity. There was no significant difference in any of the clinically relevant outcomes in the remaining comparisons. Trimetazidine may protect against ischaemia reperfusion injury in elective liver resections performed under vascular occlusion, but this is shown in trials with small sample sizes and high quality of evidence. The use of these drugs should be restricted to well-designed randomised clinical trials before implementing them in clinical practice.', 'We identified 15 randomised trials that evaluated 11 different drugs (methanol, multiv vitamin E, pentoxifylline, mannitol, trimetazid, dextrose, allopurinol, and OKY 046 (a thromboxane A2 synthease inhibitor). All the trials had high risk of bias. There were no differences in the risk of death, liver failure, or per-operable morbidity. Methyl Predniotic, methylprednisolone, and dextroxidine may protect against ischaemia reperfusion injury in elective liver resections performed under vascular occlusion, but this is shown in trials with small sample sizes and high risk-of bias. However, there is a high risk for type I and type II errors because of the few trials included, the small sample size in each trial, and the risk for bias. The use of these drugs should be restricted to well-designed randomised clinical trials before implementing them in clinical practice.']","[0, 2, 1, 3]"
243,"Apart from the remaining 37 studies included from the original review, the search resulted in the inclusion of 24 new studies. In total, we included 61 studies; 46 for prevalence, six for both prevalence and risk factors, and nine not meeting the inclusion criteria, but assessing risk factors. The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence of renal dysfunction included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing. The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies, received treatments, reported outcome measures, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which ranged from 2.4% to 32%. Of these 52 studies, 36 studied a decreased (estimated) GFR, including at least 432 CCS, and found it was present in 0% to 73.7% of participants. One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides and vancomycin in CCS receiving total body irradiation (TBI). Four non-eligible studies assessing a total cohort of CCS, found nephrectomy and (high-dose (HD)) ifosfamide as risk factors for decreased GFR. The majority also reported cisplatin as a risk factor. In addition, two non-eligible studies showed an association of a longer follow-up period with glomerular dysfunction. Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, studied proteinuria, which was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants. Risk factors, analysed by three non-eligible studies, included HD cisplatin, (HD) ifosfamide, TBI, and a combination of nephrectomy and abdominal radiotherapy. However, studies were contradictory and incomparable. Eleven out of 52 studies assessed hypophosphataemia or tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), or both. Prevalence ranged between 0% and 36.8% for hypophosphataemia in 287 participants, and from 0% to 62.5% for impaired TPR in 246 participants. One non-eligible study investigated risk factors for hypophosphataemia, but could not find any association. Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, assessed the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia, which ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%. Both non-eligible studies investigating risk factors identified cisplatin as a risk factor. Carboplatin, nephrectomy and follow-up time were other reported risk factors. The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies). Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and abdominal radiotherapy. A non-eligible study also found long follow-up time as risk factor. Three non-eligible studies showed that a higher body mass index increased the risk of hypertension. Treatment-related risk factors were abdominal radiotherapy and TBI, but studies were inconsistent. Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. Risk of bias was present in all studies. The prevalence of adverse renal effects after treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosfamide, radiation therapy involving the kidney region, nephrectomy, or any combination of these, ranged from 0% to 84% depending on the study population, received treatment combination, reported outcome measure, follow-up duration and methodological quality. With currently available evidence, it was not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the prevalence of, and treatment-related risk factors for, specific adverse renal effects. Future studies should focus on adequate study designs and reporting, including large prospective cohort studies with adequate control groups when possible. In addition, these studies should deploy multivariable risk factor analyses to correct for possible confounding. Next to research concerning known nephrotoxic therapies, exploring nephrotoxicity after new therapeutic agents is advised for future studies. Until more evidence becomes available, CCS should preferably be enrolled into long-term follow-up programmes to monitor their renal function and blood pressure.","We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) investigating the effects of treatment-related risk factors on kidney function in adults with cancer. The evidence is current to January 2015. We included 61 studies in this review. The studies included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing. The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence of renal dysfunction included 13 different risk factors. The risk of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies, received treatments, reported outcome measures, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the incidence of chronic kidney disease, which ranged from 2.4% to 32%. Of these 52, 36 studied a decreased (estimated) GFR, including at least 432 CCS, and found it was present in 0.9% to 73.7% of participants. One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides and vancomycin in CCS receiving total body irradiation (TBI). Four non-eligible studies assessing a total cohort of CCS found nephrectomy and (high-dose (HD) ifosfamide as risk factors for decreased GFR. The majority also reported cisplatin as a risk factor. In addition, two non- eligible studies showed an association of a longer duration of treatment with a longer period of proteinuria, and a higher body mass index (a measure of body weight) as risk factor for high blood pressure. Three non-qualified studies showed that a higher BMI increased the risk of hypertension. Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and abdominal radiotherapy. A non-qualifying study also found long follow up time as a long-term risk factor, and three non-equivalent studies found a higher risk of hypomagnesaemia (low white blood cell counts) as a result of treatment. One non-Qualified study investigated the effect of hypophosphataemia or tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), or both. Prevalence ranged between 0% and 36.8% in 287 participants, and from 62.5% for impaired TPR in 246 participants. However, studies were contradictory and incomparable. Eleven out of the 52 studies assessed low blood phosphate levels in the urine, but could not find any association between the two risk factors, and four non- Qualified studies did not find a relationship between the risk factors and TPR. In conclusion, it was not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the occurrence of, and risk factors associated with, specific adverse kidney effects.","['We searched for all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that assessed the effect of any of these drugs or their use in patients with CCS. We found 24 new studies. In total, we included 61 studies; 46 for treatment with cisplatin, four for carboplatin, one for vancomycin, and 24 for nephrectomy. The studies included 13,327 participants. Risk of bias was present in all studies. The frequency of side effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to variation in the type of cancer, length of the cancer and the duration of the treatment (i.e. the length of time that the cancer was in the blood), the number of people who received the drug, and other drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides) and the age of the patients. Risk factors included low blood pressure (hypophosphataemia), low white blood cell counts (white blood cell count) and low levels of phosphorous in the urine (TPR), which ranged from 13.2% to 28.6%. One study found that the risk of low TPR was twice as high in the group of patients who were treated with aminoliccosides. The risk of high blood pressure ranged from 50% to 50%. Risk factors reported by one of the studies were older age at screening and abdominal cancer treatment. A non-certainty of the results was found for the other risk factor, TBI. We were not able to combine the results of all studies due to inconsistency and imprecision in the results.', 'We searched for studies that compared the risk of kidney disease in people with cancer to the risk factors for this disease. We included studies in any language. We found 61 studies, of whom 52 studies evaluated the prevalence of kidney problems. The studies included 13,327 participants of the interest. The majority of studies were of high quality. We did not find any studies that assessed the risk-benefit profile. The evidence is up to date as of January 2015. The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence were of varied quality. The reasons for this were the diversity of the studies, the different types of cancer, the treatment received, the length of follow-up and the risk factor analyses. The results of the 52 studies that investigated the risk for kidney problems ranged from 0% to 84%. The studies were too different to be combined. The risk of adverse renal effects ranged from 1% to 82%. The risk for adverse renal outcomes ranged from 2% to 32%. The evidence was of moderate quality. One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after treatment with aminoglycosides and vancomycin in people receiving total body irradiation. Four non-eligible studies, including 244 participants, found nephrectomy and (high-dose (HD) ifosfamide) as risk factors. The remaining studies also found cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosofamide, radiation therapy involving the kidney region, neph rectomy, or any combination of these. The number of people with kidney problems varied from 0.5% to 50%. The number with high blood pressure ranged from 10% to 30%. The majority also reported cisplotin as a risk factor. In addition, two non- eligible studies showed an association of a longer follow- up period with glomerulopathy.

Three non-emedical studies showed that a higher body mass index increased the risk of hypertension. A non-editable study also found long follow up time as a risk factor. Both non-medication studies investigating risk factors found a higher risk of proteinuria in participants who were treated with transdermal proteinuria. The risk factors, analysed by three non-educational studies, included HD cisplarin, (HD) ifos famide, TBI, and a combination of kidney transplantation and abdominal radiation therapy. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and differences between the studies.

245,"Our search strategies led to 308 potentially relevant references. From these, we included three studies involving 1999 participants. We judged the overall potential risk of bias as moderate.

Two trials compared standard treatment (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy) with PET-adapted therapy (chemotherapy only) in individuals with early-stage HL and negative PET scans. The study design of the third trial was more complex. Participants with early-stage HL were divided into those with a favourable or unfavourable prognosis. They were then randomised to receive PET-adapted or standard treatment. Following a PET scan, participants were further divided into PET-positive and PET-negative groups. To date, data have been published for the PET-negative arms only, making it possible to perform a meta-analysis including all three trials. Of the 1999 participants included in the three trials only 1480 were analysed. The 519 excluded participants were either PET-positive, or were excluded because they did not match the inclusion criteria. One study reported no deaths. The other two studies reported two deaths in participants receiving PET-adapted therapy and two in participants receiving standard therapy (very-low-quality evidence). Progression-free survival was shorter in participants with PET-adapted therapy (without radiotherapy) than in those receiving standard treatment with radiotherapy (HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.50; P value < 0.0001).

246,"We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome. Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from levonorgestrel COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36).

One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38). Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06).

247,"We considered that seven of the 10 included RCTs had a low risk of bias. However, the results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias as none of the RCTs were able to blind participants to treatment allocation and, while most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self reported. One of the 10 RCTs was only reported as a conference abstract and did not provide sufficient data for the evaluation of bias risk. High-quality evidence from nine trials (549 participants) indicated that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to -0.20) and improved physical function (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.05) immediately after treatment. Pain and physical function were estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no pain or loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 11 points; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and improved physical function by an equivalent of 7 points (95% CI 1 to 12 points; NNTB 6). Only three small studies (183 participants) evaluated quality of life, with overall low quality evidence, with no benefit of exercise demonstrated (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.36). Quality of life was estimated to be 50 points on a norm-based mean (standard deviation (SD)) score of 50 (10) in the general population in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by 0 points. Moderate-quality evidence from seven trials (715 participants) indicated an increased likelihood of withdrawal from the exercise allocation (event rate 6%) compared with the control group (event rate 3%), but this difference was not significant (risk difference 1%; 95% CI -1% to 4%). Of the five studies reporting adverse events, each study reported only one or two events and all were related to increased pain attributed to the exercise programme. The reduction in pain was sustained at least three to six months after ceasing monitored treatment (five RCTs, 391 participants): pain (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.18). Pain was estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no pain) in the control group, the improvement in pain translated to a sustained reduction in pain intensity of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 12 points) compared with the control group (0 to 100 scale). The improvement in physical function was also sustained (five RCTs, 367 participants): physical function (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.16). Physical function was estimated to be 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no loss of physical function) in the control group, the improvement translated to a mean of 7 points (95% CI 4 to 13) compared with the control group. Only five of the 10 RCTs exclusively recruited people with symptomatic hip OA (419 participants). There was no significant difference in pain or physical function outcomes compared with five studies recruiting participants with hip or knee OA (130 participants). Pooling the results of these 10 RCTs demonstrated that land-based therapeutic exercise programmes can reduce pain and improve physical function among people with symptomatic hip OA.","We included 10 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in this review. Nine trials (549 participants) showed that exercise reduced pain and improved physical function immediately after treatment and at least three to six months after the end of treatment compared with the control group.

The age range of the participants ranged from 18 to 65 years, and most of them (9 out of 10) had hip or knee OA. The duration of the interventions ranged from three to six months, and the length of the programmes ranged from four to 12 weeks. Seven of the 10 studies were conducted in the UK, and one study each in the USA, Canada and the USA. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low (for pain) to high (for quality of life). Most of the trials (9/10) were well designed and had a low risk of bias (i.e. none of the studies were able to blind participants to the type of intervention). One study (183 people) did not report any funding source. There was no difference in pain or physical function between people who did or did not do exercise. Quality of life was not assessed in any of the included studies. The number of people who dropped out of the control group (participants who did not take part) was 1% more than in the exercise group (1% to 4%). Of the five people who experienced adverse events, each of them had only one or two adverse events and all were linked to increased pain due to the exercise programme. We found high-certainty evidence from nine trials (549 participants) that people who participated in a land-based treatment programme had less pain and improved the amount of pain (29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (no pain) and physical function (8 points) compared with those who were not able to exercise (4 to 11 points) up to three to five months after the end of treatment (4% to 12 points) (95% CI -0.55 to 10). We found moderate-quality evidence from seven trials (715 people) that the number of participants who dropped-out of the treatment group (up to 4%) was 3% less than for people who were unable to participate in the intervention group (3% to 10%). We found low-risk-of-bias (that is, there was a 1% risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of the way the study was run and performed) from five studies (129 adults) that did not have a high risk of having a bias (that means that the true results are likely to be close to the truth).

All of these admissions occurred in the late laparotomy group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours in the later laparosis group. This trial did not report quality of life or return to work. There was no significant difference in the proportion', 'Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic) (n = 35) or delayed laparoscopy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (N = 40), contributed information to this review. Information on the outcome mortality was available for the 75 participants. There were no deaths in the early group (0/35) (0%) versus 1/40 (2.5%) in the delayed group (P > 0.9999). There was no bile duct injury in either group. The trial did not report quality of life or return to work. The other outcomes were available for 28 participants (28 people in the late group) and 35 participants (35 participants) in the earlier group. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholelectomy (6/35 or 17.1%) compared with 6/35 (0% or 17% in both groups) (P = 0.0743). The proportion of participants who developed serious adverse events was 0/28 (0%). This was significantly lower than in the group of people in which the surgery was delayed (9/40 or 22.5%). In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms. All of these admissions occurred in the later group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours of diagnosis. The duration of the hospital stay was shorter in the first group (1.25 days) than the second group (2 days). The length of time spent in the intensive care unit (HCP) was shorter (14.80 minutes) and there was a shorter operating time (14 minutes). The trial had a high risk of bias. Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that surgery to remove bile from the biliary tract in the immediate post-diagnosis period reduces the morbidity during the waiting period, the length of hospital stay, and the time to perform the surgery. The complications that the participants suffered included pancreatitis (1), empyema of the gallbladder (2), gallbladders perforation (3), acute bilecystitis (4), acute cholangitis (5), obstructive jaundice (6), and recurrent bile colic (requiring hospital visits) (5). This trial was not large enough to be able to confirm or refute these findings. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm the findings of this review, and to determine if the waiting time is shortened further.', 'A single study with 75 participants (average age 43, 65% female) compared early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 24 hours of diagnosis) to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (average wait of 4.2 months). The study had a high risk of bias. No deaths or serious surgery-related adverse events occurred in the early group, while one death and several complications happened in the delayed group during the waiting period. The early group had a significantly lower rate of serious adverse events, shorter hospital stays, and shorter operating times. However, this evidence comes from only one high-bias risk trial', 'We found only one randomised study (involving 75 adults) that compared early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (the first part of the bile duct) with delayed laparoscopically-related laparomystectomy. There were no deaths in either group. The rate of death in the early group was 2.5% lower than in the delayed group (2.5%). There was no serious adverse events related to the surgery in both groups. The complications that the patients suffered included pancreatitis (1), empyema (jaundice), gallbladder perforation (2), cholangitis (3), obstructive jaundice (4), and recurrence of biliary colic (5). In total, 14 people had to be treated in hospital due to the above symptoms. All of these people were operated on within 24 hours in the late group. This study did not report quality of life or the rate of return to work. Based on one high-bias risk (i.e. there was a high chance of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of the way the study was designed and performed) trial, it appears that laparopystectomy performed on the first day of the first week after surgery (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) decreases the morbidity of the surgery, the length of hospital stay, and the time that the surgery takes to do. Further research is required to confirm or refute these findings.']","[3, 1, 0, 2]"

The age range of participants ranged from 18 to 65 years. The duration of the treatments ranged from 3 to 12 weeks, and the length of the interventions ranged from 4 to 20 weeks. The evidence is up-to-date as of 4 February 2019. We found that people with MS who had received treatment for at least 2.5 weeks were more than twice as likely to be able to breathe on their own than those who had not received treatment. There was no difference in the amount of pressure they were able to breath on themselves. However, people who had been trained to breathe with a strength-type (respirative) muscle training device showed a greater improvement in their breathing ability. We were not able to assess quality of life due to the lack of information provided in this review. We rated the quality of the evidence for all of the outcomes as low. This means that we are very uncertain about the results. The quality of evidence for most of the outcome measures was low. The main reason for this was that we did not have a lot of data.', 'We analyzed six studies with 195 participants with MS. Two studies looked at inspiratory muscle training, three at expiratory muscle training, and one at regular breathing exercises. There were no serious side effects reported. We combined data from five studies (137 participants) for both types of muscle training. The results showed that inspiratory muscle training had a significant benefit on predicted maximal inspiratory pressure, but not on maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressure. Expiratory muscle training showed no significant effects. The studies did not report on health-related quality of life. Due to the low number of studies, we could not perform further analyses.', 'We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 195 participants with MS.

We pooled and analysed data of 5 trials (N=137) for both inspiratory and exergetic muscle training, using a fixed-effect model for all but one outcome.

Two studies compared the effects of inspirate muscle training with a threshold device; three studies tested expirate muscle-tracking with a device; one study tested the effects on health- related quality-of- life; and one study compared the effect of breathing exercise with no active control. We found that people with MS who had inspirate or expiratory muscle-brushing with a resistive threshold device had a higher peak inspirate force (maxim inspirate) than people who had no active treatment. The effect of these exercises on the level of inspiration (maximal expirator force) was not clearly different from that of those who had not been given any active treatment, but there was a small but meaningful benefit on the peak expirative force. The impact of these effects on the people's health-based quality- of- life was not clear. We did not find any studies that compared expirated muscle-racking with no exercise. We could not combine the results of the six studies, which were too small to be sure that the effects were the same. We were able to combine the data of 5 studies, with a total of 137 people, and we found that the effect on peak expiral force (expirate force), which was not significantly better than that of no active training, was not different. We are not sure if this effect is sustained. We also found no evidence that expirates had an effect on fatigue. We cannot be sure if the effect is the same for other outcomes, such as the level or quality-life. We rated the quality of the studies as low, which means we are very unsure of the true effect.

Participants had moderate to severe keratoconus pre-operatively and were randomly allocated to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. Only one eye of each participant was treated as part of the trials. The smaller study had 12 month follow-up data for all participants. For the larger study, four DALK surgeries had to be abandoned due to technical failure and visual and refractive outcomes were not measured in these participants. Follow-up length for the remaining 77 participants ranged from 6.8 to 36.4 months, with all 77 followed for at least three months post-suture removal. Details of the randomisation procedure were unavailable for the smaller study and so sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine if the results from this study had affected the overall results of the review. Neither of the included studies reported a difference between groups on any of the measures of post-graft visual achievement, keratometric astigmatism or spherical equivalent. A single case of graft failure in a penetrating keratoplasty was reported. No postoperative graft failures were reported in the DALK group of either study. Instances of graft rejection were reported in both groups, in both studies. The majority of these cases were successfully treated with steroids. The data, which related to all cases in each study - given that the four cases that did not go ahead as planned had already technically failed without presence of rejection - showed that rejection was less likely to occur in DALK (odds ratio (OR): 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.81, GRADE rating: moderate). Results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that inclusion of the Razmju 2011 study did not bias the results with regards to rejection episodes. While sensitivity analysis showed altered results with regards to failure rates, the data available from the Javadi 2010 study alone had a very wide 95% CI, suggesting an imprecise estimate. Therefore, even after removal of the Razmju 2011 data, it is still difficult to draw conclusions regarding superiority of one technique over another with regards to graft failure. DALK was unable to be completed as planned in four cases and in a further three cases, complications during dissection required further intervention. Other adverse events, of varying severity, were reported in both intervention groups with similar frequency.

Evidence that iron supplementation improves cognitive performance in women is uncertain, as studies could not be meta-analysed and individual studies reported conflicting results. Iron supplementation improved maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and appears to reduce symptomatic fatigue. These benefits come at the expense of increased gastrointestinal symptomatic side effects."", 'We searched for all randomised and quasi-randomised studies of iron supplements in women with PCOS. We found 67 trials (from 76 reports), with a total of 8506 women. Most of the trials (10) were well-conducted (low risk of bias) but only 10 were of low or very low risk (high risk of systematic bias) and the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high. Women were less likely to be anaemic at the end of iron treatment than women who were not taking iron (10 studies, 3273 women). Women taking iron had a higher haemoglobin and iron stores (51 studies, 6861 women). We found that women who took iron were more likely to have a lower risk of becoming anaemic (7 studies, 1088 women) than those who did not take iron (7 trials, 7861 participants). We also found that iron increased the amount of iron stored in their blood (7 of 1214 women) compared to those who were taking control (6 trials, 1190 women). However, we did not find an increased risk of having a hard stools/diarrhoea (8 trials, 1036 women) or a loose stools (8 studies, 1214 patients). We did not identify an increase in the rate of side effects from iron supplements (five trials, 521 women). Evidence that iron supplements improve mental health in women is uncertain, as we were not able to pool (meta-analyse) the findings due to variation in results across studies. We did find that taking iron reduces the number of cases of anaemia and iron-deficiency anaemia in the short-term (i.e. anaemia due to lack of iron in the urine) and long-term risk of death (one study, 55 women). The use of iron does not seem to increase the risk of adverse side effects.', 'The study analyzed 67 trials with 8,506 women to examine the effects of iron supplementation. Results showed that iron supplements reduced anemia and iron deficiency, increased hemoglobin levels, and improved exercise performance and fatigue. However, they also caused more gastrointestinal side effects. Only 10 studies had a low risk of bias, and most lacked sufficient details about trial quality. Overall, daily iron supplementation effectively reduces anemia and iron deficiency while improving exercise performance and reducing fatigue, but it may cause gastrointestinal side effects.']","[3, 1, 2, 0]"

We were not able to combine the results of our analyses due to variation in the definition of 'quality of life' and the methods used to assess this in a wide range of studies. We are uncertain as to whether there is a clear difference in men with cancer who are able to reduce their pain when they are on bisophosphonic drugs compared to those who are not on the other side of the prostate cancer (i.e. men who are unable to use analgesics). We are moderately certain that men who have bone metastitis due to prostate cancer will not have more pain than men who do not receive these drugs. However, we are not sure if men with this cancer will have as much pain as men with other cancers that are not cancerous to bone (e.g. colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and oesophageal cancer).

Adverse events were rarely reported and were observed more frequently in patients undergoing HDT + ASCT (mostly infections and haematological toxicity). For patients with relapsed FL, there is some evidence (one trial, N = 70) that HDT + ASCT is advantageous in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; OS: HR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.89). For this trial, no results were reported for TRM, adverse events or secondary cancers. In summary, the currently available evidence suggests a strong PFS benefit for HDT + ASCT compared with chemotherapy or immuno-chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL. No statistically significant differences in terms of OS, TRM and secondary cancers were detected. These effects are confirmed in a subgroup analysis (one trial) adding rituximab to both treatment arms. Further trials evaluating this approach are needed to determine this effect more precisely in the era of rituximab.

However, this result is based on a subgroup analysis of one trial. For this trial, no results were reported for death from any cause or cancer recurred. In summary, we found a strong PFS benefit for high-duration stem cell treatment compared with placebo or no transfusions in the first-time patients with follicle-fibrotic cancer.

For the CMAI, the study reports a Global score (29 items rated on a seven-point scale (1 = never occurs to 7 = occurs several times an hour) and summed to give a total score ranging from 29 to 203) and mean scores (evaluable items (rated on the same 7-point scale) divided by the theoretical total number of items) for the following four domains: Physically Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as pacing (13 items); Verbally Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as repetition (four items); Physically Aggressive Behaviour, such as hitting (nine items); and Verbally Aggressive Behaviour, such as swearing (three items). Four of the five CMAI scales improved in the intervention group (Global: change mean difference (MD) −5.69 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) −9.59 to −1.79; Physically Non-Aggressive: change MD −0.32 points, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.15; Verbally Non-Aggressive: change MD −0.44 points, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.19; and Verbally Aggressive: change MD −0.16 points, 95% CI −0.31 to −0.01). There was no difference in change scores on the Physically Aggressive scale (MD −0.08 points, 95% CI −0.37 to 0.21). Using GRADE guidelines, we rated the quality of this evidence as very low due to high risk of bias and indirectness of the outcome measures. There were no differences in NPI or OS change scores between groups by the end of the study. We also identified one ongoing study. The limited evidence means that uncertainty remains around the effectiveness of de-escalation and the relative efficacy of different techniques. High-quality research on the effectiveness of this intervention is therefore urgently needed.","This review includes just one study of 306 older people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, conducted across 16 nursing homes in France.

Twenty-four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator. In the crossover trial by Sørensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one-week ‘on’ or ‘off’ periods. In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI.

The risk of bias of the trials ranged from 20% to 31% and the risk of systematic error (bias) ranged from 10% to 30%. The quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes ranged from very low to high. There were no deaths in the short-term in any of the groups. There was no difference in the rate of long-term deaths (i.e. six months or more) between the two groups. However, one of the studies (involving 464 patients) reported that there were no short- term deaths in either group. There did not seem to be a difference between the rates of serious side-effects (such as pain, pain due to the gallstones, bleeding from the liver, or failure to be discharged as planned) or in the need to be readmitted to the hospital. No difference was seen in the number of people who needed to be hospitalised for any reason. No differences were seen in quality of life, pain, length of stay in hospital, hospital readmission rate, time to return to normal activity, or the need for hospital readmissions. For all outcomes, we found that laparomy laparopy laparoscope surgery was just as safe as the overnight stay surgery. The evidence for all of the outcome measures was low to very low. The reason for this was that many of the results were imprecise.', 'We found six randomised clinical trials involving a total of 492 participants undergoing day-surgery laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay surgery for symptomatic gallstones. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 28 to 150. The proportion of women in the trials varied between 74% and 84%. The mean or median age of the participants varied between 40 and 47 years. With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short-term mortality. However, the trial stated that there were no deaths in either of the groups. Long-term deaths were not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups (4 trials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day surgery group versus 1/200 (0.5%) in overnight surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09). No significant difference was seen in the number of people requiring hospital readmissions (5 trials; 464 participants; 6/225 (5/239 (2.1%) compared to 5/154 (3.2%) in an overnight stay group) or in the proportion of failed discharge (failure to be discharged as planned) between the groups (3 trials; 290 participants; 5/136 (3/136) in the group undergoing day surgery compared to 3.5% of people undergoing overnight surgery). There were no significant differences in the quality of life of the patients in either group. The two groups did not differ in any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. Pain was similar in both groups. For all outcomes except pain, the accrued information was far less than the diversity-adjusted required information size to exclude random errors. We concluded that there was no difference between the day and overnight surgery groups for the following outcomes: pain, time to return to activity (2 trials, 217 participants; 0.69 cm visual analogue scale score; 1 trial, 74 participants; MD -2.00 days), return to activities of daily living (1 trial, 2.18 to 1.08 days), and return to the workplace (one trial, 474 participants). The quality of the evidence is weak because of the small number of trials and the risk of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance).', 'We looked at six studies with 492 participants comparing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (239 people) and overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy (253 people) for gallstones. The studies had different numbers of participants, ages, and gender ratios. Only one study reported short-term mortality, but no deaths occurred in either group. Long-term mortality was not reported in any study. There were no significant differences in serious side effects, quality of life, pain, time to return to activity, or return to work between the two groups. Hospital readmission rates and failed discharges were also similar between the groups. Overall', 'We identified six randomised clinical trials involving 492 people. The trials compared day surgery versus overnight stay laparoscopical operation for symptopic (surgically active) gallstone-infected patients. The number of people in each of the six trials ranged from 28 to 150. The mean or median age of the people in the trials was 40 to 47 years. The proportion of women in the studies varied between 74% and 84%. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Italy, Japan, and the UK. The evidence is current to August 2015. The review found that day-surgery appears to be as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events between the two groups. There were no significant differences in quality of life between the groups. The quality of the evidence was not significantly different between the studies. There is no significant evidence that day surgery is better than overnight stay for any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. The results of the trials supporting these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). More randomised trials are needed to assess the impact of day-surgical laparoscope cholecopy on the quality of lives of patients.']","[2, 1, 0, 3]"
273,"We included eight studies, involving 2488 participants, two more studies and 415 more participants than the previous version of this review. Studies were of generally good methodological quality; we judged only one study at high risk of bias, due to small size. Two studies used a placebo control and six used 0.04% topical capsaicin as an 'active' placebo to help maintain blinding. Efficacy outcomes were inconsistently reported, resulting in analyses for most outcomes being based on less than complete data. For postherpetic neuralgia, we found four studies (1272 participants). At both 8 and 12 weeks about 10% more participants reported themselves much or very much improved with high-concentration capsaicin than with 'active' placebo; the point estimates of numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) were 8.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3 to 26) at 8 weeks and 7.0 (95% CI 4.6 to 15) at 12 weeks (2 studies, 571 participants; moderate quality evidence). More participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 8-week and 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% and at least 50% with capsaicin than control, with NNT values between 10 and 12 (2 to 4 studies, 571 to 1272 participants; very low quality evidence). For painful HIV-neuropathy, we found two studies (801 participants). One study reported the proportion of participants who were much or very much improved at 12 weeks (27% with high-concentration capsaicin and 10% with 'active' placebo). For both studies, more participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% with capsaicin than control, with an NNT of 11 (very low quality evidence). For peripheral diabetic neuropathy, we found one study (369 participants). It reported about 10% more participants who were much or very much improved at 8 and 12 weeks. One small study of 46 participants with persistent pain following inguinal herniorrhaphy did not show a difference between capsaicin and placebo for pain reduction (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for efficacy outcomes by one to three levels due to sparse data, imprecision, possible effects of imputation methods, and susceptibility to publication bias. Local adverse events were common, but not consistently reported. Serious adverse events were no more common with active treatment (3.5%) than control (3.2%). Adverse event withdrawals did not differ between groups, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were somewhat more common with control than active treatment, based on small numbers of events (six to eight studies, 21 to 67 events; moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to few events). No deaths were judged to be related to study medication. High-concentration topical capsaicin used to treat postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and painful diabetic neuropathy generated more participants with moderate or substantial levels of pain relief than control treatment using a much lower concentration of capsaicin. These results should be interpreted with caution as the quality of the evidence was moderate or very low. The additional proportion who benefited over control was not large, but for those who did obtain high levels of pain relief, there were usually additional improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. High-concentration topical capsaicin is similar in its effects to other therapies for chronic pain.","We included eight studies, involving 2488 participants, two more studies and 415 more participants than the previous version of this review.

Two studies used a placebo control and six were blinded, which means that the people in the control group knew which treatment they were getting. We found four studies (1272 people). The studies were of generally good quality. High-concentration topical capsaicin was used to treat post-herpetic nerve pain, post-HIV-neuropathy, and pain in the legs. High concentration capsaicins produced more pain relief than control groups. The results should be viewed with some caution, as we found that the quality of the studies was very low. The studies did not report on the effects of high- or low-concordance capsaicine. High levels of pain were more common in people with post-Herpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, or painful diabetic nervepathy. High concentrations of capsaicina were used to reduce pain in pain in people who had painful diabetic nerves. High doses of capsicin were used in two studies (571 people) and in one study (369 people). High- or very low-intensity capsaicines produced moderate or substantial pain relief in people suffering from painful diabetic pain. High intensity capsaicinas did not cause serious side effects. The quality of evidence was very limited, as the studies were small and the results were not consistent. We rated the quality as moderate or very limited for pain relief, and very low for side effects, because of small numbers of studies and small numbers. We downgraded the quality because of poor reporting of study results.', 'We found eight studies, involving 2488 adults, and 415 more adults, all of whom had painful HIV-neuropathy. We found that high-concentration topical capsaicin provided more pain relief (at both 8 weeks and 12 weeks) than placebo, with an average 2 to 8-week pain reduction of 10% and a mean of 7%, compared with 2 to 12 weeks with placebo. At the same time, we found that about 10% more adults had at least half of the pain that would be needed to treat the pain, compared with those who had placebo. This was the case for both posthergia (4 studies) and pain following inguinal herniorrhaphy (1 study). There were no deaths. Side-effects were no more common with active treatment (3.5%) than with control (2.2%) (six to eight) (six studies, 21 to 67 events). No deaths were reported.

No differences were found between rTMS and sham rTMS, and no adverse events were reported. However, due to the small sample size and methodological issues, rTMS cannot be considered completely safe. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of rTMS in treating ALS.', 'The purpose of this review was to assess the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of ALS. We found three trials with a total of 50 participants. All three of the trials were of poor quality in terms of the way they were designed and performed. The high rate of attrition in all three trials made it difficult to pool the data. None of the included trials provided detailed data on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) scores at six months follow-up which was pre-assigned as our primary outcome. One of the three randomised, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) included in the review provided data in a suitable form for analysis of our secondary outcome. No difference was seen in the ALS functional rating scale and manual muscle test (MMT) at 12 months in one of the RCTs and six months in the other trials. No adverse events were reported. However, in view of the small sample size, the quality of the evidence and the lack of reporting of the outcomes, we cannot be sure about the safety of treatment with recombinant TMS in ALS. There is a need for more research in this area.', 'We found three randomised controlled trials with a total of 50 participants. All three studies compared rTMS with sham TMS. All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogenous to allow the pooling of the results. Moreover, the high rate of attrition from the trials further increased the risk of bias. The trials did, however, provide some limited data on the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) score, which was pre-assigned as the outcome of our review. One of the trials provided data in a form that could be used for analysis. No difference was seen in the ALSFRS-R score and the ALS manual muscle test (MMT) score at 12 months in this trial. None of the studies reported on any side effects. There is not yet enough evidence to draw any conclusions on the efficacy and side-effects of r tMS. Further studies may be helpful if their potential benefit is weighed against the impact of participation in a randomised clinical trial on people with ALS.']","[1, 0, 2, 3]"

Statins had uncertain effects on progression of CKD. Data for relative effects of intensive cholesterol lowering in people with early stages of kidney disease were sparse. Statins clearly reduced risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and MI in people with CKD who did not have CVD at baseline (primary prevention). Statins consistently lower death and major cardiovascular events by 20% in people with CKD not requiring dialysis.

Adverse events associated with RIC were significantly higher in participants treated with RIC (RR 10.91; 95% CI 2.01 to 59.28; 3 trials, 371 participants, low-quality evidence), but no severe adverse event was attributable to RIC treatment. No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment.

No participants experienced death or cardiovascular events during the period of the studies; and no trial reported haemorrhagic stroke or improvement in neurological, phycological or cognitive impairment. There was no significant difference between RIC and non-RIC for reducing stroke severity as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and the final infarct volume (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.24 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.02 to 0.54; 2 trials, 175 participants, very low quality evidence).

In people with symptomatic arterial stenosis, there was no difference in the incidence of stroke between participants treated with RIC versus those treated without RIC, however the stroke severity was significantly lower in people treated with the RIC compared with those who did not receive RIC for improving the psychological impairment and the cognitive impairment in people with stroke and cerebral small vessel disease. Adverse events were more common in people who received RIC than in those who received non-RIC, but no serious adverse events were reported.

We found seven RCTs involving 735 adults. We analysed the effects of RIC on the prevention of and treatment of ischaemia stroke and carotid stenosis, and we found that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce the rate of stroke severity in those with acute ischaememia stroke. RIC treatment may increase the number of people who will have at least one additional stroke in the short term (up to one year). The rate of adverse events due to RIC was higher in the RIC group than in the group that did not receive RIC, but no severe adverse event was reported. No participants experienced death or heart attack (heart attack or stroke) during the period of the studies. We did not find any RIC-based studies that looked at the effect of Ric on the frequency of haemorrhagic stroke (stroke due to blood clots in a blood vessel). We assessed risk of bias and judged it to be low for six studies and unclear in one study; unclear for four studies; high for two studies; low for three studies; and high for other sources of bias (i.e. bias due to the design of the RCT).

The fourth parallel-group trial showed that eight weeks of treatment with flunisolide (500 mcg/day) was associated with a larger reduction in adenoid size than isotonic saline solution (P < 0.05). The fifth parallel-group trial demonstrated that eight weeks of treatment with fluticasone (400 mcg/day) significantly reduced nasal obstruction symptoms and adenoid size, and adenoidectomy was avoided in 76% of these patients compared with 20% of the patients treated with normal saline (P < 0.05). In contrast, one parallel-group trial did not find a significant improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms nor adenoid size after eight weeks of treatment with beclomethasone (200 mcg/day). Current evidence suggests that intranasal corticosteroids may significantly improve nasal obstruction symptoms in children with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy, and this improvement may be associated with a reduction in adenoid size. The long-term efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in these patients remains to be defined.","Six randomised trials involving a total of 394 patients were included in this review. Five of the six trials demonstrated a significant efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and in reducing adenoid size.

The third parallel-group trial demonstrated that 77.7% of children treated with mometasone (100 mcg a day) for 40 days demonstrated an improvement in nasal obstruction symptom scores and a decrease in the size of the nasal obstruction, such that nasal obstructionectomy could be avoided in 76% of these patients compared with 20% of those treated with normal saline. The fourth parallel-grip trial showed a significant reduction in adenoids size with flunisolide (500 mcg per day) compared with isotonic saline solution. The fifth parallel group trial demonstrated a significantly reduced nasal obstruction (nosebleed) symptom score and adenoidal size, and an adverse event of nasal obstruction was avoided in the fluticasone group compared with the saline group. In contrast, the sixth trial did not find a significant improvement in nose obstruction symptoms nor in the number of children with nasal obstruction size after eight weeks of treatment with a 200 mcg dose (200 mg per day). Based on these results, current evidence suggests that intrinsic steroids may significantly improve nasal obstruction in children with moderate to severe nasal hypertrophy, and that this improvement may be associated with a reduction in size.

Moreover, we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated driving lessons as an intervention.', ""We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 245 adults with a mean age of 31 years. The evidence is up-to-date as of 26 November 2016. The studies were conducted with people who were relatively young and the time after stroke was varied. We found that the use of a driving simulator may improve some aspects of cognition, such as recognition of road signs, but we were not able to find any RCTs that looked at the effects of using on-road drivers' skills after stroke. We did not find any studies that looked into the effect of using the technique in the context of rehabilitation. We do not know whether or not people who have had a stroke will be able to drive after the stroke. It is not clear whether the impairments that cause people to be unable to drive are due to the stroke, or whether they will be due to other factors such as age, gender, or the type of stroke. The quality of the evidence for each of the outcomes ranged from very low to high. The main reason for this was that many of the people in the studies were not blind (i.e. they were not aware of which group they were in), and a high/unclear risk of bias identified in the areas of: quality of life (participants knew which treatment they were getting), and the number of people who dropped out of the study due to withdrawal."", 'We found four studies that involved 245 participants. The studies were conducted with people who were relatively young and the timing after stroke was varied. The interventions included a simulator-based driving programme, a skill-based approach, and a retrain of vision, such as retraining of visual processing, and visual motor skills. We found no clear evidence that the use of a driving simulator improved the scores of people who had a stroke. We did, on the other hand, find that it may have helped people to learn to recognise road signs. There was not clear evidence of an effect on the scores on the test-ride test, which is a test that asks people to take part and then return to the same place on the road, as well. There were no adverse effects. We were not able, at the present, to draw any conclusions on the effects of the intervention on the vision, other aspects of cognition, and on the driving behaviour. We could not find any studies that assessed the effects on the on- road driving skills of people with stroke. The quality of the studies was low or very low. We judged the overall quality of studies to be low for most of our main outcome measures.']","[0, 1, 2, 3]"
315,"Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis.

Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias.

No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more).

Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates.

320,"We included three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years with Down syndrome. Two studies compared parent-mediated interventions versus TAU; the third compared a parent-mediated plus clinician-mediated intervention versus a clinician-mediated intervention alone. Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months. One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home-based sessions over a 13-week period. Another study provided weekly, individual clinic-based or home-based sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours, over a six-month period. The third study provided one 2- to 3-hour group session followed by bi-weekly, individual clinic-based sessions plus once-weekly home-based sessions for 12 weeks. Because of the different study designs and outcome measures used, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. We judged all three studies to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants (not possible due to the nature of the intervention) and blinding of outcome assessors, and at an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. We judged one study to be at unclear risk of selection bias, as authors did not report the methods used to generate the random sequence; at high risk of reporting bias, as they did not report on one assessed outcome; and at high risk of detection bias, as the control group had a cointervention and only parents in the intervention group were made aware of the target words for their children. The sample sizes of each included study were very small, meaning that they are unlikely to be representative of the target population. The findings from the three included studies were inconsistent. Two studies found no differences in expressive or receptive language abilities between the groups, whether measured by direct assessment or parent reports. However, they did find that children in the intervention group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with language targets in certain contexts postintervention, compared to those in the control group; this was not maintained 12 months later. The third study found gains for the intervention group on total-language measures immediately postintervention. One study did not find any differences in parental stress scores between the groups at any time point up to 12 months postintervention. All three studies noted differences in most measures of how the parents talked to and interacted with their children postintervention, and in one study most strategies were maintained in the intervention group at 12 months postintervention. No study reported evidence of language attrition following the intervention in either group, while one study found positive outcomes on children's socialisation skills in the intervention group. One study looked at adherence to the treatment through attendance data, finding that mothers in the intervention group attended seven out of nine group sessions and were present for four home visits. No study measured parental use of the strategies outside of the intervention sessions. A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study. Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA. The remaining study did not specify any funding sources.

This means that we have very little confidence in the results, and further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects of parent-mediated interventions for improving the language and communication of children with Down syndrome. We found only three small studies of very low quality. This review highlights the need for well-designed studies, including RCTs, to evaluate the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions.

327,"We found 17 eligible randomised controlled studies that included term and near-term infants with hypoxia. Ten trials compared iNO versus control (placebo or standard care without iNO) in infants with moderate or severe severity of illness scores (Ninos 1996; Roberts 1996; Wessel 1996; Davidson 1997; Ninos 1997; Mercier 1998; Christou 2000; Clark 2000; INNOVO 2007; Liu 2008). Mercier 1998 compared iNO versus control but allowed back-up treatment with iNO for infants who continued to satisfy the same criteria for severity of illness after two hours. This trial enrolled both preterm and term infants but reported most results separately for the two groups. Ninos 1997 studied only infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. One trial compared iNO versus high-frequency ventilation (Kinsella 1997). Six trials enrolled infants with moderate severity of illness scores (oxygenation index (OI) or alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2)) and randomised them to immediate iNO treatment or iNO treatment only after deterioration to more severe criteria (Barefield 1996; Day 1996; Sadiq 1998; Cornfield 1999; Konduri 2004; Gonzalez 2010). Inhaled nitric oxide appears to have improved outcomes in hypoxaemic term and near-term infants by reducing the incidence of the combined endpoint of death or use of ECMO (high-quality evidence).

The overall quality of evidence for the outcomes was very limited. The findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. The available evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the wide range of outcomes reported. The results of this systematic review are not conclusive. The current evidence is insufficient to determine whether nutrition-specific interventions can reduce low- and moderate-income babies and children who are born into slums or poor urban or periurban areas."", 'We searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at interventions to improve the health of low- and middle-income slums. We included 15 RCTs with a total of 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. The interventions took place in a range of slums or poor ( slum-based) urban or periural (i.e. slums where people live in slums but do not live in them) areas. The evidence is up-to-date as of 19 June 2017. All interventions were aimed at improving health for low-income and poor slum populations. All the interventions were targeted at reducing the risk of low birth weight and low birth height. The intervention was given to pregnant women (three studies), micronutrient or macronutrients (two studies), and nutrition systems strengthening (two trials). All interventions targeted children (one RCT and one controlled before-and-after study). The quality of the evidence was very low to low. The main reason for this was that most of the studies had a high risk of bias, which means that their methods and results are not reliable. The findings of this Cochrane review are based on a wide range of outcomes. We found that all interventions could reduce low-birth weight and high-risk of low blood pressure (low- and very low-certainty) in low-risk populations. However, there was no evidence that any of the intervention was better than no intervention, or that they were better than usual care (standard care). There was also no difference in the length of the babies (18 months or younger) or the length (up to 18 months) between the groups. The overall, the evidence for most interventions was of low to very low quality. The studies included in this review were of low or very low certainty, due to the way they were designed and performed.']","[1, 0, 3, 2]"

333,"We found 22 trials that met our inclusion criteria with a total of over 2310 participants (one study did not report number of participants). The included studies mostly had small numbers of participants (from 4 to 317) and relatively short follow-up periods (4 to 24 weeks). At baseline, six trials included only people with ulcers that were clinically infected; one trial included people with both infected and uninfected ulcers; two trials included people with non-infected ulcers; and the remaining 13 studies did not report infection status. Included studies employed various topical antimicrobial treatments, including antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver, iodides), super-oxidised aqueous solutions, zinc hyaluronate, silver sulphadiazine, tretinoin, pexiganan cream, and chloramine. We performed the following five comparisons based on the included studies: Antimicrobial dressings compared with non-antimicrobial dressings: Pooled data from five trials with a total of 945 participants suggest (based on the average treatment effect from a random-effects model) that more wounds may heal when treated with an antimicrobial dressing than with a non-antimicrobial dressing: risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45. These results correspond to an additional 119 healing events in the antimicrobial-dressing arm per 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 191 more). We consider this low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to risk of bias). The evidence on adverse events or other outcomes was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence, frequently downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Antimicrobial topical treatments (non dressings) compared with non-antimicrobial topical treatments (non dressings): There were four trials with a total of 132 participants in this comparison that contributed variously to the estimates of outcome data. Evidence was generally of low or very low certainty, and the 95% CIs spanned benefit and harm: proportion of wounds healed RR 2.82 (95% CI 0.56 to 14.23; 112 participants; 3 trials; very low-certainty evidence); achieving resolution of infection RR 1.16 (95% CI 0.54 to 2.51; 40 participants; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence); undergoing surgical resection RR 1.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 5.90; 40 participants; 1 trial; low-certainty evidence); and sustaining an adverse event (no events in either arm; 81 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence). Comparison of different topical antimicrobial treatments: We included eight studies with a total of 250 participants, but all of the comparisons were different and no data could be appropriately pooled. Reported outcome data were limited and we are uncertain about the relative effects of antimicrobial topical agents for each of our review outcomes for this comparison, that is wound healing, resolution of infection, surgical resection, and adverse events (all very low-certainty evidence). Topical antimicrobials compared with systemic antibiotics : We included four studies with a total of 937 participants. These studies reported no wound-healing data, and the evidence was uncertain for the relative effects on resolution of infection in infected ulcers and surgical resection (very low certainty). On average, there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events between the compared topical antimicrobial and systemic antibiotics treatments: RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; moderate-certainty evidence - downgraded once for inconsistency). Topical antimicrobial agents compared with growth factor: We included one study with 40 participants. The only review-relevant outcome reported was number of ulcers healed, and these data were uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). The randomised controlled trial data on the effectiveness and safety of topical antimicrobial treatments for diabetic foot ulcers is limited by the availability of relatively few, mostly small, and often poorly designed trials. Based on our systematic review and analysis of the literature, we suggest that: 1) use of an antimicrobial dressing instead of a non-antimicrobial dressing may increase the number of diabetic foot ulcers healed over a medium-term follow-up period (low-certainty evidence); and 2) there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events related to treatment between systemic antibiotics and topical antimicrobial treatments based on the available studies (moderate-certainty evidence). For each of the other outcomes we examined there were either no reported data or the available data left us uncertain as to whether or not there were any differences between the compared treatments. Given the high, and increasing, frequency of diabetic foot wounds, we encourage investigators to undertake properly designed randomised controlled trials in this area to evaluate the effects of topical antimicrobial treatments for both the prevention and the treatment of infection in these wounds and ultimately the effects on wound healing.","We included 22 studies with a total of over 2310 participants (one study did not report number of participants).

We found that more wounds healed when they were dressed with an antimicrobial (antibiotics) dressing than with a non-antimicrobial dressing, and that they had more wound-healing events (51 to 191 more per 1000 patients) than when they had non-infected ulcers (49 to 191 per 1000 participants). We are uncertain about the effects on the risk of adverse events (i.e. pain, pain, and swelling of the skin due to the use of antibiotics) or surgical resection of the wound (1 to 2.5 per 100 patients). We were not able to draw any conclusions about the benefits or harms of any of the antibiotics used in these studies due to too few wounds and too few participants. We are not confident that any of them are better than antibiotics for wound healing, or that they are as good as antibiotics. We do not know which is the best way to dress the wound, or what happens when the wound is dressed with them. We were unable to draw conclusions about whether any antibiotic is better than any other than the other. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for most of the outcomes.

Participants were randomised to either surgery or aspiration and sclerotherapy. All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions. There were no significant differences in clinical cure between the two groups (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.10), however there was significant heterogeneity (I² = 95%). On further investigation one study contributed all of the heterogeneity. This could be due to the agent used or the fact that this is a much older study than the other two studies included in this analysis. When this study was removed from the analysis the heterogeneity was 0% and the result was significant (in favour of surgery). There was a significant increase in recurrence of the disease in those who received surgery compared with surgery. One study reported a non-significant decrease in fever in the surgical group. There was an increased number of infections in the surgery group, however this increase was not statistically significant (4 studies, 275 participants). Three studies reported the frequency of pain in patients receiving surgery was higher than those receiving sclerosant agents but because of different measurement tools used in these studies, we could not combine the results. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies. Only one study reported patient satisfaction at three and six months; there was no significant difference between the groups. There is a great need for rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different types of sclerosing agents, sclerosesant concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles.

All of the studies were small (involving less than 50 patients altogether) and the duration of the trials ranged from three to six months. All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias (i.e. bias due to the way patients were put in the treatment group, or the way the outcomes were reported). We found that there was no difference in the rate of cure between the two groups. There was an increase in the recurrence of the cancer in those who received sclerotherapy compared with surgery. This could be due to either the drug used or the fact that this is a much older study than the other three included in this analysis. One study found that the frequency of pain in the surgery group was higher than the scleromy group but we were not able to pool the results due to variation in the methods used in the studies. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies. Only one study looked at the quality of life of the participants and found that they were no more or no less satisfied than those who did not have treatment. However the recurrences of cancer recurred in both groups. One trial found that those who had surgery recurred at the same rate as patients who had sclerotherapy. There were an increased number of infections in the surgical group but this increase was not significant. Post-surgery side-effects such as well as cost and time to work resumption were less frequent in the anaesthetomy group. There is a great need for more research to be done to find out which is the best way to treat these patients. It is important that the trials have a large sample size and a long duration of follow-up. We recommend that all studies in this area should be published in a well-conducted way. The methods for all studies should be reported in a way that is up to date to date at the end of the trial. The cost-effectiveness of these drugs should be assessed.']","[3, 0, 1, 2]"

341,"We included 21 studies with 2658 randomised participants. All studies assessed the effectiveness of some form of psychological therapy. We found no studies that included physical therapy. Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); the remainder evaluated behaviour therapies, third-wave CBT (mindfulness), psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy. Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list. Five studies compared the intervention to enhanced or structured care. Only one study compared cognitive behavioural therapy with behaviour therapy. Across the 21 studies, the mean number of sessions ranged from one to 13, over a period of one day to nine months. Duration of follow-up varied between two weeks and 24 months. Participants were recruited from various healthcare settings and the open population. Duration of symptoms, reported by nine studies, was at least several years, suggesting most participants had chronic symptoms at baseline. Due to the nature of the intervention, lack of blinding of participants, therapists, and outcome assessors resulted in a high risk of bias on these items for most studies. Eleven studies (52% of studies) reported a loss to follow-up of more than 20%. For other items, most studies were at low risk of bias. Adverse events were seldom reported. For all studies comparing some form of psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list that could be included in the meta-analysis, the psychological therapy resulted in less severe symptoms at end of treatment (SMD -0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.16; 10 studies, 1081 analysed participants). This effect was considered small to medium; heterogeneity was moderate and overall quality of the evidence was low. Compared with usual care, psychological therapies resulted in a 7% higher proportion of drop-outs during treatment (RR acceptability 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 14 studies, 1644 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Removing one outlier study reduced the difference to 5%. Results for the subgroup of studies comparing CBT with usual care were similar to those in the whole group. Five studies (624 analysed participants) assessed symptom severity comparing some psychological therapy with enhanced care, and found no clear evidence of a difference at end of treatment (pooled SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; considerable heterogeneity; low-quality evidence). Five studies (679 participants) showed that psychological therapies were somewhat less acceptable in terms of drop-outs than enhanced care (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; moderate-quality evidence). When all psychological therapies included this review were combined they were superior to usual care or waiting list in terms of reduction of symptom severity, but effect sizes were small. As a single treatment, only CBT has been adequately studied to allow tentative conclusions for practice to be drawn. Compared with usual care or waiting list conditions, CBT reduced somatic symptoms, with a small effect and substantial differences in effects between CBT studies. The effects were durable within and after one year of follow-up. Compared with enhanced or structured care, psychological therapies generally were not more effective for most of the outcomes. Compared with enhanced care, CBT was not more effective. The overall quality of evidence contributing to this review was rated low to moderate. The intervention groups reported no major harms. However, as most studies did not describe adverse events as an explicit outcome measure, this result has to be interpreted with caution. An important issue was that all studies in this review included participants who were willing to receive psychological treatment. In daily practice, there is also a substantial proportion of participants not willing to accept psychological treatments for somatoform disorders or MUPS. It is unclear how large this group is and how this influences the relevance of CBT in clinical practice. The number of studies investigating various treatment modalities (other than CBT) needs to be increased; this is especially relevant for studies concerning physical therapies.

We found no studies that compared CBT with other forms of therapy such as psychodynamic (mindfulness) therapy.

We were not able to combine the data from all of the included studies due to inconsistencies in the methods used in some of the analyses. However, we were able to do this in part due to the quality of the trials. We are satisfied that people in the control groups were not aware of whether they were on CBT or on the other side (i.e. the 'usual care' group). We are not sure if this would have had an impact on our results. We do not know if people who were in the treatment groups were aware of which group they were in. We have not been able to draw any firm conclusions about whether CBT is better than other types of therapy for Soma, MUPS, or both. This is because most studies did not report on this topic.

Evidence synthesis of seven RCTs favoured epidural anaesthesia for thoracotomy, suggesting the odds of having PPP three to 18 months following an epidural for thoracotomy were 0.52 compared to not having an epidural (OR 0.52 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.84, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence).

Pooling data at three to 8 months after surgery from four RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia after caesarean section with an OR of 0.46, (95% CI 0.28 to 0.78; 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis of three RCTs investigating continuous infusion with local anaesthetic for the prevention of PPP three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (ICBG) was inconclusive (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09; 123 participants, low-quality evidence). However, evidence synthesis of two RCTs also favoured the infusion of intravenous local anaesthetics for the prevention of PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery with an OR of 0.24 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence). We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac surgery and laparotomy. We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered evidence synthesis. High risk of bias from missing data and lack of blinding across a number of included studies reduced our confidence in the findings. Thus results must be interpreted with caution. We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP after three to 18 months after thoracotomy and three to 12 months after caesarean section. There is low-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery. There is moderate evidence that intravenous infusion of local anaesthetics may reduce the risk of developing PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery. Our conclusions are considerably weakened by the small size and number of studies, by performance bias, null bias, attrition and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies, including children, are needed. We caution that except for breast surgery, our evidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies. On a cautionary note, we cannot extend our conclusions to other surgical interventions or regional anaesthesia techniques, for example we cannot conclude that paravertebral block reduces the risk of PPP after thoracotomy. There are seven ongoing studies and 12 studies awaiting classification that may change the conclusions of the current review once they are published and incorporated.","We included 63 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) in this updated review.

However, we cannot be sure that paravertebral block (blockage of the brain due to bleeding from the chest) is effective in preventing PPP. We did not have sufficient data to be certain about the safety of the technique. We do not know if the technique is safe or whether it is safe. We could not pool the data for adverse effects, as the studies did not report them in a way that would allow us to assess them. We need more studies to be done that are larger, of longer duration and include more patients. We also need to find out if there are benefits or harms of other types of surgery, such as limb amputation, hernia repair, heart surgery and laparotomy. We are not able to draw any conclusions on the benefits or risks of other treatments for breast cancer surgery because we did not find any well-conducted, large-scale studies.', 'In this updated review, we analyzed 63 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on regional anesthesia for preventing long-term postoperative pain (PPP). We found moderate-quality evidence that regional anesthesia may reduce the risk of PPP after thoracotomy and caesarean section, and low-quality evidence that it may reduce the risk after breast cancer surgery. There is also moderate evidence that intravenous local anesthetics may reduce the risk of PPP after breast cancer surgery. However, our conclusions are limited by the small size and number of studies, performance bias, null bias, attrition, and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies are needed,', 'We included 63 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 3027 participants in our review. In total, we included 63 RCTs in the review, but we were only able to synthesize data on regional anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP beyond three months after surgery from 39 studies. We found moderate-quality evidence that epidural anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP after three to 18 months after thoracotomy and three to 12 months after caesarean section. Evidence synthesis of seven studies showed that the odds of having PPP were 0.52 compared to not having an epidural, suggesting the odds were similar. Pooling data at three to 8 months of follow-up, evidence synthesis of four studies found that the likelihood of having a PPP was 0.46 compared to no PPP, suggesting that the risk was similar, and pooled data from four studies suggested that there was no difference in the number of people who developed PPP in the three to eight months after a C-section. We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac surgery and laparotomy. There are seven ongoing studies and 12 studies awaiting classification that may change the conclusions of the current review once they are published and incorporated. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low. There is moderate quality evidence that intravenous infusion of local anaesthetics may reduce PPP three to six months after breast cancer surgery. We are uncertain about the effect of continuous infusion with local anaesthetic three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (ICBG) because of the small number of included studies and the lack of blinding across a number of studies. High risk of bias from missing data reduced our confidence in the findings. We conclude that there is moderate- quality evidence to support the use of regional anaesthetic to prevent PPP up to three to four years after breast surgery. However, except for breast surgery, our evidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies. Thus results must be interpreted with caution. Larger, high-quality studies, including children, are needed.', 'We searched for evidence on 30 May 2017 and identified 63 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared regional anaesthesia with no regional anaesthetic for preventing PPP after thoracotomy or caesarean section. We included 63 RCTs in the review, but we were only able to synthesize data on regional anaesthesiography for the prevention of PPP beyond three months after surgery from 39 studies, enrolling a total of 3027 participants in our analysis. Evidence synthesis of seven RCTS favoured epidural anaesthesia for thoracectomy, suggesting the odds of having PPP three to 18 months following an epidural for thorcotomy were 0.52 compared to not having an epidurals. Evidence syntheses of 18 RCT studies favoured regional anaesthetics for the prevent of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery. Pooling data at three to 8 months after caesarian section from four RCT-based studies favoured the use of regional anaestation after caearean sections. Evidence summary of three RCT trials investigating continuous infusion with local anaesthetic in the prevention and treatment of PPT three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (ICBG) was inconclusive. However, evidence synthesis of two RCT reports also favoured the infusion of intravenous local anaesthetic for the preventive of PP three to six months after cancer surgery, suggesting that intravenous infusion of local anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing PPP. We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac surgery and laparotomy. We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaisation may reduce PPP in women after thoraco- thoracoscopically-related thoracostomy and three to one year after caedare']","[2, 0, 1, 3]"

We did not find any new new drugs since the last Cochrane systematic review in 2012.

It is unclear how many children suffer from tiredness after cancer treatment. The quality of the evidence in this review is weak, and we do not know how much or how often they will be tired.', 'We included 30 studies (18 studies with 18,682 participants in total). Eighteen studies contributed to the main objective and 22 studies to the secondary outcomes. We found substantial differences between studies in the cancer type, the age, the type of cancer, the cancer treatment, the way in which the cancer was treated, and the way that the studies were carried- out. We could not combine the results of the studies, so we present them descriptively. We were able to combine the data from 18 of the 30 studies, but we could not draw any overall conclusions. We are not sure how many childhood cancer patients suffer from severe fatigue. We also found that the risk of severe fatigue in children and adults with brain and bone cancer was higher than in people with blood cancer. We did not find that age at cancer treatment or the age at the time of cancer treatment was a cause for tiredness. We cannot be sure how much of a risk of tiredness children and young people are at risk of after treatment for childhood cancer. The studies were not of high quality, and we were not sure if the results were influenced by the risk and risk factors that we were looking for. We do not know how much tired people are left with after-cancer symptoms. We need more research to find out if there is a role for tired people in the long-term.']","[0, 1, 2, 3]"

Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. For continued exposure, 56 per 1000 workers reported absence of symptoms at follow-up, the decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of a reference value (FEV1 %) was 5.4% during follow-up, and the standardized change in non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH) was -0.18. In 18 studies, authors compared removal from exposure to continued exposure. Removal may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of asthma symptoms, with risk ratio (RR) 4.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 13.86), and it may improve asthma symptoms, with RR 2.47 (95% CI 1.26 to 4.84), compared to continued exposure. Change in FEV1 % may be better with removal from exposure, with a mean difference (MD) of 4.23 % (95% CI 1.14 to 7.31) compared to continued exposure. NSBH may improve with removal from exposure, with standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.43 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.82). In seven studies, authors compared reduction of exposure to continued exposure. Reduction of exposure may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 2.65 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.68). There may be no considerable difference in FEV1 % between reduction and continued exposure, with MD 2.76 % (95% CI -1.53 to 7.04) . No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH. In ten studies, authors compared removal from exposure to reduction of exposure. Following removal from exposure there may be no increase in the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 6.05 (95% CI 0.86 to 42.34), and improvement in symptoms, with RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.47), as well as no considerable change in FEV1 %, with MD 2.58 % (95% CI −3.02 to 8.17). However, with all three outcomes, there may be improved results for removal from exposure in the subset of patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH. In two studies, authors reported that the risk of unemployment after removal from exposure may increase compared with reduction of exposure, with RR 14.28 (95% CI 2.06 to 99.16). Four studies reported a decrease in income of 20% to 50% after removal from exposure. The quality of the evidence is very low for all outcomes. Both removal from exposure and reduction of exposure may improve asthma symptoms compared with continued exposure. Removal from exposure, but not reduction of exposure, may improve lung function compared to continued exposure. When we compared removal from exposure directly to reduction of exposure, the former may improve symptoms and lung function more among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. Removal from exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment. Care providers should balance the potential clinical benefits of removal from exposure or reduction of exposure with potential detrimental effects of unemployment.

Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. For continued exposure 56 per 1000 workers reported absence of symptoms at follow-up, and the decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of a reference value (FEV1 %) was 5.4% in the group of workers who had reduced exposure compared to those who had continued exposure during the study period. The change in non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH) was -0.18. In 18 studies, we found that removal of exposure may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of asthma symptoms, and it may also increase asthma symptoms when compared to continuing exposure. However, with all three outcomes, the quality of the evidence is very low for all outcomes. The reason for this is that the quality and quantity of the included studies was very low. In ten studies, authors compared removal from the exposure to reduction of the exposure, but not reducing exposure, to reduce exposure. There may be no considerable difference in lung function between reduction and continued exposure between the two groups. No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH.

The quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. The evidence is up-to-date as of January 2018.

The main reasons for the low quality are that the number and duration of the studies were small, and that some of the results were imprecise. We are not able to recommend any one method over the other. There is a need for more research in this area. We found that people who work in the same job should not be surprised if they are asked to stop smoking. We recommend that healthcare providers (e.g. healthcare providers) make sure that patients are not aware that they are not allowed to smoke in their work.', 'We studied 26 non-randomized controlled studies with 1,695 participants, comparing complete removal from exposure, reduced exposure, and continued exposure to certain agents. Reduced exposure was achieved through various methods, such as limiting use, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment. For continued exposure, 56 out of 1000 workers reported no symptoms at follow-up. In 18 studies, removal from exposure was compared to continued exposure. Removal may increase the likelihood of reporting no asthma symptoms and improve asthma symptoms compared to continued exposure. Lung function may also improve with removal from exposure. In seven studies, reduced exposure was compared to continued exposure', 'We included 26 studies with 1.6 million people in the review. The studies compared the effects of reducing exposure to the agent, reducing exposure, or reducing exposure. The evidence is current to September 2015. The review found that reducing exposure may improve symptoms and lung function compared to continued exposure. It also found that reduction of exposure may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, and it may improve asthma symptoms compared to continuing exposure. However, reducing the exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment. The quality of the evidence is very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of the review were the small number of studies and the small numbers of people in each study. We recommend that future studies should be larger and of high quality.']","[1, 2, 0, 3]"

Indiscriminate pooling of survival data from 2197 women shows a significant overall survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy (RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.79 to 0.99)). Sensitivity analysis focused on trials of modern platinum based chemotherapy regimens and found the relative risk of death to be 0.85 ((0.76 to 0.96); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) = 25; absolute risk reduction = 4% (1% to 8%)). The HR for overall survival is 0.74 (0.64 to 0.89), significantly favouring the addition of postoperative platinum based chemotherapy. The HR for progression-free survival is 0.75 (0.64 to 0.89).

Chemotherapy reduces the risk of developing the first recurrence outside the pelvis (RR = 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92), 5% absolute risk reduction; NNT = 20).

Chemotherapy lowered the risk of the first recurrence outside the pelvis but may be less effective than radiotherapy alone. However, it has added value when used with radiotherapy. In conclusion, postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy offers a', 'Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) compared no additional treatment with additional chemotherapy after hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Four trials compared platinum based combination chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy, and one trial compared chemotherapy directly to radiotherapy alone. Postoperative platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a small benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival irrespective of radiotherapy treatment. Indiscriminate pooling of survival data from 2197 women shows a significant overall survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy (RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.79 to 0.99)). This means that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any stage of the disease by a quarter. The risk of developing the first recurrence outside the pelvis is 5% absolute risk reduction. The analysis of pelvic recurrence rates is underpowered but the trend suggests that chemotherapy may be less effective than radiotherapy in a direct comparison but it may have added value when used with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be an alternative to chemotherapy and could be an additional treatment for radiotherapy when used together.']","[2, 3, 0, 1]"

Intraocular pressure was also reduced in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving intraoperative 5-FU (mean difference (MD) -1.04, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.43) and regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -4.67, 95% CI -6.60 to -2.73).

Postoperative injections of 5-FU are now rarely used as part of routine packages of postoperative care but are increasingly used on an ad hoc basis. This presumably reflects an aspect of the treatment that is unacceptable to both patients and doctors. None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care, which constitutes a serious omission for an invasive treatment such as this.

The review of trials found that in the first year after trabeculectomy, the risk of failure of the surgery was 4.1% for the high risk of failed surgery group and 5.0% in the low-dose postoperation group. No difference was found between the low and high-dose groups in terms of failure rate at the first time after surgery, or in the number of surgeries that failed.

All studies had a high risk of bias (i.e. they were conducted in a way that could bias the results). One of them was of Sulomylurea (a drug used to lower blood pressure) and the other were of GAD65 (drug used to control high blood pressure). One study was of ursodeoxycholic acid decarboxylase (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measure of glycosylation of glucose in the blood) and one was of gingko biloba (a medicine used to treat diabetes). Two of them were of the type commonly used in the treatment of LADA. One of the studies of ersodeoxychaemia (a disease of the pancreas) was of the kind that leads to low blood pressure (hypoglycaemic episodes) and four of the types of diabetes mellitus (low blood pressure due to lack of protein in the urine) were included in the meta-analysis. One study showed that sugarcosylate (sugar) with or without metformin (a long-acting antidiabetic drug) was more likely to improve the blood pressure of patients with LADA at three months and 12 months of treatment and follow-up. There was no effect on the blood sugar levels at any time of the intervention. Two studies showed that the use of a herbal medicine (sulfonylureate) was associated with a longer time of fasting C-peptide (the length of time it takes to reach the correct glucose levels) than insulin alone (three months to 10 years). One trial showed that using a Chinese medicine (pregabalin hydroxide) in a short-term (three weeks) did not show that the herbal medicine improved the blood glucose levels compared to insulin alone. One trial of vitamin D with insulin showed a longer duration of treatment (three to 12 months) in the vitamin D group than in the insulin alone group but a shorter duration of therapy (eight weeks). In addition, there was evidence that patients in the placebo group had more severe hypoglycaemia episodes than those in the usual care group (30% in placebo group compared to 5% in conventional care group; 64% in insulin group and 12.5% in the urethrae.com study; both of which were in the U.S. study; one of which was in the USA). There were no studies of other treatments such as glucocorticoids (drugs used to reduce glucose levels in blood) or antidiabetes drugs (drug taken by mouth). Two studies show that there is a risk of early (two-year) onset of low blood sugars in people with LAD. There is a need for more studies to be done to find out which is the best way to treat LADA and if one treatment is best.', 'The text discusses a study that analyzed 15 publications with 1019 participants who were followed for three months to 10 years. The main focus was on the effects of sulphonylurea (SU) with insulin on metabolic control. The results showed that SU with insulin did not significantly improve metabolic control compared to insulin alone. Additionally, SU led to earlier insulin dependence in some cases. Vitamin D with insulin showed potential in protecting pancreatic beta cells in LADA patients. A novel treatment, GAD65, was suggested to maintain fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels. However, there is no significant evidence supporting other treatments for LADA.', 'This review of trials found that sulphonylurea (a drug) with insulin did not lead to better control of blood glucose levels than oral therapy.

Studies evaluating bromocriptine, clonidine, propranolol and levodopa reported our primary outcome of indices of bruxism motor activity. Results were imprecise and consistent with benefit, no difference or harm. These were the specific findings for each of the drugs according to specific outcomes: 1. Amitriptyline versus placebo for masseteric electromyography (EMG) activity per minute: standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.91 to 0.34; P value = 0.37), 2. bromocriptine versus placebo for bruxism episodes per hour: mean difference (MD) 0.60 (95% CI -2.93 to 4.13), bruxism bursts per hour: MD -2.00 (95% CI -53.47 to 49.47), bruxism bursts per episode: MD 0.50 (95% CI -1.85 to 2.85) or number of episodes with grinding noise: MD 2.40 (95% CI -24.00 to 28.80), 3. clonidine versus placebo for number of bruxism episodes per hour: MD -2.41 (95% CI -4.84 to 0.02), 4. propranolol versus placebo for the number of bruxism episodes per hour: MD 1.16 (95% CI -1.89 to 4.21), 5.

However, two studies showed that quite severe or debilitating AEs were only detected by an interview, while other studies did not find a difference in the nature of AEs between elicitation methods.

The methods used to answer questions were different, with some studies using a more general approach (e.g. open questions) and others using a particular approach (such as a specific question). The studies were conducted in a variety of countries, and the methods varied in terms of the type of AEs, the duration, and how they were assessed. We found that more questions were more likely to be asked, but we could not be sure if the methods were more or less likely to lead to more AEs. We were able, in two of the studies, to show that more specific questions led to more AE cases being detected. We could not tell if the questions were as good as they could be, but it was clear that more people who were asked a question were more than twice as sure that they had at least one AE. We did not find that the methods that we used to ask the questions led more or more AE-positive people. We are not sure if this was due to the way the questions had been asked, or if the way they were written.

The studies we found did not use the same methods, and we could be less sure that the results were the same. We think that the way that the questions are asked in a trial may have an effect on the AEs that are detected. The quality of the methods was low, and that we were not sure how the methods would be used to better answer the questions. We also thought that the studies were too small to be sure that we would be more certain that we had found the AE.

Most of them compared them with one or more of the same type of question. We did not find any studies that compared them to each other. We found that when we asked people with AEs about their experiences, more AEs were found when we used a more detailed approach (e.g. the severity of the AEs, how often they were reported, how many AEs they were assessed, how they were graded, assessed for a relationship to the study drug, and how many AE endpoints were reported). This means that we do not know if the methods used to answer these questions are as good as we think they should be. We are not able to draw conclusions about the impact of the question method on the number of participants with at least one AE because we did not have enough data. However, we do know that if we do find one AE, it will probably be missed by the study staff. We do not think that staff or patients would know which type of AE they were asked, as this would not have been done in the usual way.

We could not find studies that measured the number of people who died or had a hospital stay. We assessed 17 full- text papers as of high quality. We rated the quality of the evidence as low or very low. We identified 15 studies, but eight of these did not assess the interventions to prevent the onset of SUDEP; five of these studies used a device that could be used to detect GTCS, but did't measure the risk factors for SUDE (elevator, sound, and light); and two of these two studies assessed risk factors to prevent a case of SU DE but not interventions for preventing SUDEP. One study is awaiting classification. We included one study in this review. This study of 154 people found that noctular surveillance increased noctulary supervision for people with epilepsy who had SUDEP in the night. This result was based on a qualitative analysis. We judged the quality to be very low, meaning that further research is very uncertain. We also found no studies that assessed the effects on the number or number of deaths,"", 'We identified 582 records from the databases and search strategies. We found 10 further records by searching other resources (handsearching). We searched for all of these records and found 381 records. We assessed all of them as having a high risk of bias (i.e. high chance of misleading results due to the way the study was designed and performed). We found one case-control study (a study in which one group of people (the control group) received the intervention) and the other group (the intervention group) got the usual care) but did not. This study of 154 cases of suDEP and 616 cases of GTCS found that people in the control group had a lower risk of having nocturnal control of their epileptic seizures than those in the intervention group. This effect was found when a supervising person shared the same bed as them or when they were used to sleep in the same room as them. We did not find any change in the number of non-SUDEP deaths, changes in anxiety, depression, and quality of life, or changes in the need for the person to be cared for in hospital. We judged the quality of the evidence for most of the results to be very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the results.']","[1, 0, 3, 2]"

Most of the people included in the trials had mild to severe cysts (e.g. cysts on the legs).

The quality of evidence was generally low due to small study sizes and unclear data presentation. No clear evidence was found for the effectiveness of different iodine preparations or zinc oxide mesh dressings. Moderate quality evidence suggested that sucralfate cream and honey-soaked gauze may improve healing, while low quality evidence indicated that Triclosan and Dermacym® could also be beneficial. However, due to the limited and low-quality evidence, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these treatments.', 'This is an update of the previous version, which was published in 2013. We found 11 studies with a total of 886 patients. These looked at a range of surgical wounds, mainly those that had been removed because they were painful to treat. There were a number of different types of dressings used, which varied from the type of wound to the thickness of the skin. We did not find any studies that looked at the use of antiseptic/antibiotics. There was some low- or very low-quality evidence that using a sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy, when used with either a honey-soaked gauze cream or a plain mesh dressing. However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. One study found that more Dermacym®-treated foot wounds healed with a honey cream than with the EUSOL cream. The quality of evidence was low for most comparisons. This means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change this estimate.', 'Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons in surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. In general studies were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors reduced the quality of the evidence. There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy when treated with Triclosan post-operatively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (mean difference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01). This was classed as low quality evidence. One study compared a zinc oxide mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality. There were no clear differences in the time to wound healing between groups. However, there was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics) which favoured the zinc oxide group. One small study reported that sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds compared to a petrolatum cream over a three week period. The study also reported lower wound pain scores in participants who were treated with this cream. Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants. The evidence for possible treatment effects was reported from single studies with small participant numbers and was rated as moderate or low quality. This means it is likely or very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect, and may change this estimate. There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence was reported, it was based on a single study with small numbers of participants and was assessed as moderate to low quality, which means that we are very uncertain about the effect of these treatments. The quality of evidence was low due to the small number of included studies and the small size of the included studies.']","[3, 0, 2, 1]"

Six studies were conducted in upper-middle-income countries (China, Mexico, South Africa), one study was conducted in a lower-middle-income country (Bangladesh), and three studies were conducted in a high-income country (Canada). Seven studies examined wheat flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients. Three studies included maize flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients. The duration of interventions ranged from two weeks to 36 months, and the ITS studies included postfortification periods of up to seven years. Most studies had unclear risk of bias for randomisation, blinding, and reporting, and low/unclear risk of bias for attrition and contamination. Neural tube defects: none of the included RCTs reported neural tube defects as an outcome. In one non-RCT, wheat flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients was associated with significantly lower occurrence of total neural tube defects, spina bifida, and encephalocoele, but not anencephaly, compared to unfortified flour (total neural tube defects risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.48; 1 study, 8037 births; low-certainty evidence). Folate status: pregnant women who received folic acid-fortified maize porridge had significantly higher erythrocyte folate concentrations (mean difference (MD) 238.90 nmol/L, 95% CI 149.40 to 328.40); 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and higher plasma folate (MD 14.98 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.63 to 20.33; 1 study, 38 participants; very low-certainty evidence), compared to no intervention.

Evidence is limited for the effects of folic acid-fortified wheat or maize flour on haemoglobin levels or anaemia. The effects of folic acid fortification of wheat or maize flour on other primary outcomes assessed in this review is not known. No studies reported on the occurrence of adverse effects.

We found no difference in haemoglobin or anaemia (the amount of red blood cells found in the other side of the body) or in the levels of iron and iron in their blood. In another non-controlled study, there was no effect on anaemia. There was no evidence on the effect of using maize flour flour on death from any cause.

There was evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous albumin on OHSS, though heterogeneity was substantial (seven studies, 1452 high risk women; I² = 69%, very low quality evidence). This suggests that if the rate of moderate or severe OHSS with no treatment is 12%, it will be about 9% (6% to 12%) with the use of albumin. However, there was some evidence that albumin may have a detrimental effect on pregnancy rates. If the chance of pregnancy is 40% without treatment, it will probably be about 32% (27% to 38%).

Comparing pre-emptive therapy to prophylaxis showed no significant difference in preventing CMV disease, but pre-emptive', 'We found 15 randomised trials (RCTs) with 1098 participants. Pre-emptive therapy is an immunosuppressive drug that is used to prevent the spread of CMV in the body. The evidence is up-to-date as of 15 November 2015. Preemptive treatment was compared with placebo (sugar pill) or the use of antiviral drugs (drugs that kill the virus) to prevent CMV disease in adults who had received an organ transplant. Six of the 15 RCTs were in adults (aged 18 or over) with CMV when the disease occurred (standard care), eight studies in adult (18 to 65 years old) patients (1098 participants) looked at pre-emptives compared with antiviral drug prophylaxis (drug used to treat the virus). One of the studies in children (aged 12 to 18 years) was in adult patients (16 to 24 years old). The duration of the intervention ranged from three to 12 months. Preers may reduce the risk of developing CMV diseases when compared with a placebo or standard care. However, the benefits and harms of preers are not clear due to the small number of studies and the low numbers of participants. Other side-effects such as leucopenia and graft loss did not differ significantly between preers and antiviral therapy. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. All of the trials were at low risk of bias, which means that the true result is likely to be close to the truth.', 'We identified 15 studies (1098 participants) that compared pre-emptive therapy with no pre-pre-preventive treatment (placebo) or with antivirals (drugs) to treat CMV-infected patients. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United Kingdom. The evidence is current to August 2015. Pre-emptives compared with placebo or standard care (standard care) reduced the risk of CMV disease but not acute rejection or death from any cause. Preemptive treatment did not reduce the risk for CMV graft loss or the risk from any causes. The risk of developing leucopenia (inflammation of the mucosa) was significantly less common with pre-pretend therapy compared with prophylaxis. Other adverse effects did not differ significantly or were not reported. There were no significant differences in the risks of all-cause mortality, graft loss, acute rejection and infections other than CMV. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate.

For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease areas, countries, healthcare and community settings. Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value < 0.0001), addition of an offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value < 0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value < 0.005).

In 2013, we searched for all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compared strategies to help people who were not able to return to trial sites for the next two or more years. We found 38 randomised trials. Most of them were conducted across a range of disease areas, countries, healthcare and community settings. For 34 of the 34 trials, people were able to take all of the questionnaires (postal and electronic) for at least one year. For the other four trials, only one of the participants remained in the trial. The evidence is up-to-date as of 4 February 2015. The included trials looked at a wide range of strategies to increase the number of people who are able to go back to the trial site for trial follow-up. These were the use of incentives (e.g. money) for people not wanting to take their questionnaires, giving them a 'non-monetary' (non-payment for no treatment) incentive, 'enhanced' letters, letters delivered by priority post, or a questionnaire question order order. There were few studies that looked at ways to improve the rate of people returning to the study sites for a second year or more. There was no good evidence that the addition of a non-monencement, an increase in the amount of money they are offered, or an offer of a 'improvement in quality of life' or a 'health' or 'preferably' treatment resulted in more or less return of the questionnaire. There appeared to be little or no improvement in the rates of return of questionnaires when a 'blind' trial design was used for one trial. An open trial design appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionsnaires in one study. There did not seem to be a need for a blind study to be run by a pharmacist. There does not appear to be any benefit from any of the strategies used in this systematic review. However, we do not know if some strategies are better than others.

Our analysis was hampered by the fact that a large proportion of the included studies reported no events in either study arm. No studies reported significant differences between devices in relation to the primary review outcome: failure to adequately mechanically ventilate. We evaluated this outcome by assessing two variables: inadequate oxygenation (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.31; four studies, N = 617) and inadequate ventilation (not estimable; one study, N = 80).

411,"We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study). We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children).

There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity.

We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome. We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations.","We included 19 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1453 participants.

We found that children who received probiotics were more likely to have a greater reduction in pain at zero to three months of age than those who received a placebo. There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point as well as in the placebo group.

Data on secondary outcomes were sparse. Cost data were provided on request for three studies (n = 416), were highly variable, and did not address cost-effectiveness. Two studies (n = 455) contained statements about adverse effects and neither reported finding any. Mass media interventions may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes. Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents. The findings are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review. Such research should use robust methods, report data more consistently with reporting guidelines and be less reliant on student populations.","We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants.

All were randomised trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data. Seventeen of the studies had student populations. The studies were very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, interventions and outcomes, and only two meta-analyses within two subgroups were warranted. Findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes (n = 1196) were mixed, with effects showing a reduction, increase or consistent with no evidence of effect. Odds ratios (OR) for the two studies (802) with dichotomous discrimination outcomes showed no effect: results were 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 3.19) and 1.19 (CI 0.85 to 1.65). The 19 trials with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention, at the three following time periods: -0.38 (immediate), -038 (1 week to 2 months) and -049 (6 to 9 months). SMDs for prejudice outcomes across all studies ranged from -2.94 to 2.40.

Most of the studies had a high risk of bias (i.e. bias due to the way they were designed and performed). Most of them had a low risk of systematic bias (that is, overestimation of the true effect because of the way the studies were run and reported). The findings from the five randomised trials with the most common type of bias were mixed, with effects shown a small to medium reduction in the level of bias. We found that the three trials with continuous outcomes (involving 394 participants) showed that the intervention may have a moderate to medium decrease in the amount of bias, which is about the same as the other treatments (1 week to 2 months) and about the other treatment (6 to 9 months). However, we found that it is not clear if it makes a big impact on the rate of bias because the results of the other trials were mixed. We are not able to draw any conclusions about the effect of mass media interventions on bias because we did not find any studies that looked at this. We do not know about the cost of mass interventions. The quality of the evidence was low for the main outcomes for bias and bias, low for side effects and very low for costs. More research is needed to find out which type of mass intervention works best, to better understand which types of mass treatment work best, and to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness.

The studies were very different in their populations, media types, and ways of making the interventions. Most of them had a small to medium-size effect in reducing the level of bias. We found that mass media programmes may have a small but medium-to-small effect in the reduction of bias, and that they may be equivalent to the level that is commonly seen in people with mental health problems. We could not find any studies that looked at the effects of mass media on the cost-effectiveness of the programmes. We did not find studies that examined the cost of the mass media programs. We are not sure if mass media campaigns are cost-free. We do not know if they are harmful.

Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers.

We also developed two lines of argument, using high- or moderate-confidence findings: For women, initial or continued use of ANC depends on a perception that doing so will be a positive experience. This is a result of the provision of good-quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees and that include continuity of care that is authentically personalised, kind, caring, supportive, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful of women’s need for privacy, and that allow staff to take the time needed to provide relevant support, information and clinical safety for the woman and the baby, as and when they need it. Women’s perceptions of the value of ANC depend on their general beliefs about pregnancy as a healthy or a risky state, and on their reaction to being pregnant, as well as on local socio-cultural norms relating to the advantages or otherwise of antenatal care for healthy pregnancies, and for those with complications. Whether they continue to use ANC or not depends on their experience of ANC design and provision when they access it for the first time. The capacity of healthcare providers to deliver the kind of high-quality, relationship-based, locally accessible ANC that is likely to facilitate access by women depends on the provision of sufficient resources and staffing as well as the time to provide flexible personalised, private appointments that are not overloaded with organisational tasks. Such provision also depends on organisational norms and values that overtly value kind, caring staff who make effective, culturally-appropriate links with local communities, who respect women’s belief that pregnancy is usually a normal life event, but who can recognise and respond to complications when they arise. Healthcare providers also require sufficient training and education to do their job well, as well as an adequate salary, so that they do not need to demand extra informal funds from women and families, to supplement their income, or to fund essential supplies.

We included 85 studies that took place in 41 countries, including eight high- and 18 low-income (eight high-income) countries, 18 middle- and 15 low-countries, in rural, urban and semi-urban areas. Forty-six of the studies looked at the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postbirth women, 17 of them explored the views of healthcare providers, and 22 of them looked at both women and healthcare providers. We found that for women, initial or continued use of antenatal care depends on a perception that doing so will be a good experience. This is a result of the use of good-quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees (e.g. fees for care by a midwife, obstetricians, or midwives), and that allow healthcare providers to take the time needed to support the woman and the baby, as and when they need it. For health providers, first-time use of ANC depends on their experience of using it for the first time (i.e. if they are not pregnant at the time of birth or in a healthy or a risky state), as well as on women’s perceptions of the quality of care they receive. Whether they use ANC or not is based on their impression that it is a good quality and safe service, and their perception that it should be provided to them. This means that if they do not use it, they will not be able to use it because other healthcare providers will not provide it. We have found that healthcare providers need to do their job well, and need to be paid an adequate amount of money to do it. They need to take care of women and their babies, as they are the most likely to do so. They are likely to be good at doing their job because they are used to providing healthcare services and they are well-known to women. They also need to know that they are doing a good job and do not need to get paid for the care they are providing. The quality of the evidence in this review is high.

For oral nimodipine alone the RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.81), for other calcium antagonists or intravenous administration of nimodipine the results were not statistically significant.

As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate-risk disease have been included in the high-risk groups.

All studies had some limitations in the way they were designed and performed. We found that when we looked at the data from three of the studies we found that people with high- risk brain cancer who were treated with myelablative therapy had a longer time to live than those who received no treatment or received a placebo (a pretend) treatment. We did not have enough data to be able to draw conclusions about side effects or quality of life. One of the trials (379 children) showed a significantly higher risk of kidney problems (myelitis) and veno-occlusive (venous) disease in the myeloabilitated group compared to the control group.

The evidence is current to January 2014. The three studies included 739 children. The results of the studies showed that myeloablation therapy seems to be effective in terms of event-free survival. However, when additional follow-up data were included in the analyses, the difference in event- free survival was no longer statistically significant. The overall survival of children with high- risk neuroblastomies was not significantly different between the treatment groups. The risk of side effects was higher in the myeloabilative group. Data from one study (379 patients) showed a significantly higher incidence of renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis and veno-occlusive disease in the treatment group compared to conventional chemotherapy, whereas for serious infections and sepsis no significant difference between the two treatment groups was identified. No information on quality of life was reported. In the individual studies we evaluated different subgroups, but the results were not univocal in all studies. All studies had some methodological limitations. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. The main limitation of the review was that the studies were small and had a short follow- up period. Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.']","[2, 0, 1, 3]"

The meta-analysis (including all fibrate trials) showed evidence for a protective effect of fibrates primarily compared to placebo for the primary composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.94; participants = 16,064; studies = 12; I2 = 45%, fixed effect).

Excluding clofibrate trials, as the use of clofibrate was discontinued in 2002 due to safety concerns, the remaining class of fibrates were no longer effective in preventing the primary composite outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; participants = 10,320; studies = 7; I2 = 50%, random effects). However, without clofibrate data, fibrates remained effective in preventing MI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; participants = 8304; studies = 6; I2 = 47%, fixed effect). There was no increase in adverse events with fibrates compared to control. Subgroup analyses showed the benefit of fibrates on the primary composite outcome to be consistent irrespective of age, gender, and diabetes mellitus. Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI, and vascular death. However, this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion of clofibrate data, a drug that was discontinued in 2002 due to its unacceptably large adverse effects.

The average pain experienced by participants undergoing endometry was 6/10 on a zero-10 visual analogue scale (VAS) and only one study reported this outcome. However, only one of the studies reported this. The pooled results should be interpreted with caution as we graded the quality as either low or very low as we downgraded the quality because of the risk of bias in the included studies. The main reasons we downgrade the quality were most included studies were at a high risk of systematic error and had an overall low level of precision. Further well-conducted RCTs that recruit large numbers of participants and minimise internal bias are required to confirm or refute these findings.']","[1, 2, 0, 3]"

The studies were of good quality. We found that self-minding by a self-referral device (SMB) can be a safe and effective way to improve blood glucose control in people who are not using standard care. The effect of SMBG on glycassimension (a measure of blood blood glucose) is small up to six months of self self-watch, but the effect of self monitoring by a reflectance meter (a device that reflects blood glucose levels) is not significant. The cost-effect of selfmonitoring is not clear. We did not find any clear evidence that SMBG affects well-being, general well-ness or general health. We conclude that when the duration of treatment is over one year, the effect on glyci is small. The effects of SMB on blood glucose are not clear, but we do not find that self selfmonitorings by a monitor are more cost-effective.

431,"We identified seven new studies in this update. We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not included in this update. This review contains a total of 62 included studies, with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Overall we judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release (MIR). Fourteen studies compared Mm/r in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products. Fifteen studies compared Mm/r with other opioids. Six studies compared MIR with other opioids. Two studies compared oral Mm/r with rectal Mm/r. Three studies compared MIR with MIR by a different route of administration. Two studies compared Mm/r with Mm/r at different times and two compared MIR with MIR given at a different time. One study was found comparing each of the following: Mm/r tablet with Mm/r suspension; Mm/r with non-opioids; MIR with non-opioids; and oral morphine with epidural morphine. In the previous update, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale (VAS), or the equivalent in other pain scales. Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief were not attained. Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638). Morphine is an effective analgesic for cancer pain. Pain relief did not differ between Mm/r and MIR. Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation. Daily doses in studies ranged from 25 mg to 2000 mg with an average of between 100 mg and 250 mg. Dose titration was undertaken with both instant release and modified release products. A small number of participants did not achieve adequate analgesia with morphine. Adverse events were common, predictable, and approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment with morphine because of intolerable adverse events. The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations. The conclusions have not changed for this update. The effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine. Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief, but where it was reported, over 90% had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time period. The review demonstrates the wide dose range of morphine used in studies, and that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral morphine. The review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in cross-over designs. Trial design was frequently based on titration of morphine or comparator to achieve adequate analgesia, then crossing participants over in cross-over design studies. It was not clear if these trials were sufficiently powered to detect any clinical differences between formulations or comparator drugs. New studies added to the review for the previous update reinforced the view that it is possible to use modified release morphine to titrate to analgesic effect. There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.","We included 62 studies with 4241 participants in this review. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release with morphine immediate release (Mm/r) preparations, and 14 studies compared morphine in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products. Pain relief did not differ between oral morphine and MIR. In the previous update of this review, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale (VAS), or the equivalent in other pain scales. Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain reduction were not attained. Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, pain relief was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638). Morphine is an effective analgesic for cancer pain. The effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine. Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations.

Six were excluded, and one is ongoing. The review now has 62 studies with 4,241 participants. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor reporting of randomization and allocation concealment. The main outcomes were pain and pain relief reported by participants. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) with immediate release (MIR). Fourteen studies compared different strengths of Mm/r, and fifteen compared Mm/r with other opioids. Six studies compared MIR with other opioids. Other comparisons included different routes of administration, timings, and', 'This is an update of the last Cochrane review, which was published in 2013. We searched for all the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) we found. We included 62 RCTs with a total of 4241 participants. The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies are old, often small, and were carried out for a wide range of reasons. Most of them were of short duration (no more than seven days), which makes them less useful in terms of pain relief (i.e. from one to 15 days), although we did not find any new trials for this update. This review shows that oral morphine is an effective analgesic for cancer pain. It is most commonly used for 12 to 24 hours, and most of the studies (18/19) showed that it was as good as or better than Mm/r. About 6% of people had to stop treatment with morphine due to side-effects. The most common side-effect was mild pain (4% in the oral morphine group and 1% in each of the other group) that was severe enough to be stopped taking the medicine. About 5% of the people in the studies had no worse than mild pain, which is the same as in the control group (1% in both groups) and about 2% in either group (17/377). Most studies did not report how many people had good pain relief, which means that over 90% of those who did not have good pain were not able to experience good pain pain in the short-term (one to three days). The most frequent side-side-effects that we found were mild (2% in oral morphine and 0% in placebo) or very severe (6% in total) in both treatment groups. About 3% of participants stopped the medicine due to these side effects. We found that most studies were of low or very low quality, which makes it hard to be sure that they were of good quality. We have not found any new studies since the last update of 2013.', 'We searched for evidence from randomisation trials comparing morphine with other drugs or with no treatment. We included 62 studies, with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design, which means that people were randomly assigned to one or more groups. The studies were of good quality, but the way they were designed was poor. The results of the studies were not all consistent. The main outcome was pain. The evidence is current to September 2015. We found that morphine is an effective pain medicine for cancer pain. Morphine is an opioid that is effective for pain relief in people with cancer. The effect of morphine on pain is similar to other opioids. The effects of morphine are similar to those of other opioids, but morphine is more expensive and has to be taken for a longer time. The effectiveness of morphine has not changed since the previous version of this review. The review shows that morphine has a wide range of doses of morphine used in studies, and that a small percentage of people are unable to tolerate oral morphine. The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Most studies were small and of poor quality. The trials were old, often small, and were mostly carried out for registration purposes. The conclusions of this update have not changed from those of the previous one. The findings of this updated review are based on a previous version published in 2010. We have updated the review for the previous update and found that it is possible to use modified release morphine to titrate to analgesic effect. The new version of the review found that modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation. The newer version of morphine was effective for up to 12 hours. The older version of Mm/r was effective up to 24 hours.', ""We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared morphine for cancer pain. We found 62 studies, with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release preparations (MIR). Fourteen studies used morphine in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products. Six studies compared morphine with other opioids. Three studies compared MIR with MIR by a different route of administration. One study was found comparing each of the following: oral morphine tablet with a non-opioid; oral morphine suspension with an opioid; and oral morphine with epidural morphine. Two studies compared the same morphine formulation with rectal morphine; and two studies compared different morphine formulations given at different times and two compared morphine given at a different time. The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations. Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis. The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief. Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638). Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain reduction were not attained. Pain relief did not differ between Mm and MIR. A small number of participants did not achieve adequate pain relief with morphine.

The results have not changed for this update. The effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine. Adverse events were common, predictable, and approximately 6% of people discontinued treatment with morphine because of intolerable adverse events. The evidence is current to May 2015. We included seven new studies in this review. We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not included in the update. We judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported.""]","[0, 2, 3, 1]"
432,"Fourteen trials were included, totalling 1260 participants, with 1361 trigger fingers. The age of participants included in the studies ranged from 16 to 88 years; and the majority of participants were women (approximately 70%). The average duration of symptoms ranged from three to 15 months, and the follow-up after the procedure ranged from eight weeks to 23 months. The studies reported nine types of comparisons: open surgery versus steroid injections (two studies); percutaneous surgery versus steroid injection (five studies); open surgery versus steroid injection plus ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery plus steroid injection versus steroid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery versus open surgery (five studies); endoscopic surgery versus open surgery (one study); and three comparisons of types of incision for open surgery (transverse incision of the skin in the distal palmar crease, transverse incision of the skin about 2–3 mm distally from distal palmar crease, and longitudinal incision of the skin) (one study). Most studies had significant methodological flaws and were considered at high or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias. The primary comparison was open surgery versus steroid injections, because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid injection is the least invasive control treatment method as reported in the studies in this review and is often used as first-line treatment in clinical practice. Compared with steroid injection, there was low-quality evidence that open surgery provides benefits with respect to less triggering recurrence, although it has the disadvantage of being more painful. Evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws and imprecision. Based on two trials (270 participants) from six up to 12 months, 50/130 (or 385 per 1000) individuals had recurrence of trigger finger in the steroid injection group compared with 8/140 (or 65 per 1000; range 35 to 127) in the open surgery group, RR 0.17 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.33), for an absolute risk difference that 29% fewer people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery (60% fewer to 3% more individuals); relative change translates to improvement of 83% in the open surgery group (67% to 91% better). At one week, 9/49 (184 per 1000) people had pain on the palm of the hand in the steroid injection group compared with 38/56 (or 678 per 1000; ranging from 366 to 1000) in the open surgery group, RR 3.69 (95% CI 1.99 to 6.85), for an absolute risk difference that 49% more had pain with open surgery (33% to 66% more); relative change translates to worsening of 269% (585% to 99% worse) (one trial, 105 participants). Because of very low quality evidence from two trials we are uncertain whether open surgery improve resolution of trigger finger in the follow-up at six to 12 months, when compared with steroid injection (131/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 80/130 in the control group; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.76); evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws, inconsistency and imprecision. Low-quality evidence from two trials and few event rates (270 participants) from six up to 12 months of follow-up, we are uncertain whether open surgery increased the risk of adverse events (incidence of infection, tendon injury, flare, cutaneous discomfort and fat necrosis) (18/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 17/130 in the control group; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.84) and neurovascular injury (9/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 4/130 in the control group; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.7 to 6.77). Twelve participants (8 versus 4) did not complete the follow-up, and it was considered that they did not have a positive outcome in the data analysis. We are uncertain whether open surgery was more effective than steroid injection in improving hand function or participant satisfaction as studies did not report these outcomes. Low-quality evidence indicates that, compared with steroid injection, open surgical treatment in people with trigger finger, may result in a less recurrence rate from six up to 12 months following the treatment, although it increases the incidence of pain during the first follow-up week. We are uncertain about the effect of open surgery with regard to the resolution rate in follow-up at six to 12 months, compared with steroid injections, due high heterogeneity and few events occurred in the trials; we are uncertain too about the risk of adverse events and neurovascular injury because of a few events occurred in the studies. Hand function or participant satisfaction were not reported.","Fourteen trials were included, totalling 1260 participants, with 1361 trigger fingers.

Because of the low quality of the evidence, we are not able to say if open surgery is better or worse than steroids for resolving the symptoms of trigger finger. We are unable to make any conclusions about the safety of open surgery because the number of people who have had a flare-up of the condition (18/140 in the open surgery group and 17/130 in the placebo-controlled group) and because of the very low number of events (2/70 in the control group) from six up to 12 months after the end of treatment.', 'Fourteen trials were included in this review, totalling 1260 participants, with 1361 trigger fingers.

434,"We included five trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 1 to 30 per hour). All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow-up time ranged from six weeks to four months. Three RCTs (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo; two RCTs compared oral montelukast against placebo (n = 103). We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis since the patients were not analysed as randomised. We also had concerns about selective reporting in another trial. We are uncertain about the difference in AHI (MD −3.18, 95% CI −8.70 to 2.35) between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids compared to placebo (2 studies, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence). In contrast, children receiving oral montelukast had a lower AHI (MD −3.41, 95% CI −5.36 to −1.45) compared to those in the placebo group (2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Children receiving oral montelukast had a lower respiratory arousal index (MD −2.89, 95% CI −4.68 to −1.10; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and nadir of oxygen saturation (MD 4.07, 95% CI 2.27 to 5.88; 2 studies, 103 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those in the placebo group. We are uncertain, however, about the difference in desaturation index (MD −2.50, 95% CI −5.53 to 0.54; 2 studies, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence) between the montelukast and placebo group. Adverse events were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding), and evenly distributed between study groups. No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA as an outcome. There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of OSA in children; they may have short-term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies. Montelukast has short-term beneficial treatment effects for OSA in otherwise healthy, non-obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. In addition, montelukast was well tolerated in the children studied. The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography-based outcomes in children. Long-term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in childhood are still not available. In addition, patient-centred outcomes like concentration ability, vigilance, or school performance have not been investigated yet. There are currently no RCTs on the use of other kinds of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children. Future RCTs should investigate sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA, and long-term safety of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children and include patient-centred outcomes.","We included five trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 1 to 30 per hour).

In contrast, we are confident in the effect on desaturation index and oxygen saturation (moderate-certainties evidence) in children with mild-to-moderate OSA, but we are uncertain whether there is a difference in these two secondary outcomes between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. In addition, we have moderate certainty in the short-term beneficial treatment effects for OSA in otherwise healthy, non-obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two other outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas, sleepiness, and respiratory arousals during sleep. The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography-based outcomes in children. Adverse events were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding), and evenly distributed between study groups.

All five of the studies were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow-up time ranged from six weeks to four months. Three of the trials (n = 137) looked at the use of medications to treat OSA, and the other three looked at medicines to reduce apnoeas (shortness of breath), low heart rate, and rapid heart rate during sleep. One of the two trials (involving 103 children) looked into the effect of oral methadone (medicine taken by mouth) for OSA. All of the children included in the study had mild to severe OSA; however, they were not of the same age as the children in the control group. Two of the five trials looked at children with OSA that were not undergoing surgery (surgery to remove part of the oesophagus or the windpipe). All five studies were of short-term use (i.e. six weeks or less). In one of them, the patients were not randomised to the treatment group. In the other study, the people in the placebo group were not randomized to the therapy group. We are uncertain about the differences in AHI between the two groups. In contrast, we are not sure whether the differences between the other than the AHI (desaturation index) and the respiratory rate (respirator of the lungs) are the same as in the children who received the treatment. We also are not certain about the difference in the level of inhaled nitric oxide (nitric oxide) in the oral group compared to those in the 'placebo' group. This is mainly due to the small numbers of participants in the studies. We rated the certainty of the evidence for the main outcome of AHI as low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity of the results. For the other outcomes of desaturation index and respiratory rate, we rated the quality of the data as moderate."", 'We included five studies with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to severe OA.

Two of these three studies (n = 137) used montelukast, a corticosteroid, to treat OA in boys. The other two (n > 103) used a placebo (a fake drug). We found that montleukast reduced the number of children with OSA who experienced apnoeas, hypopnoea, and respiratory arousals during sleep.

One trial found that when NB-VUBA was used with a retinoid (pregabalin) there were no differences between the groups in terms of the number of participants who had to stop treatment due to adverse events, and the withdrawals due to these events. One study found that adding NB-VAB to a skin patch (pyridoxamine) had the same benefits as using PUVA alone for treating CPP and GP. Two studies found that using NB-UA had similar results for the clearance of PPP and CPP, and for the removal of side-side-effects. The quality of the evidence for all of the outcomes was low or very low. The main reason for this was that the studies did not report all of our outcomes.', 'We included 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 662 participants. Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant-rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side-effects, and Clearance rate. In one RCT of NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP, the difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 063 to 1.32; N = 51; low quality). In three other RCTs, the clearance rates were inconsistent because in one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearances were statistically significantly higher in favour of oralPUVA. Pooled data from these three studies indicated that withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different between either group. In participants with PPP, one trial found there were no significant differences between NB and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.09, low quality), while a parallel RCT favoured bath PUVA. Two trials found that NB plus retinoid had similar effects for treating CPP or GP. Re-NB-UV and re-PUVA are similarly effective for treating people with either CPP and GP. No studies reported our primary outcomes. The evidence is very heterogeneous and needs to be interpreted with caution. In practice, NB is considered ineffective for PPP in clinical practice, since exogenous photosensitiser is not required before phototherapy.', 'We analyzed 13 studies with 662 participants and focused on participant-rated improvement, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, side-effect withdrawals, and clearance rate. One study comparing NB-UVB and oral PUVA showed no significant difference in PASI 75. Three other studies had inconsistent clearance rates. Withdrawals due to side effects were not significantly different between groups. Evidence comparing NB-UVB with bath PUVA was also inconsistent. Two studies found similar effects between NB-UVB plus retinoid and PUVA plus retinoid for treating CPP or GP. One study found no significant differences between NB']","[3, 2, 1, 0]"

Aripiprazole was compared with other drug treatments in three studies in adults—lithium was used in one study and haloperidol in two studies. No statistically significant differences between aripiprazole and other drug treatments in reducing manic symptoms were noted at three weeks (YMRS MD at three weeks (random effects) 0.07, 95% CI -1.24 to 1.37; three studies; N = 972, moderate quality evidence) or at any other time point up to and including 12 weeks.

Aripiprazole also led to more gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea (high quality evidence), and constipation) and caused more children/adolescents to have a prolactin level that fell below the lower limit of normal. Significant heterogeneity was present in the meta-analysis of movement disorders associated with aripiprazole and other treatments and was most likely due to the different side effect profiles of lithium and haloperidol. At the three-week time point, meta-analysis was not possible because of lack of data; however, at 12 weeks, haloperidol resulted in significantly more movement disorders than aripiprazole, as measured on the SAS, the BAS and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by participant-reported akathisia.

The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results of this review. With the exception of one trial, this review has not shown effectiveness for educational interventions, including advice to activate, advice on stress coping skills, workplace ergonomic skills and self care strategies. Future research should be\xa0founded on sound adult learning theory and learning skill acquisition.', ""The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of TPE strategies for adults with acute to chronic neck pain.\xa0We found three TPE themes: 1. Advice to focus on activation (e.g. a whiplash video), 2. Self-care strategies, and 3. Behavioural strategies. We found low to very low evidence that self-care methods did not relieve pain for the duration of acute to long-term neck pain at short-term follow-up. With the exception of one trial, this review has not shown effectiveness for all interventions, which are aimed at helping adults to become aware of their neck pain, such as the need to'start the day off' (i.e. changing their neck rhythm), stress-coping skills, workplace ergonomics and self care strategies. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low. The main limitations of the review were that only three of the 15 trials that we included in the analysis were of high risk of bias (that is overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).\xa0We conclude that there is a need for more research in this area.\xa0This review has shown that there are three main themes. 1. What is TPE and how might TPE help adults with neck pain? 2. How up-to-date is this review?\xa0We searched for all randomised and quasi-randomised trials that looked at TPE for adults.\xa0One of them was of high quality, while the other two were of low or very low quality.\xa0In one of the trials, the quality of evidence was very low. This means that we are uncertain about the accuracy of the results.\xa0Further research is likely to have an impact on our conclusions."", 'This review identified 15 studies that compared interventions to improve the symptoms of whiplash. Three TPE themes emerged. Advice focusing on activation: There is moderate quality (one trial, 348 people) that an advice video of advice to activate, which aims to help people to become more active, is more effective than no treatment for acute pain. There is low- to very- low- quality (nine trials, 348 adults) that a whiplASH pamphlet on how-treat-whiplash-related-worsens (WHW), which aims at helping people to use their hands to move, is less effective than a generic advice booklet for people with whiplashes. There was no difference in the effect of the WHW on pain relief, or in the effects of the pamphlet on function, when compared with no treatment. Self-care: There was low-to-very- low quality (three trials, 243 people), very-low- to low- or low-evidence that self-care strategies, such as exercise, self-cough, stress-cope, ergonomics, and self-help, did not help people with acute to long-term neck pain. Self care strategies, for example, self care advice, self help, and stress-related stress, did no more or no less than no therapy for people who had chronic neck pain, but there was no clear evidence that self care was more helpful than no therapies. With the results of one trial, this has not shown that T PE is helpful for other T PE themes.', 'Out of 15 trials, three had low bias risk and three main themes were identified. 1. Activation advice: Moderate quality evidence from one trial (348 participants) showed that an educational video on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain compared to no treatment in the intermediate-term, but not in the long-term. Low quality evidence from one trial (102 participants) suggested that a whiplash pamphlet on activation advice was less effective for pain reduction or had no difference in improving function and global perceived improvement compared to generic information given in emergency care for acute whiplash.

It is uncertain whether there is a clinically important difference between crowns and fillings in terms of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings. We are therefore uncertain about the estimates. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the hall technique. No RCT evidence was found that compared different methods of fitting preformed metal crowns. We considered outcomes reported at the dental appointment or within 24 hours of it, and in the shorter term (less than 12 months) or long term. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies: time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or following pulp treatment, are likely to be less likely to fail or have pain when compared to fillings, and may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to filling. The amount and quality of evidence for crowns compared to other dental treatments, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. One split-mouth study (11 participants) compared PMC fitted with a stainless steel veneer versus aesthetic crown. It provided very low quality evidence so no conclusions could be drawn. The evidence quality was very low and we are therefore we are uncertain about our estimates.', ""We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two studies fitted PMCs fitted with the 'Halls technique', which is a type of filling, with fillers; one of these two studies also included a third arm, which allowed the review to include a third group of studies. One of these three groups of three studies used PMCs (fitted with the Hall technique), and the other three studies (using PMCs) used PMC (fitted using the 'Hall technique') fitted with fillments. The evidence is current to September 2014. The review found that crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions, or after pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. There was moderate quality evidence that the risk was lower in the crowns group in the longer term (three studies, one conventional and two using the Hall Technique). Similarly, there was moderate evidence that pain was lower for the crown group (two studies, 312 teeth). There was no evidence that there was a difference in the risk for gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings, either in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between the risk and the risk associated with gingiolei (gingsival bleeding) bleeding when crowns are fitted with a Hall technique. The quality of evidence for crowns compared to non-restorative caries treatment, and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns, is very low. There are no RCTs comparing crowns fitted conventionally versus using the technique of the Hall Techniques. There is no evidence comparing crowning with fillens. The studies were of low quality.""]","[0, 2, 1, 3]"
448,"A total of 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) were included in the review; 18 studies involving 296 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta-analysis. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece was used. These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage (AD), oral oscillating PEP devices, high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and BiPaP and exercise. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants). Single interventions or series of treatments that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence). However, long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence). A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderate- to high-quality evidence). In one of the included studies which used PEP with a mouthpiece, it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, low-quality evidence). Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high-quality evidence; only very low- to moderate-quality evidence was available for other outcomes. There was limited evidence reported on adverse events; these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events. In a study where infants performing either PEP or PDPV experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, low-quality evidence). In PEP versus oscillating PEP, adverse events were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness, which improved after further instructions on device use was provided) (22 participants, low-quality evidence). In PEP versus HFCWO, from one long-term high-quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events; however, those in the PEP group had fewer adverse events related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (high-certainty evidence). Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures. The evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and devices described may have a place in the clinical treatment of people with CF. Following meta-analyses of the effects of PEP versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was high-quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations when PEP using a mask was compared with HFCWO. It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms and lung function. This also applies as conditions vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations.","We included 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) in this review.

We found low quality of data for the other outcomes (adverse effects, death from any cause, lung or circulatory problems, cognitive problems, length of stay or costs), all of which we did not include in the review. The quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre and did not describe their methods well.', 'We included three studies involving 170 participants. All included participants were male and were undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopical radical prostatectomies. The men were between 50 and 75 years of age. The evidence is up to date to January 2015. We found evidence showing no differences in pain between the two types of anaesthetics. We also found evidence that propofol reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery compared with sevoflurane. We did not find evidence that either anaesthetic technique was superior to the other. We identified one ongoing trial. We are uncertain whether the anaesthetic techniques are superior to each other in preventing eye complications. We have found low-quality evidence suggesting that prop ofol may prevent an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) after pneumoperitoneum and steep Trendelenburg positioning compared with a decrease in IOP after sev ofluranes. However, it is unclear whether this translates directly to clinical avoidance of ocular complications during surgery. No studies addressed the secondary outcomes of adverse effects, all-cause mortality, respiratory or circulatory complications, cognitive dysfunction, length of stay or costs. Overall the quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre trials providing unclear descriptions of methods. It is unclear which anaesthetic is superior - TIVA or inhalational - for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery in urology, gynaecology and gastroenterology, as existing evidence is scarce, is of low quality and has been generated from exclusively male patients undergoing robotic radical prostateectomy. An ongoing trial, which includes participants of both genders with a focus on quality of recovery, might have an impact on future evidence related to this topic.', ""We analyzed three studies with 170 male participants undergoing robotic prostate surgery. The results showed no significant difference in postoperative pain between the two types of anesthesia. However, propofol may reduce short-term nausea and vomiting and prevent increased eye pressure during surgery compared to inhaled anesthesia. The overall quality of evidence is low, and it's unclear which anesthesia technique is better for robotic surgeries in urology, gynecology, and gastroenterology.

We conducted stratified analyses of mild or moderate potency, and potent or very potent topical corticosteroids, but we found no causal associations between maternal exposure to topical corticosteroid of any potency and congenital abnormality, orofacial clefts, preterm delivery, or low Apgar score. For low birth weight, although the meta-analysis based on study-level data was not significant for either mild to moderate corticosteroids (pooled RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09, 3 cohort studies, n > 55,713) or potent to very potent corticosteroids (pooled RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.58, 4 cohort studies, n > 47,651), there were significant differences between the two subgroups (P = 0.04). The results from three of the individual studies in the meta-analysis indicated an increased risk of low birth weight in women who received potent to very potent topical corticosteroids. Maternal use of mild to moderate potency topical steroids was associated with a decreased risk of foetal death (pooled RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.77, 2 studies, n = 48,749; low quality evidence), but we did not observe this effect when potent to very potent topical corticosteroids were given during pregnancy (pooled RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.88, 3 studies, n = 37,086, low quality evidence). We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. Data from observational studies started at low quality. We further downgraded the evidence because of imprecision in low birth weight and inconsistency in foetal death. Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes. This update adds more evidence showing no causal associations between maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids of all potencies and pregnancy outcomes including mode of delivery, congenital abnormalities, preterm delivery, foetal death, and low Apgar score, which is consistent with the previous version of this review. This update provides stratified analyses based on steroid potency; we found no association between maternal use of topical corticosteroids of any potency and an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including mode of delivery, congenital abnormality, preterm delivery, foetal death, and low Apgar score. Similar to the previous version of the review, this update identified a probable association between low birth weight and maternal use of potent to very potent topical corticosteroids, especially when the cumulative dosage of topical corticosteroids throughout the pregnancy is very large, which warrants further investigation. The finding of a possible protective effect of mild to moderate topical corticosteroids on foetal death could also be examined.","We included 14 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1,601,515 study participants.

460,"We found four RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT). All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid and without topical corticosteroid and had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year. These trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa. All trials reported data on visual acuity ranging from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any important difference between the corticosteroid group and the control group.

Some trials included co-interventions that are unlikely to be found in normal day care centres. Comparisons might include home visits or alternative day care arrangements that provide special attention to children from low-income families while exploring possible mechanisms of effect. The need for such studies is significant."", ""We searched for evidence on 15 January 2016 and found one study, involving 120 families and 143 children. The study was conducted in the UK, and compared centre-based day care with no treatment (care at home) for children younger than five years of age and their families in high-income countries. The children were followed up for three years. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found no evidence that centre- based day care improved or worsened children's cognitive ability or psychosocial development. No other measures of child intellectual or psycho-development were reported in the included study. Moreover, no evidence indicated that centre care improved employment of parents, as measured by the number of mothers in full-time or part-time employment or maternal hours per week in paid employment. The included study did not report on long-term outcomes for children (high-school completion or income). The quality of the evidence was very low. The main limitations of the review were the small number of studies and participants, and the fact that some studies included co-interventions that are unlikely to be found in normal day care centres. We therefore recommend that future studies of centre--based care for children and their parents should be conducted to assess the effects of day care for disadvantaged children. Comparisons might include home visits or alternative day care arrangements that provide special attention to children from low-income families while exploring possible mechanisms of effect."", ""In a review of one study with 120 families and 143 children, there was no clear evidence that center-based day care improved children's cognitive or psychosocial development, or parents' employment and income. The study had a high risk of bias and did not report long-term outcomes for children. The review cannot provide strong guidance on the effects of day care based on this limited evidence. More studies are needed to compare different day care options and their effects on children and families.""]","[2, 1, 3, 0]"

However, there was an increase in the risk of death from any cause (all-cause mortality) in patients treated with the drug, compared to placebo, but the increase was not significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.33 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.08)). There is also a clear increase in risk of mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. The confidence interval for patients who were taking inhaled steroids is wide and cannot rule in or out an increase of asthma mortality in the presence of an inhaled steroid. Although the increase in deaths was smaller in patients taking inhalers at baseline, the confidence interval is wide, so we cannot conclude that the inhalers abolish the risks of the drug. In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious side effects. One extra serious side effect occurred over 28 weeks for every 188 people treated with regular Salmeterol compared with placebo. There is insufficient evidence to assess whether the risk in children is higher or lower than in adults. The adverse effects in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied.', ""The text discusses a review of 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing it to salbutamol, involving 62,815 participants with asthma, including 2,599 children. In six trials, no serious adverse event data was available. All-cause mortality was slightly higher with regular salmeterol than placebo, but not significantly.

Only 19% of people with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiogram, are cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days (evidence from three trials). Only 3% of those with acute sinusitis will have a brain abscess (brain abscess) one week after taking antibiotics. Side effects (such as rash, pain, and headache) are the most frequent outcome (13% with antibiotics, 10% with placebo, 12% with no treatment). We found no serious side effects (e.g. nose bleeds) with antibiotics. We could not draw conclusions about children, those with suppressed immune systems, or those with very severe sininusitis. We do not know if antibiotics are useful for these patients. We judged the risk of bias in the trials to be low to very low (low risk of systematic error, high risk of random error, low risk of play of chance, high quality of evidence).', 'We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 were from our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are from the two reviews we included. No new studies were included from searches for this update. The evidence is current to January 2017. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Australia. The mean age of participants was between 55 and 65 years. The duration of the trials ranged from one week to 14 days. The studies were conducted between 1980 and 2015. The review found that antibiotics shorten the time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment. Five fewer people per cent of people will experience clinical failure if they are treated with antibiotics instead or placebo or placebo. The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (moderate-quality data) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was high for the outcomes of clinical diagnosis and imaging. The overall quality of evidence was moderate for the outcome of clinical cure and for the other outcomes of adverse events. The main limitations of the included trials were the small number of participants and the small numbers of participants with serious complications. The included trials did not include children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.', 'This text discusses a study involving 15 trials with 3057 participants, examining the effects of antibiotics on rhinosinusitis. The results show that antibiotics can slightly speed up recovery, but only a small percentage of people will benefit from this. Antibiotics also come with a higher risk of side effects compared to placebo or no treatment. The study concludes that antibiotics are not necessary for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis, considering the risks and antibiotic resistance. The study does not cover children, people with suppressed immune systems, or those with severe sinusitis, as they were not included in the available trials.']","[1, 2, 3, 0]"

Analysis was split into three comparisons: (1) Tai Chi versus usual care; (2)Tai Chi and breathing exercise versus breathing exercise alone; and (3) Taichi and exercise versus exercise alone. Tai Chi demonstrated a longer six-minute walk distance (mean difference (MD) 29.64 metres, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10.52 to 48.77 metres; participants = 318; I2 = 59%) and better pulmonary function in post-programme data. When Tai Chi in addition to other interventions was compared with other interventions alone, Tai Chi did not show superiority and showed no additional effects on symptoms nor on physical and psychosocial function improvement in people with COPD. No adverse events were reported, implying that Tai Chi is safe to practise. However, the effects of Tai Chi on reducing dyspnoea level and improving quality of life remain inconclusive. Quality of evidence of the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. Evidence of very low quality suggests better functional capacity and pulmonary function for Tai Chi when compared with usual care. When comparing Tai Chi plus breathing exercise or exercise versus other interventions shows no superiority and no additional effect on symptom improvement nor on psychological and physical and social outcomes with Tai Chi. Data are currently insufficient for evaluating the impact on maximal exercise capacity, balance and muscle strength. Hence, future studies are warranted to address these topics. With the diverse style and number of forms being adopted in different studies, the most beneficial protocol of the Tai Chi style could not be commented upon.', 'We included 12 studies with 984 participants from 23 references in this review. The studies lasted for six weeks to one year. The age of participants ranged from 10 to 206, and mean age ranged from 61 to 74 years. All studies were conducted in the USA. The evidence is current to January 2015. We included only those involved in Tai Chi and the control group (i.e. 811 participants) in the final analysis. We found that Tai Chi improved functional capacity and pulmonary function in people with COPD. However, the effects of Tai Chi on reducing dyspnoea level and improving quality of life remain inconclusive. No adverse events were reported. When Tai Chi was compared with other interventions (i) alone, Tai Chi did not show any additional effects on symptoms nor on physical and psychosocial function improvement in people. No side effects were reported, suggesting that Taichi is safe to practise in people who have COPD and no side effects are reported. The quality of evidence of the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of the evidence were the small study sizes and the fact that the studies were not blinded.', 'We included a total of 984 adults with COPD aged 61 to 74 years old in this update of the review. Tai Chi was used for six weeks to one year and was compared with a range of treatments (e.g. usual care), no treatment, or any other intervention. We found that Tai Chi does not seem to improve symptoms or quality of life in COPD. We are not able to draw conclusions about the use of Tai Chi in reducing dyspnoea (shortness of breath), as the quality of evidence was very low to moderate. No side effects from Tai Chi were found in any of the comparisons. No adverse events were reported in the studies. We would not be able to conclude whether or not Tai Chi is a good treatment for COPD due to the lack of data. However, we did find that when compared with usual care, Tai Chi demonstrated a longer six-minute walk distance (mean of 29.64 metres) and better lung function (i.e. forced expiratory volume in one second (MD) 0.02 to 0.20 L) in the post-programme data. We do not know if Tai Chi improves symptoms, balance and muscle strength in the short-term or long-term. When compared with other interventions, we found that when we added Tai Chi to other treatments (breathing therapy) Tai Chi did not show superiority and showed no effect on symptoms nor on physical and psychosocial function improvement. We judged the evidence to be very low quality.']","[0, 1, 3, 2]"
478,"We included 72 trials that involved 2470 participants. This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the studies included in the previous version of this review. Study sample sizes were generally small and interventions varied in terms of both the goals of treatment and the virtual reality devices used. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system. Control groups usually received no intervention or therapy based on a standard-care approach. Primary outcome: results were not statistically significant for upper limb function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.05 to 0.20, 22 studies, 1038 participants, low-quality evidence) when comparing virtual reality to conventional therapy. However, when virtual reality was used in addition to usual care (providing a higher dose of therapy for those in the intervention group) there was a statistically significant difference between groups (SMD 0.49, 0.21 to 0.77, 10 studies, 210 participants, low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes: when compared to conventional therapy approaches there were no statistically significant effects for gait speed or balance. Results were statistically significant for the activities of daily living (ADL) outcome (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43, 10 studies, 466 participants, moderate-quality evidence); however, we were unable to pool results for cognitive function, participation restriction, or quality of life. Twenty-three studies reported that they monitored for adverse events; across these studies there were few adverse events and those reported were relatively mild. We found evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming was not more beneficial than conventional therapy approaches in improving upper limb function. Virtual reality may be beneficial in improving upper limb function and activities of daily living function when used as an adjunct to usual care (to increase overall therapy time). There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation, or quality of life. This review found that time since onset of stroke, severity of impairment, and the type of device (commercial or customised) were not strong influencers of outcome. There was a trend suggesting that higher dose (more than 15 hours of total intervention) was preferable as were customised virtual reality programs; however, these findings were not statistically significant.","We included 72 trials that involved 2470 participants.

The age range of the participants ranged from 18 to 77 years. Most of the people in the trials had had a stroke more than a year ago. The studies we found were of low or very low quality. We found that there were few side-effects from the use of the devices. The most common side effects were mild (such as pain, tingling in the leg) and pain in the arm. The quality of the evidence for each of the main outcomes ranged from low to very low. The main reason for this was that many of the trials did not report enough details about their methodology or how they were conducted. Thus, while there are a large number of studies in this field, the evidence in this review is mostly low.', 'This text discusses a review of 72 trials with 2470 participants, which includes 35 new studies.
