    <h4>Original</h4>
    <p>The review includes 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing with salbutamol. These included 62,815 participants with asthma (including 2,599 children). In six trials (2,766 patients), no serious adverse event data could be obtained. All-cause mortality was higher with regular salmeterol than placebo but the increase was not significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.33 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.08)). Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased when regular salmeterol was compared with placebo (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.02 to 1.29). One extra serious adverse event occurred over 28 weeks for every 188 people treated with regular salmeterol (95% CI 95 to 2606). There is insufficient evidence to assess whether the risk in children is higher or lower than in adults. We found no significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events when regular salmeterol was compared with regular salbutamol. We combined individual patient data from the two largest studies (SNS: n=25,180 and SMART: n=26,355), as all the asthma-related deaths in adults occurred in these studies. In patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, compared to regular salbutamol or placebo, there was a significant increase in risk of asthma-related death with regular salmeterol (Peto OR 6.15 95% CI 1.73 to 21.84). The confidence interval for patients who were taking inhaled corticosteroids is wide and cannot rule in or out an increase in asthma mortality in the presence of an inhaled corticosteroid (Peto OR 2.03 95% CI 0.82 to 5.00). In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular salmeterol. There is also a clear increase in risk of asthma-related mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. Although the increase in asthma-related mortality was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids at baseline, the confidence interval is wide, so we cannot conclude that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol. The adverse effects of regular salmeterol in children remain uncertain due to the small number of children studied.</p>

There was also a clear increase in the risk of death from asthma in patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. We combined the data from the two largest studies (25,180 and 26,355 participants) as all the asthma--related deaths in adults occurred in these studies. In patients who did not take inhaled steroids, compared to patients taking regular salmetamol or placebo, there was an increase in risk of dying from asthma related to any cause. The confidence interval for this result is wide and we cannot rule in or out an increase of asthma deaths in the presence of an inhaled steroid. We cannot conclude that the use of regular salmeterot reduces the risks of asthma in children due to the small number of children studied.</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We found 26 studies (62,815 adults and 2,599 children) that compared salmeterol to placebo and eight studies (2,074 adults) that looked at salbutamol. We found that people who were not taking an inhaled corticosteroid were at significantly higher risk of death from any cause than those who were. There was no difference in the number of people who had a non-fatal event (such as a heart attack) or serious side effects with the inhaled steroids compared with the placebo. There were no differences in the numbers of patients who experienced a serious side effect with the steroids compared to those who did not. We were not able to combine data from the two largest studies (25,180 adults and 26,355 children) as all the deaths in adults were in the control group and we could not obtain all-cause deaths (i.e. death due to any cause). There was a clear increase in the risk of having a serious adverse event with regular salmetamol when compared to placebo. This was the case in both adults and children. We also found that there was an increased risk of serious adverse events with the regular salmyol group compared to the placebo group. We are unable to say whether the risk in children is higher or lower than in adults. There is not enough evidence to say which inhaled steroid is the best to use.</li>

In six trials (2.766 patients), no serious adverse events data could be obtained. We found no significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse event rates when regular salmeterol was compared with regular salbutamic acid. There was an increase in the risk of asthma-related death with regular Salmeterol compared to placebo. There is also an increase of asthma deaths in patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. We cannot be sure whether regular salmetamol is better than placebo for reducing the risk for asthma- related deaths. There were no serious side effects of regular salmyol in children. The risk of serious side effect in children remains uncertain due to the small number of children studied. We combined the results of two large studies (26,355 participants) as all the asthma--related deaths in adults occurred in these studies. In patients who were not taking an inhaled steroid, compared to regular sal butamol or placebo, there was an increased risk of death from asthma. The confidence interval for patients who are taking an inhaler was wide and we cannot rule out an increase for asthma deaths. We have found an increased number of serious adverse effects with regular treatment with salmeterolin compared to a placebo. We are uncertain whether regular treatment is better or worse than taking an asthma inhaler.</li>

We combined individual patient data from the two largest studies (SNS: 25,180 and SMART: 26,355), as all the asthma-related deaths in adults occurred in these studies. We found no significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events when the two drugs were compared with each other. However, there was an increase in the risk of death from any cause (all-cause mortality) in patients treated with the drug, compared to placebo, but the increase was not significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.33 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.08)). There is also a clear increase in risk of mortality in patients not using inhaled corticosteroids in the two large surveillance studies. The confidence interval for patients who were taking inhaled steroids is wide and cannot rule in or out an increase of asthma mortality in the presence of an inhaled steroid. Although the increase in deaths was smaller in patients taking inhalers at baseline, the confidence interval is wide, so we cannot conclude that the inhalers abolish the risks of the drug. In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious side effects. One extra serious side effect occurred over 28 weeks for every 188 people treated with regular Salmeterol compared with placebo.

    <h4>Original</h4>
    <p>Six trials were identified, with 425 patients randomized to D-penicillamine and 258 to placebo. A statistically significant benefit was observed for D-penicillamine when compared to placebo for all three-dose ranges and for most outcome measures including: tender joint counts, pain, physician's global assessments and ESR. The standardized weighted mean differences between treatment and placebo in moderate doses were -0.51 [95% CI -0.88, -0.14] for tender joint counts, -0.56 (95% CI -0.87, -0.26) for pain and -0.97 (95% CI -1.25, -0.70) for global assessment. The difference for ESR was -10.6 mm/hr. Similar results were observed for the higher dose group. Total withdrawals were significantly higher in the moderate and high dosage D-penicillamine groups (OR=1.63 and 2.13 respectively), mostly due to increased adverse reactions (OR = 2.60 and 4.95 respectively), including renal and hematological abnormalities. D-penicillamine appears to have a clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Its efficacy appears to be similar to that of other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but with a significantly higher toxicity. Its effects on long-term functional status and radiological progression are not clear from this review.</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> Six trials with 425 patients on D-penicillamine and 258 on placebo were found. D-penicillamine showed significant benefits in reducing joint pain, overall pain, and inflammation compared to placebo. However, more people withdrew from the study due to side effects, including kidney and blood issues. D-penicillamine seems effective for rheumatoid arthritis, but has higher toxicity than other similar drugs. Its long-term effects are still unclear.</li>

    <h4>Original</h4>
    <p>We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had low risk of attrition bias. Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduced fatigue (pooled SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.20; 11 studies, 883 participants) and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term (pooled SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; six studies, 657 participants). The funnel plot for health-related quality of life was asymmetrical, favouring no therapy, and the funnel plot for fatigue was roughly symmetrical. This hints at overall low risk of publication bias. Yoga did not appear to reduce depression (pooled SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.05; seven studies, 496 participants; low-quality evidence) or anxiety (pooled SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.04; six studies, 346 participants; very low-quality evidence) in the short term and had no medium-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.42; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.29; two studies, 146 participants; low-quality evidence). Investigators reported no serious adverse events. Four studies that compared yoga versus psychosocial/educational interventions provided moderate-quality evidence indicating that yoga can reduce depression (pooled SMD -2.29, 95% CI -3.97 to -0.61; four studies, 226 participants), anxiety (pooled SMD -2.21, 95% CI -3.90 to -0.52; three studies, 195 participants) and fatigue (pooled SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.50; two studies, 106 participants) in the short term. Very low-quality evidence showed no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD 0.81, 95% CI -0.50 to 2.12; two studies, 153 participants) or sleep disturbances (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.34; two studies, 119 participants). No trial adequately reported safety-related data. Three studies that compared yoga versus exercise presented very low-quality evidence showing no short-term effects on health-related quality of life (pooled SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.23; three studies, 233 participants) or fatigue (pooled SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.25; three studies, 233 participants); no trial provided safety-related data. Moderate-quality evidence supports the recommendation of yoga as a supportive intervention for improving health-related quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances when compared with no therapy, as well as for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue, when compared with psychosocial/educational interventions. Very low-quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes.</p>

No study provided information on safety. Three studies compared yoga with exercise compared with no exercise. Evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes. Investigators reported no serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the results.</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants. The evidence is current to January 2015. The review found that yoga can improve health-related quality of life and reduce fatigue and sleep disturbances when compared with no therapy, as well as for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue, when compared to psychosocial/educational interventions. Yoga did not appear to reduce depression, sleep disturbances or anxiety in the short term. Yoga might be as effective as other exercise programmes and might be used as an alternative to other exercise. No serious adverse events were reported. The quality of the evidence was moderate for yoga versus no therapy and very low for yoga compared with psychosomatic interventions. The results of the review suggest that yoga might be an effective supportive intervention for improving health- related quality oflife and reducing fatigue and night-time sleep disturbances, as a supportive intervention when compared against no therapy. However, the quality of evidence was very low or low for other outcomes. The included studies did not adequately report safety-related data. The overall quality of this evidence was low or very low. The main limitations of the studies were the small number of participants and the small numbers of studies.</li>
<li><b>Model 1:</b> We found 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants. Yoga was used in a range of positions (e.g. on the back, knee, back, back or both) and was compared with no therapy, or a psychosocial/educative treatment (where yoga is taught to change stress levels in a non-judgemental way), or exercise, or both. The evidence is up-to-date as of 19 February 2019. Yoga appears to be as good as no treatment for improving health-related quality of life, reducing tiredness and fatigue and anxiety and fatigue in the short-term. Yoga does not seem to be effective for the long-term, although it is not known if it is as effective as other treatments such as exercise. We do not know if yoga is better than other interventions such as weight-bearing or biofeedback. We did not find any studies that looked at the safety of yoga. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. The main reasons for downgrades were that we did not have a high risk of bias (i.e. there was a high chance of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of the way the studies were designed and performed) and that many of the people in the study groups did not complete the study.</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We analyzed 24 studies with 2166 participants, and found that yoga can improve health-related quality of life, reduce fatigue, and decrease sleep disturbances compared to no therapy. It can also reduce depression, anxiety, and fatigue compared to psychosocial/educational interventions. However, yoga may not be more effective than other exercise programs. Overall, yoga is a recommended supportive intervention for improving health and well-being.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had no attrition bias. Moderate-quality evidence showed that yoga improved health-related quality of life (10 studies, 675 participants), reduced fatigue (11 studies, 883 participants) and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term. Yoga did not appear to reduce depression (seven studies, 496 participants), anxiety (three studies, 195 participants) or fatigue (two studies, 146 participants). Three studies that compared yoga versus exercise showed no short-term effects on health- related quality of lives or fatigue or sleep disturbances. Very low-quality quality evidence showed no effect of yoga on depression, anxiety or fatigue. No trial adequately reported safety-related data. Four studies comparing yoga versus psychosocial/educational interventions provided moderate- quality evidence indicating that yoga can reduce depression and anxiety (four studies, 226 participants), fatigue and sleep disturbances (Two studies, 106 participants). Very low quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions and might be used as an alternative to other exercise programmes. Investigators reported no serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.</li>

    <p>We found nine eligible RCTs including 593 infants in total. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants. Meta-analyses, although limited by data quality and availability, suggest that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain (MD −1.36, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.29 g/kg/day), and provide some evidence that responsive feeding reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding (MD −5.53, 95% CI −6.80 to −4.25 days). GRADE assessments indicated low quality of evidence. The importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the duration of hospitalisation. None of the included trials reported any parent, caregiver, or staff views. Overall, the data do not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Some (low quality) evidence exists that preterm infants fed in response to feeding and satiation cues achieve full oral feeding earlier than infants fed prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals. This finding should be interpreted cautiously because of methodological weaknesses in the included trials. A large RCT would be needed to confirm this finding and to determine if responsive feeding of preterm infants affects other important outcomes.</p>

<li><b>Model 1:</b> We found nine studies with 593 infants comparing responsive and scheduled feeding in preterm infants transitioning from tube to oral feeding. The studies had some weaknesses and limited data quality. Results suggest that responsive feeding may lead to slightly slower weight gain and faster transition to oral feeding, but the evidence is of low quality. The impact of this finding is unclear, as there was no strong effect on hospital stay duration. No parent or caregiver opinions were reported. Overall, there is no strong evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Some low-quality evidence suggests that responsive feeding may help infants reach full oral feeding sooner. However,</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We found nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 593 preterm babies. We found that some (but not all) RCTs showed a trend to a faster rate of weight gain in preterm infants who had been on an intagastric tube compared with those who had received a normal feed. We did not find strong (or consistent) evidence that the rate of growth or development of preterm children who had responded to a restart of their own feeding was different from those who did not. We are uncertain as to whether this is the case as the quality of the evidence was low. We identified a need for a large RCT to confirm this finding and to find out if the rates of growth and development of these preterm newborns are the same as those who are not. None of the trials reported any parent, caregiver, or staff views. Overall, we do not have strong (if any) results for the primary outcomes of this review.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> We found nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 593 infants. These trials compared responsive feeding with scheduled interval regimens in pre term infants in the phase from intragastric tube to oral feeds. The trials were small, and the trials were of poor quality. The findings of this review are based on low- to very- low- quality data. We found that feeding in the response to feeds and cues can help pre term pre term babies to eat more food and drink more fluids. The results of the trials did, however, show that the babies who fed in the same way as the infants fed at scheduled times have a slightly slower rate (1.36 g/ kg/day), and some of these babies may be fed earlier (5.53 days) than infants fed prescribed volumes at scheduled intervals. The evidence is up to date as of January 2015. The quality of the evidence was low. The included trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the duration of hospitalisation.

    <h4>Original</h4>
    <p>The review contains only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with a mean age of 57.3 (standard deviation 11.6) years in the placebo group. This trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with a dose of placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events. There was very low-certainty evidence on the relative effect of oxandrolone on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (risk ratio RR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.26) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, we are uncertain whether oxandrolone improves or reduces the complete healing of pressure ulcers, as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. There was low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 3.85, 95% CI 1.12 to 13.26) (downgraded once for imprecision and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, the treatment with oxandrolone may increase the risk of non-serious adverse events reported in participants. There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandrolone compared with placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.17) (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% CI, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Of the five serious adverse events reported in the oxandrolone-treated group, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. We are uncertain whether oxandrolone increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events as we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. Secondary outcomes such as pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life were not reported in the included trial. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality (downgraded for imprecision and indirectness). This trial stopped early when the futility analysis (interim analysis) in the opinion of the study authors showed that oxandrolone had no benefit over placebo for improving ulcer healing. There is no high quality evidence to support the use of anabolic steroids in treating pressure ulcers. Further well-designed, multicenter trials, at low risk of bias, are necessary to assess the effect of anabolic steroids on treating pressure ulcers, but careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research.</p>

    <p>We found only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with an average age of 57.3 (standard range 11.6 to 58.6) years) in the placebo group. This trial compared anabolic steroids (20 mg/day, administered orally) with placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events. There was very low-certainty evidence on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% confidence interval (CI) range, which spanned both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spine cord injury patients). Thus, we are uncertain whether the use of anabolic corticosteroids improves or reduces the complete healing. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low due to the small number of participants included in the trial and the wide range of results. We are also uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events reported in participants treated with anabolic steroid compared with placebo, as none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. The trial stopped early when the futility analysis (interim analysis) of the study authors showed no benefit over placebo for the treatment. There were no data on pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life. Overall the evidence in this study was of very low quality. This means that we have very limited confidence in the results. Further well-designed, multicenter trials, at low risk of bias, are necessary.</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We searched for evidence on the effects of anabolic steroids on the healing of pressure ulcers in adults. We found only one trial with a total of 212 people. The trial compared oxandrolone (20 mg/day, orally) with a dummy (fake) drug (placebo), which was an active substance (a substance containing 98%, 2%, and 2% of a substance called a protein that looks like starch) and an anabolite (a drug that looks and acts like a mineral) and a dummy. The study was stopped early when the futile analysis (interim analysis), in the view of the study authors, did not show that oxandolone was better than dummy for ulcer-healing. We are not sure if oxandolin increases or decreases the risk of serious adverse events. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low. There was very low-certainty evidence on complete ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period (downgraded twice for imprecision due to an extremely wide 95% confidence interval (CI) of both benefit and harm, and once for indirectness, as the participants were mostly male spinal cord injury patients). Thus, we are uncertain whether oxandrinone improves or reduces the complete healing of ulcers, as we assessed the evidence on this outcome as very uncertain. There is low-quality evidence on non-serious adverse events reported in participants treated with oxandroleone compared with placebo (downgrading once for imp recurrence and once as indirectness). Thus we are not certain whether oxanrolone increases or reduces non-significant adverse events, as there was no difference between the two groups. There were no serious adverse effects reported in the oxandolan-treated group. We were unable to assess pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life. Overall the</li>
<li><b>Model 1:</b> The evidence is current to February 2019. We found only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 (standard deviation 10.4) years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) with an average age of 57.3 (standard standard deviation 11.6) years. The trial compared ox androlone (20 mg/day, administered orally) with placebo (an inactive substance consisting of 98% starch and 2% magnesium stearate) and reported data on complete healing of ulcers and adverse events. This trial stopped early when the futility analysis (interim analysis) in the opinion of the study authors showed that oxandolone had no benefit over placebo for improving ulcer healing at the end of a 24-week treatment period. There was very low-certainty evidence on the risk of non-serious adverse events (non-serious side effects) reported in participants treated with oxandolinone compared with placebo. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low due to the small number of participants in the included trial and the fact that the participants were mostly male. Thus, we are uncertain whether the use of anabolic steroids improves or reduces the total healing of the ulcers. We are also uncertain whether anabolic steroid treatment increases or decreases the number of serious side effects reported in the participants. The evidence in this study was of very low quality (downgraded for imprecision and indirectness). Of the five serious adverse events reported, none were classed by the trial teams as being related to treatment. There is no high quality evidence from this trial to support or refute the use in the treatment of steroids in the management of pressure ulcer. Further well-designed, multicenter trials, at low risk of bias, are necessary to assess the effect of steroids on treating pressure Ulcers, but careful consideration of the current trial and its early termination are required when planning future research. Secondary outcomes such as pain, length of hospital stay, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of different type of infection, cost of treatment, quality of treatment and quality of life were not reported in this trial. Overall the evidence was of low quality.</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We searched for all randomised trials that compared the effectiveness of oxandrolone (20 mg/day) with a placebo (sugar pill) in treating pressure ulcers. We found only one trial with a total of 212 participants. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108). They were all male (100%, 104/104) and had a mean age of 57.3 years. The study was stopped early when the results of the study were reported. We are uncertain about the use of anabolic steroids in the prevention of ulcers healing due to the quality of the evidence. There was very low-certainty data on complete ulcer healing at the end of 24-week follow-up. This means that we are not able to be certain that the use is effective in preventing ulcers healed. There were low-quality data on the risk of non-serious adverse events, such as pain, length of stay in hospital, change in wound size or wound surface area, incidence of one type of infection, cost of treatment and quality of life. The quality of evidence in this review is very low. There is a need for more research in this area.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> The text discusses a study with 212 participants who had spinal cord injuries and severe pressure ulcers. Most participants were male, with an average age of around 58 years. The study compared the effects of oxandrolone, a medication, with a placebo on ulcer healing and side effects. The results were uncertain, as the evidence was of very low quality. It was unclear whether oxandrolone improved or worsened ulcer healing, and if it increased or decreased the risk of serious side effects. The study did not report on secondary outcomes like pain, hospital stay, wound size, infection, treatment cost, or quality of life.</li>

    <h1>Report 1</h1>
    <h4>Original</h4>
    <p>We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. Types of surgery included ear, nose or throat surgery, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy, hip joint replacement surgery, knee joint replacement surgery, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy, thyroid surgery, elective caesarean section, and laparoscopic surgery. Racemic ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions 2 to 5 µg/kg/minute; 10 studies used only S-ketamine and one only R-ketamine. Risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size; most had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis. Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents (95% CI 6 to 9; 19% from 42 mg consumed by participants given placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 65 studies, 4004 participants). Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (95% CI 10 to 15; 19% from 67 mg with placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 37 studies, 2449 participants). Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced pain at rest at 24 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (95% CI 4 to 7; 19% lower from 26/100 mm with placebo, high-quality evidence; 82 studies, 5004 participants), and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm (95% CI 3 to 7; 22% lower from 23/100 mm, high-quality evidence; 49 studies, 2962 participants). Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours (6/100 mm, 14% lower from 42/100 mm, moderate-quality evidence; 29 studies, 1806 participants), and 48 hours (6/100 mm, 16% lower from 37 mm, low-quality evidence; 23 studies, 1353 participants). Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity. No analysis by dose was possible. There was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small-study effects likely but testing not possible. Ketamine increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request by 54 minutes (95% CI 37 to 71 minutes), from a mean of 39 minutes with placebo (moderate-quality evidence; 31 studies, 1678 participants). Ketamine reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia by 7 cm² (95% CI −11.9 to −2.2), compared with placebo (very low-quality evidence; 7 studies 333 participants). We downgraded the quality of evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400. CNS adverse events occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse events. Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4; high-quality evidence; 105 studies, 6538 participants). Ketamine reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting from 27% with placebo to 23% with ketamine (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96; the number needed to treat to prevent one episode of postoperative nausea and vomiting with perioperative intravenous ketamine administration was 24 (95% CI 16 to 54; high-quality evidence; 95 studies, 5965 participants). Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain intensity. Results were consistent in different operation types or timing of ketamine administration, with larger and smaller studies, and by higher and lower pain intensity. CNS adverse events were little different with ketamine or control. Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small extent, of arguable clinical relevance.</p>

    <p>We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis. Most studies had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses. Types of surgery included ear, nose or throat surgery, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy, hip joint replacement surgery, knee joint replacements surgery, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy (surgery to remove part of the prostate), thyroid surgery, elective caesarean section, and laparoscopic surgery. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. Racemic ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions 2 to 5 µg/kg/minute; 10 studies used only S-ketamine and one only R.ketamine. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400. Risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size, most of which was small. We found evidence that intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents. Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (moderate-quality evidence). Ketamine reduced pain at rest by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale. Pain during movement was reduced by 14% at 24 hours, and by 16% at 48 hours. Pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity, were consistent. No analysis by dose was possible. There was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event. The quality of evidence was high for pain reduction at rest and pain during movement, and high for reduction in postoperative nausea and vomiting, and moderate for reduction of postoperative hyperalgesia (low for nausea and dizziness). Side effects occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse events. The evidence was of high quality for pain relief at rest, pain at movement, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. We rated the quality as moderate or very low for postoperative pain relief. The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and differences between studies.</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. The evidence is current to August 2018. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis. We found that intravenous ketamine reduced pain at rest and pain during movement by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (a scale that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 0 to 100 mm) and reduced pain by 16% at 24 hours and by 5% at 48 hours. We also found that ketamine reduces pain by 8 mg morphine equivalent over 24 hours, and reduces opioid consumption by 13 mg. We were able to combine the results of 65 studies, which showed that intravenously administered ketamine was effective in reducing pain by 19% to 19% more than placebo (a dummy pill). We found evidence that intravenial ketamine is effective in decreasing pain at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, and reducing pain during movements by 14% to 16% (moderate-quality evidence). We did find evidence that ketamines reduced nausea and vomiting after surgery by 23% to 27% (high-quality and moderate-quality results, respectively). We were unable to analyse the effects of ketamines on the number of people who experienced CNS (neck and neck) adverse events. We downgraded the quality of the evidence because of small-study effects or because the number was too small. We rated the quality as high for pain at the rest of the operation, moderate for pain during the operation and pain at 48 and 24 hours after the operation (high for pain), and very low for nausea and nausea after the surgery (moderate quality evidence). The quality of evidence was downgraded because of the small number of studies and participants, and because the studies were too small to detect differences between studies.</li>

Ketamine reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia by 7 cm² compared with placebo (10 studies, 333 participants). Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4). Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours, and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (high quality evidence; 82 studies, 5004 participants), and by 16% lower from 37 mm (low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small study effects likely but testing not possible. The quality of evidence was moderate for pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity. Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain during movement, and pain was reduced by 14% and 16% respectively at 24 and 48 hours (low and moderate quality evidence) and by 6 and 100 mm (moderate and high quality evidence, respectively).

<li><b>Model 2:</b> This study involved 130 studies with 8341 participants, where 4588 received ketamine and 3753 were controls. Various surgeries were included. Ketamine doses varied, and the risk of bias was generally low or uncertain. The main analysis was not stratified by surgery type or other factors. Ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption and pain at rest and during movement at 24 and 48 hours. Results were consistent across different factors. No analysis by dose was possible, and there was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. The quality of evidence was downgraded if small-study effects were present. Ketamine</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> We found 130 studies with 8341 participants. We were interested in studies that looked at the use of ketamine for ear, nose, and throat surgery. We looked at all types of surgery, and at different durations, up to 12 weeks. We found that ketamine reduced the amount of pain at 24 hours, and the need for analgesic analgesics, when used as the first analgesic after surgery. Over 48 hours, people given ketamine needed 13 more analgesics (10 to 15 mg per kg/minute) than those given placebo (19% from 67 mg per hour). Pain at rest (at 24 hours) and at 48 hours (at 48 hours) was 19% lower and 22% lower, respectively, in the ketamine group and 21% in the control group, compared with the placebo group, respectively. Pain during movement (e.g. knee arthroscopy) was 14% lower with ketamine than with placebo (29% from 1806 participants), and 16% less with R-ketamine (23% from 1353 participants). The quality of evidence was high for pain at rest and 48 hours; low for pain during movement and 24 hours (18% from 1906 patients) and 24% from 2449 patients). We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if the size of the study was small and the number of participants was not large. We did not have enough information to know which ketamine dose was best.</li>

We found nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one quasi-RCT (ITIS) that met the criteria of the review. Six of the RCTs were conducted in the UK, one in the USA and one each in Australia, New Zealand and the USA. In general, at least 50% of calls were handled by telephone advice alone. The results of the studies showed that when healthcare professionals (e.g. doctors) use the phone, it can reduce the number of patients who need to visit their GP's, the need for surgery and the frequency of out-of-hours visits to the hospital. However, the quality of the evidence for each of these results is low. Further research is required to determine the best use of the service.</li>

    <p>We identified nine studies that enrolled 682 participants. None of the studies reported blinding or group allocation methods. Seven studies were judged to be at low risk of incomplete outcome reporting; three studies were judged to be a low risk of selective reporting (protocols were available and/or all outcomes relevant to the this review were reported); and two studies were judged free of other potential biases. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale with no treatment and two made comparisons with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Compared with no treatment, Rheum officinale had a positive effect on SCr (MD -87.49 µmol/L, 95% CI -139.25 to -35.72) and BUN (MD -10.61 mmol/L, 95% CI -19.45 to -2.21). Compared with captopril, a statistically significant difference was not demonstrated in relation to Rheum officinale for any outcome (BUN, CrCl, or patients' capacity to undertake work). No data were available on all-cause mortality or cost of treatment. Only minor adverse events were reported in association with Rheum officinale. Currently available evidence concerning the efficacy of Rheum officinale to improve SCr and BUN levels in patients with CKD is both scant and low quality. Although Rheum officinale does not appear to be associated with serious adverse events among patients with CKD, there is no current evidence to support any recommendation for its use.</p>

No data were available on all-cause mortality or cost of treatment. Only minor adverse events were reported in association with Rhearm officinare. Currently available evidence concerning the efficacy of Rheaum officinara to improve SCr or BUN levels in patients with CKD is both scant and low quality. There is no current evidence to support any recommendation for its use. Seven of the nine studies were judged to be at low risk of incomplete outcome reporting; three studies were rated to be selective reporting (protocols were available and/or all outcomes relevant to the this review were reported); and two were judged free of bias.</li>
<li><b>Model 1:</b> We found nine studies with 682 participants, but none mentioned blinding or group allocation methods. Seven studies had a low risk of incomplete outcome reporting, three had a low risk of selective reporting, and two were free of other biases. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale to no treatment, and two compared it to captopril, an ACE inhibitor. Rheum officinale showed positive effects on SCr and BUN levels compared to no treatment, but no significant difference compared to captopril. There was no data on all-cause mortality or treatment cost. Only minor side effects were reported with Rheum officinale.</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We identified nine studies that enrolled a total of 682 participants. Seven studies compared the use of Rheum officinale with no treatment, and two made a comparison with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Rheamolac officinare had a positive effect on SCr and BUN levels in patients with CKD. However, no significant difference was demonstrated in relation to BUN, CrCl, or patients' capacity to undertake work. No data were available on all-cause mortality or cost of treatment. Only minor adverse events were reported in association with Rheaum officinune. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The review authors conclude that Rheomolac Officinale does not appear to be associated with serious adverse events among patients with chronic kidney disease.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> We found nine studies that enrolled 682 people with CKD. We found that Rheum officinale does not seem to be a drug of first-line use that is associated with a high risk of serious adverse events. Only minor adverse events were found in the short-term in the group of patients who were included in the review. No data were available on death from any cause, all-cause death, or cost of treatment. We assessed seven of the studies as at low risk of bias; three of them were judged to be of high quality (protocols were available and/or all outcomes relevant to the this review were reported); and the other two studies were judged as free of bias.</li>

    <p>Twenty-three trials involving 724 people were included. There is evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids (improvement rate difference 44%, 95 CI 28 to 59%), oral PUVA (improvement rate difference 44%, 95 CI 26 to 62%). However, a combination of PUVA and retinoids is better than the individual treatments. The use of topical steroid under hydrocolloid occlusion is beneficial. It would also appear that low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful in treating PPP. Colchicine has a lot of side effects and it is unclear if it is effective and neither was topical PUVA (rate difference of 0.00, 95% CI -0.04 to +0.04). There is no evidence to suggest that short-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) is effective. Many different interventions were reported to produce "improvement" in PPP. There is, however, no standardised method for assessing response to treatment, and reductions in pustule counts or other empirical semi-quantitative scoring systems may be of little relevance to the patient. This review has shown that the ideal treatment for PPP remains elusive and that the standards of study design and reporting need to be improved to inform patients and those treating them of the relative merits of the many treatments available to them.</p>

    <p>Three trials that examined cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and involving 268 adults were included. Meta-analysis of these studies found a beneficial effect of using a desensitization protocol over a rechallenge protocol at six months of follow-up for preventing discontinuation of cotrimoxazole (number needed to treat (NNT) 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-33.0), and for lower incidence of overall hypersensitivity (NNT 4.55, 95% CI 3.03-9.09). No severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred for either protocol in the three studies. In the small trials included in this review, when compared to cotrimoxazole rechallenge for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, cotrimoxazole desensitization resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations and overall adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients with a previous history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole. Paediatric data and trials in resource-poor settings are urgently required.

Patients were randomised to early post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415) or delayed post-operative bathing (dressing to be retained for at least 48 hours before removal and resumption of normal bathing) (n = 442). The only outcome of interest reported in this trial was surgical site infection (SSI). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed SSIs between the two groups (857 patients; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.48). The proportions of patients who developed SSIs were 8.5% in the early bathing group and 8.8% in the delayed bathing group. There is currently no conclusive evidence available from randomised trials regarding the benefits or harms of early versus delayed post-operative showering or bathing for the prevention of wound complications, as the confidence intervals around the point estimate are wide, and, therefore, a clinically significant increase or decrease in SSI by early post-operative bathing cannot be ruled out.

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> This review includes one trial with 857 patients who had minor skin surgery. They were divided into two groups: early bathing (415 patients) and delayed bathing (442 patients). The main focus was on surgical site infections (SSIs). No significant difference in SSIs was found between the groups (8.5% early, 8.8% delayed). Current evidence from this trial is not enough to determine the benefits or risks of early versus delayed bathing after surgery. More trials are needed to make a clear conclusion.</li>

We found only one trial, which was at a high- risk of bias. This trial included 857 patients who had skin excision surgery. The trial was at high-risk of bias, as the trial was not well conducted. The only outcome of the trial that we found was wound infection. There was no difference in the number of people who had wound infections between the two groups. The proportion of people with wound infections was 8.5%, which was the same as in the delayed group. There is no conclusive evidence from the one trial that was found that early or late post-operation shower or bath is better than delayed post-op bathing for the prevention of wound infections. There were no data on the number or type of wound infection, and, as a result, we are not sure if there is a difference in risk of wound wound infection by early or delayed post surgical bath. We suggest that there is more research to compare the early or the delayed postoperative shower or bathing.</li>

<li><b>Model 1:</b> This review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions to inform people at CJD or vCJD risk of receiving a CJD-specific health care, or to support them afterwards. No studies were found that met the inclusion criteria for this Cochrane review. In the thematic synthes, 49 studies and pieces of the wider literature, which were from the same population, intervention, and outcome review, but not the Cochrane, were included. The thematic synthesis suggests that ideally, the thematronic communication of people at risk of CJD/vCJD should be a multi-faceted, multidirectional, and multidonal programme, which aims to ensure that the communication is targeted and responds to the specific needs of people, and that activities to help people to use their voice, such as widespread education, and to support their access, are in place. It also suggests, in the thematics, that poor behaviour may have harmful effects, such in the case of people who are not able to use health care.

<li><b>Model 2:</b> This text discusses a Cochrane review that found no studies meeting its criteria. However, 49 studies from broader literature were used for a thematic synthesis. The synthesis suggests that effective communication should be a long-term, multi-component program, tailored to individual needs and supported by education and healthcare access monitoring. Poor communication can lead to negative effects like discrimination. There isn't enough strong evidence to determine the best approach for notifying and supporting people at risk of CJD or vCJD. The synthesis can still help inform policy and practice decisions in the absence of rigorous studies.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> The aim of this Cochrane review was to assess the best way to communicate with people at risk for any reason. We searched for all randomised or quasi-randomised trials that had looked at this topic, and found 49. This is an overview of a Cochrane study, which we included in the meta-analysis. Results of the Cochrane systematic review were summarised in appendices of each of the appendices. There were no trials that looked at the use of interventions to alert those at risk of developing CJD or vCJD that they are at risk, or to find out how best to support them. Also, there were no studies that investigated the best method to inform policy and practice on this topic. The results of the thematic synthesis can be used to guide policy and clinical practice. They can help us to make decisions about whether or not to inform or help to help to support someone at risk. If we are not able to reach out to them, we need to use them as a tool to do so. This is particularly true for those at high risk for a range of reasons, such as if they are not aware of their risk and/or do not know the date, gender, or if they have a history of drug use. In other words, if we do not find any good-quality trials, we will not be able to draw any conclusions about the best strategy.</li>

    <p>In total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data; 430 participants converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and 130 participants to other forms of dementia. Follow-up ranged from less than one year to over four years for some participants, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years. Conversion to Alzheimer’s disease dementia The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases).The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. At the median specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 75% (95% CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.47). Six studies (164 cases and 328 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100% while the specificities were between 22% and 86%. At the median specificity of 47.5%, the estimated sensitivity was 81% (95% CI: 64 to 91), the positive likelihood ratio was 1.55 (CI 1.31 to 1.84), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.39 (CI: 0.19 to 0.82). Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio. The sensitivities were between 80% and 96% while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies were few and small. Only one study reported the accuracy of CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. A significant number of studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard, participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. The accuracy of these CSF biomarkers for ‘other dementias’ had not been investigated in the included primary studies. Investigation of heterogeneity The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding). We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be included. The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment, as opposed to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid. However, these tests may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Future studies with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified.</p>

<li><b>Model 1:</b> A total of 1282 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were identified in 15 studies, with 1172 having analyzable data. 430 participants converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 130 to other forms of dementia. Follow-up times varied, but most were between one to three years. The accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers t-tau, p-tau, and p-tau/ABeta ratio were evaluated in different studies, with varying sensitivity and specificity values. The studies had poor reporting and unclear risk of bias, with eight out of 15 being of poor method</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> This is an update of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's previous Cochrane review on the use of CSF test of t-tau for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia. We searched for all relevant research up to 30 November 2015. We included 15 randomised and quasi-randomised studies with a total of 1282 adults with MCI. All of them had mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. We found that CSF tests appear to be more reliable than other biomarker tests for the detection of Alzheimer's or other form of dementia, and that they are better than some of the other tests that have been used for the treatment of the condition. However, we are not sure if they are as accurate as other biomarkers that are used to diagnose Alzheimer's diseases. We do not know which of these tests is the most accurate. We did not find any studies that looked at the accuracy of other CSF biomarkers (p- tau/ABeta) for the diagnostic of ‘other dementias’. We were not able to formally assess these biomarkers as they were not included in the studies we have included in our review. We believe that the quality of the research to date is low to very low. This is due to a lack of data and a high risk of bias in many of the studies.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> We included 15 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 1282 participants with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. Follow-up ranged from less than one year to over four years for some participants, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies were few and small. The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases). At the median sensitivity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 75% (95% CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72, and the negative likelihood ratio were 0.32. The sensitivity values ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged between 48% to 88%. The sensitivity and specificity values were between 22% and 86%. At the average specificity of 47.5%, the sensitivity was 81% and the specificity was 81%, and at the median specificity of 81%, the positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.55 and 0.39, respectively. Six studies (164 cases and 328 non- cases) evaluated the accuracy of CSF p-t Tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100% and between 80% and 96%, and the specificities were between 33% and 95%. Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-case participants) assessed the accuracy and specificity of the cTau/ABeta ratio. Only one study reported the accuracy. We could not combine the results of these two tests because of the small number of studies and the small sample size of the included studies. We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small numbers of studies available to be included in this review. The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling, index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding). The quality of the studies was poor. A significant number of these studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard, participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment, as opposed to ruling it in. However, these tests may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. The inclusion of these CSF biomarkers for ‘other dementias’ had not been investigated in the included primary studies. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid. The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of these tests.</li>

    <p>We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in this revision of the review. Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one three-arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standard-dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and high-dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes but there was no difference between standard and high-dose levels (low-quality evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low- to low quality evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard-dose rhGH versus no treatment (very low-quality evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes in the trials of short duration (low-quality evidence). There is low- to very low-quality evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effects, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low-quality evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low-quality evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs. When compared with no treatment, rhGH therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass. Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials. The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes, emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect with therapy in a population predisposed to CF-related diabetes. No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or side-effects were observed in this review due to the small number of participants. Long-term, well-designed randomised controlled trials of rhGH in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH in CF.</p>

Postoperative mortality (OR 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.54; P = 0.32), overall survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; P = 0.29), and morbidity showed no significant differences, except of delayed gastric emptying, which significantly favoured CW (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.05 to 8.70; P = 0.04). Furthermore, we noted that operating time (MD -45.22 minutes, 95% CI -74.67 to -15.78; P = 0.003), intraoperative blood loss (MD -0.32 L, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.03; P = 0.03), and red blood cell transfusion (MD -0.47 units, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.07; P = 0.02) were significantly reduced in the PPW group. All significant results were associated with low-quality evidence based on GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We included eight RCTs with a total of 512 participants. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. This was due to the lack of information and variation in the methods used in the studies, which made it hard to be sure that the outcomes were the same as they were in the control group. We found that overall survival and the rate of gastric emptying (the time taken for the gastric tube to open) were similar in the treatment groups. Operating time, bleeding, and red blood cell transfusion were significantly lower in the PPW group. However, some perioperative outcome measures (such as the time to open the gastric tube and the need for a transfusion) favoured the CCW procedure. The evidence is up-to-date as of 7 April 2015.</li>

    <p>Five trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included a total of 1503 women, with a mean of 301 participants. The trials compared the following contraceptives: combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system 20 µg/day (LNG-IUS 20); LNG-IUS 12 µg/day (LNG-IUS 12) versus LNG-IUS 16 µg/day (LNG-IUS 16); and LNG-IUS 20 versus the copper T380A intrauterine device (IUD). In the trials comparing two different types of methods, the study arms did not differ significantly for contraceptive efficacy or continuation. The sample sizes were small for two of those studies. The only significant outcome was that a COC group had a higher proportion of women who discontinued for 'other personal reasons' compared with the group assigned to the LNG-IUS 20 (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85), which may have little clinic relevance. The trial comparing LNG-IUS 12 versus LNG-IUS 16 showed similar efficacy over one and three years. In three trials that examined different LNG-IUS, continuation was at least 75% at 6 to 36 months. We considered the overall quality of evidence to be moderate to low. Limitations were due to trial design or limited reporting. Different doses in the LNG-IUS did not appear to influence efficacy over three years. In another study, continuation of the LNG-IUS appeared at least as high as that for the COC.

In another study, the number of women that continued to use the contraceptive method for at least three years after the end of the trial was similar to that for the Coc. In the trial comparing LNG, the trial showed similar efficacy over one and three years, but there were too few women in the trial to be able to draw any firm conclusions.

The studies included a total of 1503 women, with a mean of 301 women. The trials compared the following birth-controlling methods: combined oral contraceptive (COC) versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system 20 µg/day (LNG-IUS 20); LNG-iUS 12 µg or 16 µg versus LNG. The LNGs were compared to the copper T380A intrauterinesure device (IUD). The trials comparing two different types of methods did not differ significantly for contraceptive efficacy or continuation.

The trial comparing LNG 12 versus L NG-Ius 16 showed similar efficacy over one and three years. In three trials that examined different LNG, the L NGs showed similar effectiveness over six to 36 months. Different doses in the Lng-IUs did not appear to influence efficacy over three years, and in another study, continuation of the LGG-IS appeared at least as high as that for the COC.

The trials compared the use of LNG to birth control methods other than LNG. We found that LNG was as good as other LNGs (pessary) for birth control in one trial, but LNG had a higher drop-out rate (30%) than the COC group (20%). LNG appeared to work at least as well as the other pills used in the pills. LNG may cause more side effects (e.g. hair loss, skin rash) than other pills.

Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trial continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids. Opioids were administered orally (number of study treatments groups [abbreviated as "k"] = 12, n = 3040), transdermally (k = 5, n = 1628), or intrathecally (k = 10, n = 231). Many participants discontinued due to adverse effects (oral: 22.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.3% to 32.8%]; transdermal: 12.1% [95% CI: 4.9% to 27.0%]; intrathecal: 8.9% [95% CI: 4.0% to 26.1%]); or insufficient pain relief (oral: 10.3% [95% CI: 7.6% to 13.9%]; intrathecal: 7.6% [95% CI: 3.7% to 14.8%]; transdermal: 5.8% [95% CI: 4.2% to 7.9%]). Signs of opioid addiction were reported in 0.27% of participants in the studies that reported that outcome. All three modes of administration were associated with clinically significant reductions in pain, but the amount of pain relief varied among studies. Findings regarding quality of life and functional status were inconclusive due to an insufficient quantity of evidence for oral administration studies and inconclusive statistical findings for transdermal and intrathecal administration studies. Many patients discontinue long-term opioid therapy (especially oral opioids) due to adverse events or insufficient pain relief; however, weak evidence suggests that patients who are able to continue opioids long-term experience clinically significant pain relief. Whether quality of life or functioning improves is inconclusive. Many minor adverse events (like nausea and headache) occurred, but serious adverse events, including iatrogenic opioid addiction, were rare.</p>

<li><b>Model 2:</b> We found 26 studies with a total of 4893 participants. Most studies (22 out of 27) looked at the use of oral (oral) or transdermally (intracathecal) opioids, and one looked at transdermal (intraathecally) analgesics (transdermal analgesics). All three modes of administration reduced the amount of pain that participants felt. However, many patients stopped taking the drugs due to side-effects (like nausea and headache) or because they were too painful. Many of these patients were not able to take the drugs long-term due to adverse events (like rash). However, patients who are able to be able to stay on the painkillers for the rest of their life will have much less pain than if they are not allowed to take them. Whether they will have more pain than they need to be on painkillers and whether they will improve their quality of life or function is not clear. We did not find any studies that looked at opioid use for more than three months. We do not know if people who use opioids for pain relief in the short-term are more or less likely to be dependent on them for their pain relief.</li>
<li><b>Model 3:</b> We included 26 studies with 27 treatment groups that enrolled a total of 4893 participants. Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trial continuations, the other was an RCT comparing two opioids. Opioids were administered orally, transdermally, or intrathecally. All three modes of administration were associated with clinically significant reductions in pain, but the amount of pain relief varied among studies. Many participants discontinued due to adverse effects or insufficient pain relief. Many minor adverse events (like nausea and headache) occurred, but serious adverse events, including iatrogenic opioid addiction, were rare. Signs of opioid addiction were reported in 0.27% of participants in the studies that reported that outcome. Findings regarding quality of life and functional status were inconclusive due to an insufficient quantity of evidence for oral administration studies and inconclusive statistical findings for transdermal and intrathecal administration studies. However, weak evidence suggests that patients who are able to continue opioid therapy for a long period of time experience clinically significant pain relief; however, the quality of the evidence is inconclusive.</li>

    <p>We found four RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT). All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid and without topical corticosteroid and had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year. These trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa. All trials reported data on visual acuity ranging from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any important difference between the corticosteroid group and the control group. The pilot study of the SCUT reported that time to re-epithelialization in the steroid group was 53% slower than the placebo group after adjusting for baseline epithelial defect size (hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.94). However, the SCUT did not find any important difference in time to re-epithelialization (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11). For adverse events, none of the three small trials found any important difference between the two treatment groups. The investigators of the largest trial reported that more patients in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90). One trial reported quality of life and concluded that there was no difference between the two groups (data not available). We did not find any reports regarding economic outcomes. Although the four trials were generally of good methodological design, all trials had considerable losses to follow-up (10% or more) in the final analyses. Further, three of the four trials were underpowered to detect treatment effect differences between groups and inconsistency in outcome measurements precluded meta-analyses for most outcomes relevant to this review. There is inadequate evidence as to the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive topical corticosteroids compared with no topical corticosteroids in improving visual acuity, infiltrate/scar size, or adverse events among participants with bacterial keratitis. Current evidence does not support a strong effect of corticosteroid, but may be due to insufficient power to detect a treatment effect.</p>

One of the trials was a trial of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers (SCUT) trial. The other three trials were of short duration (no more than one year), and one of them was a pilot study of the Steroid-For-Cervical-Ulcers Trial (Steroid-for-Corneal Ucers Trial). All of the studies compared the use of corticosteroids with or with no topical corticostomy and had a follow-up of from 30 to 500 participants. These studies were published from 1991 to 2014 and were all of high quality. We did not find any trials that compared corticoprofen-based ointment with placebo. All trials reported data on visual acuity, which ranged from three weeks to one year, and none of them found any difference between the corticosticoid group and the control group. The SUT trial found that re-epithelialization was 53% faster in the steroid group than in the placebo group. However, the SUT group did not have as many adverse events as the treatment group. In addition, the largest of the three trials found that more patients in the group treated with corticotherapeutic keratitis developed an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). One trial reported quality of life, which was not reported. None of the other three studies found that there was any difference in the rates of adverse events between the treatment groups. Although the four trials were generally of good design, all of the patients lost 10% to 10% of their eyes in the final analyses. The evidence is up-to-date as of July 2014.</li>
<li><b>Model 1:</b> We found four randomised controlled studies (RCTs) that compared the treatment of keratitis with corticostimulants (topical corticoids) or no treatment.

The other three trials were small and had follow-up periods of two months or less. The evidence is current to July 2014. The review found no evidence that topical corticosteroids are effective in improving the visual acuity, scar size, or adverse events among participants with bacterial keratiti. The investigators of the largest trial reported that more patients in the control group developed eye pressure (intraocular pressure) elevation. One trial reported quality of life and concluded that there was no difference between the two groups (data not available). We did not find any reports regarding economic outcomes.

    <p>We included six trials with a total of 137 participants. We found two studies with 45 participants examining the effects of tDCS compared to control (sham tDCS) on our primary outcome measure, impairment, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). There was very low quality evidence for no effect of tDCS on change in global UPDRS score ( mean difference (MD) -7.10 %, 95% confidence interval (CI -19.18 to 4.97; P = 0.25, I² = 21%, random-effects model). However, there was evidence of an effect on UPDRS part III motor subsection score at the end of the intervention phase (MD -14.43%, 95% CI -24.68 to -4.18; P = 0.006, I² = 2%, random-effects model; very low quality evidence). One study with 25 participants measured the reduction in off and on time with dyskinesia, but there was no evidence of an effect (MD 0.10 hours, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.34; P = 0.41, I² = 0%, random-effects model; and MD 0.00 hours, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.12; P = 1, I² = 0%, random- effects model, respectively; very low quality evidence). Two trials with a total of 41 participants measured gait speed using measures of timed gait at the end of the intervention phase, revealing no evidence of an effect ( standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.50, 95% CI -0.17 to 1.18; P = 0.14, I² = 11%, random-effects model; very low quality evidence). Another secondary outcome was health-related quality of life and we found one study with 25 participants reporting on the physical health and mental health aspects of health-related quality of life (MD 1.00 SF-12 score, 95% CI -5.20 to 7.20; I² = 0%, inverse variance method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence; and MD 1.60 SF-12 score, 95% CI -5.08 to 8.28; I² = 0%, inverse variance method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence, respectively). We found no study examining the effects of tDCS for improving activities of daily living. In two of six studies, dropouts , adverse events, or deaths occurring during the intervention phase were reported. There was insufficient evidence that dropouts , adverse effects, or deaths were higher with intervention (risk difference (RD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.12; P = 0.40, I² = 0%, random-effects model; very low quality evidence). We found one trial with a total of 16 participants examining the effects of tDCS plus movement therapy compared to control (sham tDCS) plus movement therapy on our secondary outcome, gait speed at the end of the intervention phase, revealing no evidence of an effect (MD 0.05 m/s, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.25; inverse variance method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence). We found no evidence of an effect regarding differences in dropouts and adverse effects between intervention and control groups (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.21; Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects model; very low quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of tDCS for reducing off time ( when the symptoms are not controlled by the medication) and on time with dyskinesia ( time that symptoms are controlled but the person still experiences involuntary muscle movements ) , and for improving health- related quality of life, disability, and impairment in patients with IPD. Evidence of very low quality indicates no difference in dropouts and adverse events between tDCS and control groups.</p>

<li><b>Model 1:</b> We found six studies with a total of 137 participants. We found that tDCS does not seem to be a useful treatment for Parkinson's disease. We did not find any studies that compared tDCS with sham tDCS. We also found no study that looked at the effects of tDCS on activities of daily living. In one study, tDCS was associated with more dropouts, side effects, or deaths. In the other study, there was no evidence of an effect. There was not enough evidence to know if tDCS is a good way to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's in the short or long term. We do not know whether tDCS reduces impairment or short-term symptoms (i.e. shortness of walking, poor balance, poor co-ordination, or poor gait) in the long-term. We are not able to draw any conclusions about the use of tDCs in people with Parkinson's. We need more research to find out if they are a good treatment option. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence to be very low. This means that we are very uncertain about the results.</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We analyzed six trials with 137 participants to study the effects of tDCS on Parkinson's disease. The results showed very low-quality evidence for no significant effect on overall UPDRS scores, but some effect on motor subsection scores. There was no evidence of an effect on dyskinesia, gait speed, or health-related quality of life. No studies examined tDCS for improving daily activities. Two studies reported dropouts, adverse events, or deaths, but there was no significant difference between tDCS and control groups.

Two studies with 45 participants examined the effects of tDCS compared to control (sham tDCS) on our main outcome, the Unified Parkour and Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UPDRS). We found no evidence of an effect of tCS on the UPDRS score. However, there was evidence of a reduction in the UDPRS part III motor subsection score at the end of the intervention phase. One study with 25 participants measured the reduction in off and on time with dyskinesiasia, but there was no evidence that tDCS reduced the time that symptoms were controlled but the person still experienced involuntary muscle movements. Two trials with a combined total of 41 participants examined gait speed using timed gait at the conclusion of the treatment phase. We found one trial with a group of 16 participants examining the effects on the effects (tDCS plus movement therapy) of tDCS plus movement therapies on our secondary outcome, gait. We did not find any evidence of any effect of the tDCS on the change in global UPDR score. We also found no difference in dropouts and adverse effects between the tDCs and control groups. We could not determine the effects for reducing off time ( when the symptoms are not controlled by the medication) and on the time with symptoms (time that symptoms are controlled but people still experience involuntary muscle movement) and for improving health- related quality of life, disability, and impairment in patients with IPD. We identified no study examining the effect of using tDCS for improving activities of daily living. In two of six studies, dropouts, adverse events, or deaths occurred during the intervention.

The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08), quality of life (CHQ-PhS: n = 115; WMD -3.96, 95% CI -8.91 to 1.00) and aerobic capacity (n = 124; WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.19). The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant. None of the studies reported negative effects of the exercise therapy. Overall, based on 'silver-level' evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy can improve functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity or pain. The low number of available RCTs limits the generalisability. The included and excluded studies were all consistent about the adverse effects of exercise therapy; no short-term detrimental effects of exercise therapy were found in any study. Both included and excluded studies showed that exercise does not exacerbate arthritis. The large heterogeneity in outcome measures, as seen in this review, emphasises the need for a standardised assessment or a core set of functional and physical outcome measurements suited for health research to generate evidence about the possible benefits of exercise therapy for patients with JIA. Although the short-term effects look promising, the long-term effect of exercise therapy remains unclear.</p>

    <p>We included one small study (involving 24 women). The study was a single-centre randomised trial conducted in Mexico. This study compared a control group who received antihypertensive therapy, anticonvulsant therapy, plasma expanders, corticosteroids and dypyridamole with an intervention group that received epidural block instead of the antihypertensives, as well as all the other four drugs. Lumbar epidural block was given using 0.25% bupivacaine, 10 mg bolus and 5 mg each hour on continuous epidural infusion for six hours. This study was at low risk of bias in three domains but was assessed to be high risk of bias in two domains due to lack of allocation concealment and blinding of women and staff, and unclear for random sequence generation and outcome assessor blinding. The included study did not report on any of this review's important outcomes. Meta-analysis was not possible. For the mother, these were: maternal death (death during pregnancy or up to 42 days after the end of the pregnancy, or death more than 42 days after the end of the pregnancy); development of eclampsia or recurrence of seizures; stroke; any serious morbidity: defined as at least one of stroke, kidney failure, liver failure, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary oedema. For the baby, these were: death: stillbirths (death in utero at or after 20 weeks' gestation), perinatal deaths (stillbirths plus deaths in the first week of life), death before discharge from the hospital, neonatal deaths (death within the first 28 days after birth), deaths after the first 28 days; preterm birth (defined as the birth before 37 completed weeks' gestation); and side effects of the intervention. Reported outcomes The included study only reported on a single secondary outcome of interest to this review: the Apgar score of the baby at birth and after five minutes and there was no clear difference between the intervention and control groups. The included study also reported a reduction in maternal diastolic arterial pressure. However, the change in maternal mean arterial pressure and systolic arterial pressure, which were the other reported outcomes of this trial, were not significantly different between the two groups. Currently, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness, safety or cost of using epidural therapy for treating severe pre-eclampsia in non-labouring women. High-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the use of epidural agents as therapy for treatment of severe pre-eclampsia. The rationale for the use of epidural is well-founded. However there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show that the effect of epidural translates into improved maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, there is a need for larger, well-designed studies to come to an evidence-based conclusion as to whether the lowering of vasomotor tone by epidural therapy results in better maternal and fetal outcomes and for how long that could be maintained. Another important question that needs to be answered is how long should extended epidural be used to ensure any potential clinical benefits and what could be the associated side effects and costs. Interactions with other modalities of treatment and women's satisfaction could represent other avenues of research.</p>

    <p>We included one small randomised controlled trial (involving 24 women). The study was conducted in Mexico. This study compared a control group who received antihypertensive therapy, anticonvulsant therapy, plasma expanders, corticosteroids and dypyridamole with an intervention group that received epidural block instead of the other four drugs. Lumbar epidural blocks were given using 0.25% bupivacaine, 10 mg bolus and 5 mg each hour on continuous epidural infusion for six hours. The included study did not report on any of this review's important outcomes. For the mother, these were: maternal death (death during pregnancy or up to 42 days after the end of the pregnancy); development of eclampsia or recurrence of seizures; stroke; any serious complications (defined as at least one of stroke, kidney failure, liver failure, HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary oedema). For the baby, these outcomes were: death: stillbirths (death in utero at or after 20 weeks' gestation), perinatal deaths plus deaths in the first week of life, death before discharge from the hospital, neonatal deaths (death within 28 days after birth), deaths after the first 28 days, and preterm birth (birth before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy).

    <h4>Original</h4>
    <p>We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants. All were randomised trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data. Seventeen of the studies had student populations. Most of the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection bias. Findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes (n = 1196) were mixed, with effects showing a reduction, increase or consistent with no evidence of effect. The median standardised mean difference (SMD) for the three trials (n = 394) with continuous outcomes was -0.25, with SMDs ranging from -0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.39 to -0.31) to -0.17 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.20). Odds ratios (OR) for the two studies (n = 802) with dichotomous discrimination outcomes showed no evidence of effect: results were 1.30 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.19) and 1.19 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.65). The 19 trials (n = 3176) with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention, at the three following time periods: -0.38 (immediate), -0.38 (1 week to 2 months) and -0.49 (6 to 9 months). SMDs for prejudice outcomes across all studies ranged from -2.94 (95% CI -3.52 to -2.37) to 2.40 (95% CI 0.62 to 4.18). The median SMDs indicate that mass media interventions may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice, and are equivalent to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with schizophrenia to that associated with major depression. The studies were very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, interventions and outcomes, and only two meta-analyses within two subgroups were warranted. Data on secondary outcomes were sparse. Cost data were provided on request for three studies (n = 416), were highly variable, and did not address cost-effectiveness. Two studies (n = 455) contained statements about adverse effects and neither reported finding any. Mass media interventions may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes. Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents. The findings are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review. Such research should use robust methods, report data more consistently with reporting guidelines and be less reliant on student populations.</p>

<li><b>Model 1:</b> We found 22 randomised or quasi-RCTs (studies in which one or more of two or more treatments are compared) involving 4490 participants. Most of the studies had a high risk of bias (i.e. bias due to the way they were designed and performed). Most of them had a low risk of systematic bias (that is, overestimation of the true effect because of the way the studies were run and reported). The findings from the five randomised trials with the most common type of bias were mixed, with effects shown a small to medium reduction in the level of bias. We found that the three trials with continuous outcomes (involving 394 participants) showed that the intervention may have a moderate to medium decrease in the amount of bias, which is about the same as the other treatments (1 week to 2 months) and about the other treatment (6 to 9 months). However, we found that it is not clear if it makes a big impact on the rate of bias because the results of the other trials were mixed. We are not able to draw any conclusions about the effect of mass media interventions on bias because we did not find any studies that looked at this. We do not know about the cost of mass interventions. The quality of the evidence was low for the main outcomes for bias and bias, low for side effects and very low for costs. More research is needed to find out which type of mass intervention works best, to better understand which types of mass treatment work best, and to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness. Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health providers as the target group, and none targeted at young adults.</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants. All were randomised controlled trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of these studies had data that could be analysed. The studies were very different in their populations, media types, and ways of making the interventions. Most of them had a small to medium-size effect in reducing the level of bias. We found that mass media programmes may have a small but medium-to-small effect in the reduction of bias, and that they may be equivalent to the level that is commonly seen in people with mental health problems. We could not find any studies that looked at the effects of mass media on the cost-effectiveness of the programmes. We did not find studies that examined the cost of the mass media programs. We are not sure if mass media campaigns are cost-free. We do not know if they are harmful. We need more research to find out if mass Media programs are harmful, and to find the best way to make them work.</li>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> This updated review included seven prevention studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1,361 people). The studies' quality was generally low, with only five meeting 50% or more of the internal validity criteria. There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training for preventing low-back pain. However, it is unclear if they are more effective than other interventions for treating low-back pain. High-quality randomized trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of lumbar supports, focusing on compliance, various outcome measures, patient types, and lumbar support types.</li>
<li><b>Model 1:</b> The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of lumbar support interventions for low-back pain. Lumbar supports are a group of medications that aim to help people to rest and rest for at least four to five days. They are used to help the muscles of the leg to relax and to help them to do the same in high-risk patients. There are a range of types and doses of these medications, as well as the way they can be used. This review found that lumbar interventions are not more effective than no or other treatments for the treatment of low- back pain. There is a need for more studies to be done to find out the true effects of these medicines. In the meantime, people with low back pain should not be bothered to take the medicine they are given. Further research is needed to find the best lumbary support methods. The review found moderate to low quality studies that have looked at the effects of treatment with the use of the use of this medicine in preventive measures (e.g. short-term, long-term), prevention (up to three months) and treat measures (up to five-year) on the efficacy of this medicine. Also, more research is required to see if the use of this medication is effective in provider of pre-treatment to promote the treatment of low-back pain.</li>
<li><b>Model 2:</b> We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared the effectiveness of lumbar supports with no intervention or training for the treatment of low-back pain. We included seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low. Only five of the fifteen studies met 50% or more of the internal validity items. There was moderate evidence of moderate effectiveness in preventing low back pain, and conflicting evidence of conflicting effectiveness in other preventive interventions. It is still unclear whether lumbars are more effective than no or other interventions for treating low-lower back pain. There is still a need for high quality randomised trials on the effectiveness.

Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome measure for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured. There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women). Similarly, only one trial reported on rates of dyspareunia (a secondary outcome measure for this review) at two months and six months with no statistically significant difference between both groups; two months, (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, one study, 26 women) and six months, (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.87, one study 32 women). This trial also included data on the numbers of women who resumed sexual intercourse by two months and six months. Significantly more women in the secondary suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, one study, 35 women), although by six months there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.28). Neither of the trials included data in relation to the following prespecified secondary outcome measures: pain at any time interval; the woman's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the perineal wound; exclusive breastfeeding; maternal anxiety or depression. Based on this review, there is currently insufficient evidence available to either support or refute secondary suturing for the management of broken down perineal wounds following childbirth.

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> The purpose of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of the use of secondary suturing in women with a perineal wound following birth. We found only one randomised controlled trial (involving 52 women) that compared the effects of sutured and non-sutured wounds. There was a trend to favour the resutured group in terms of the rate of healing at less than four weeks, although no reference was made to show how healing was measured. There was no difference in rates of dyspareunia (period pain) at two months and six months, although more women in the group that did not have suture had recovered by two months. This was the case in the control group, but not in the'resutured' group. The quality of the study was poor, and the numbers of women in each group were too low to draw any conclusions. In conclusion, there is not enough good-quality research to show which is the best way to treat these wounds.</li>

As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we did a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files, and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery. Surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 2.01), had no significant effect in participants with 30% to 49% stenosis (N = 1429, RR 0.93, 95%CI 0.62 to 1.38), was of benefit in participants with 50% to 69% stenosis (N = 1549, RR 0.84, 95%CI 0.60 to 1.18), and was highly beneficial in participants with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (N = 1095, RR 0.47, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.88). However, there was no evidence of benefit (N = 271, RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.57 to 1.84) in participants with near-occlusions. Ipsilateral ischaemic stroke describes insufficient blood flow to the cerebral hemisphere, secondary to same side severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Endarterectomy was of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis (moderate-quality evidence), and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion (moderate-quality evidence). We found no benefit in people with carotid near-occlusion (high-quality evidence).</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We included three trials involving 6343 participants. The trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition (iipsoide) of stroke. We combined the results of the three trials, which were of high- and low-certainty, to provide a pooled result. We found that the risk of stroke was higher in people with less than 30% stenosis, but there was no difference in the risk in people who had more than that. The risk of a stroke was the same in both groups. The evidence was of high quality. We did not find any evidence that either of the treatments had an effect on the risk for people with stenosis of 50% to 69%. We found no evidence that the treatment had an impact on the chance of a near-occlusion (the area of the carotids where the carots are stuck close to the skin). We found evidence that people with 50% or 69%, and those with 70%, to 99%, of stenosis were more likely to be treated with endarterectomically assisted removal. We rated the quality of the evidence as high for the risk and safety of stroke, and as low for the risks and benefits of the treatment of stenotic carotidiitis.</li>

<li><b>Model 3:</b> We found three randomised trials (involving 6343 participants) that compared carotid artery surgery for people with ischaemic stroke. All three of the studies were performed in the 1980s and 1990s. We did not pool the data from all three studies, as they used different measures of ischaemia and definitions of stroke. However, we did pool data from 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), who were followed up from one year to five years. We found that surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis, but did not increase the risk in those with 30% to 49% stenitis. Endarterectomy was of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenitis, and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% steniasis, but not in those without near-occlusion (low- or very low-risk). We found no improvement in the risk of having a further stroke. There was no effect on any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery. We also found no benefit in the prevention of a new stroke in the short-term (i.e. up to one year). We rated the quality of the evidence from the three studies as low to high.</li>

    <p>Six trials fulfilled entry criteria. The majority of patients in these trials were preterm. Five small trials evaluated short-term cysteine supplementation of cysteine-free PN. One large multicenter RCT evaluated short-term N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants (≤ 1000 grams). Growth was not significantly affected by cysteine supplementation (1 trial) or by N-acetylcysteine supplementation (1 trial). Nitrogen retention was significantly increased by cysteine supplementation (4 trials) (WMD 31.8 mg/kg/day, 95% confidence interval +8.2, +55.4, n = 95, including 73 preterm infants). Plasma levels of cysteine were significantly increased by cysteine supplementation but not by N-acetylcysteine supplementation. N-acetylcysteine supplementation did not significantly affect the risks of death by 36 postmenstrual weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), death or BPD, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), severe ROP, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), or severe IVH. Available evidence from RCTs shows that routine short-term cysteine chloride supplementation of cysteine-free PN in preterm infants improves nitrogen balance. However, there is insufficient evidence to assess the risks of cysteine supplementation, especially regarding metabolic acidosis, which has been reported during the first two weeks of cysteine chloride administration.

    <p>Three RCTs (333 participants) were identified, two of which were multicentre trials comprising only participants positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The other trial enrolled participants clinically diagnosed with bronchiolitis from a hospital in Italy. All studies used 2.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of nebulised rhDNase compared with placebo either as a daily or a twice daily dose. Adjunctive therapy included nebulised salbutamol, steroids, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids or tube feeding, nasal washing, nasal decongestants and antibiotics. Overall, nebulised rhDNase showed no benefit in clinically meaningful outcomes. Meta-analysis favoured the control group with a shorter duration of hospital stay (MD 0.50; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.90, P = 0.01) and better clinical score improvement (SMD -0.24; 95% CI -0.50 to 0.01, P = 0.06). The largest trial showed no difference in supplemental oxygen use or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In one RCT, four out of 11 patients in the treatment group had atelectasis. Two of these patients showed distinctive clinical improvement after nebulised rhDNase. There was no significant difference in adverse events. These included temporary desaturation, temporary coughing, increased coughing, facial rash, hoarseness, dyspnoea and bad taste, reported in a total of 11 patients from both treatment groups. The results based on the three included studies in this review did not support the use of nebulised rhDNase in children under 24 months of age hospitalised with acute bronchiolitis. In these patients, treatment did not shorten the length of hospitalisation or improve clinical outcomes. It might have a role in severe bronchiolitis complicated by atelectasis, but further clinical studies would need to be performed.</p>

    <p>We included 21 studies with 2658 randomised participants. All studies assessed the effectiveness of some form of psychological therapy. We found no studies that included physical therapy. Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); the remainder evaluated behaviour therapies, third-wave CBT (mindfulness), psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy. Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list. Five studies compared the intervention to enhanced or structured care. Only one study compared cognitive behavioural therapy with behaviour therapy. Across the 21 studies, the mean number of sessions ranged from one to 13, over a period of one day to nine months. Duration of follow-up varied between two weeks and 24 months. Participants were recruited from various healthcare settings and the open population. Duration of symptoms, reported by nine studies, was at least several years, suggesting most participants had chronic symptoms at baseline. Due to the nature of the intervention, lack of blinding of participants, therapists, and outcome assessors resulted in a high risk of bias on these items for most studies. Eleven studies (52% of studies) reported a loss to follow-up of more than 20%. For other items, most studies were at low risk of bias. Adverse events were seldom reported. For all studies comparing some form of psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list that could be included in the meta-analysis, the psychological therapy resulted in less severe symptoms at end of treatment (SMD -0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.16; 10 studies, 1081 analysed participants). This effect was considered small to medium; heterogeneity was moderate and overall quality of the evidence was low. Compared with usual care, psychological therapies resulted in a 7% higher proportion of drop-outs during treatment (RR acceptability 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 14 studies, 1644 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Removing one outlier study reduced the difference to 5%. Results for the subgroup of studies comparing CBT with usual care were similar to those in the whole group. Five studies (624 analysed participants) assessed symptom severity comparing some psychological therapy with enhanced care, and found no clear evidence of a difference at end of treatment (pooled SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; considerable heterogeneity; low-quality evidence). Five studies (679 participants) showed that psychological therapies were somewhat less acceptable in terms of drop-outs than enhanced care (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; moderate-quality evidence). When all psychological therapies included this review were combined they were superior to usual care or waiting list in terms of reduction of symptom severity, but effect sizes were small. As a single treatment, only CBT has been adequately studied to allow tentative conclusions for practice to be drawn. Compared with usual care or waiting list conditions, CBT reduced somatic symptoms, with a small effect and substantial differences in effects between CBT studies. The effects were durable within and after one year of follow-up. Compared with enhanced or structured care, psychological therapies generally were not more effective for most of the outcomes. Compared with enhanced care, CBT was not more effective. The overall quality of evidence contributing to this review was rated low to moderate. The intervention groups reported no major harms. However, as most studies did not describe adverse events as an explicit outcome measure, this result has to be interpreted with caution. An important issue was that all studies in this review included participants who were willing to receive psychological treatment. In daily practice, there is also a substantial proportion of participants not willing to accept psychological treatments for somatoform disorders or MUPS. It is unclear how large this group is and how this influences the relevance of CBT in clinical practice. The number of studies investigating various treatment modalities (other than CBT) needs to be increased; this is especially relevant for studies concerning physical therapies. Future studies should include participants from a variety of age groups; they should also make efforts to blind outcome assessors and to conduct follow-up assessments until at least one year after the end of treatment.</p>

    <li><b>Model 0:</b> We found 21 randomised studies with 2658 participants. All studies assessed the effect of some form of psychological therapy. We did not find any studies that looked at the use of a drug or physical therapy. Fourteen of the 21 studies compared the forms of CBT (CBT) with usual care or a waiting list, and five of them compared the CBT to enhanced or structured care. We found no studies that compared CBT with other forms of therapy such as psychodynamic (mindfulness) therapy. Most of the people included in the studies had long-term somatoform (Somatoform symptoms) or MUPS (joint pain) symptoms. The CBT treatments ranged from one to 13 times a week for one day to nine months. Most studies reported follow-up of two weeks to 24 months. The duration of symptoms, reported by nine studies, was at least one year, and most of the studies were of short duration (70% or more). We found that CBT was better than usual care (up to one day) in terms of symptoms at the end of treatment (10 studies, 1081 participants). However, this effect was small to medium. We also found that when we looked at people with Soma and MUPS who received CBT compared with those who were treated with enhanced care, we found that Soma was similar to those in the whole group. We were not able to combine the data from all of the included studies due to inconsistencies in the methods used in some of the analyses. However, we were able to do this in part due to the quality of the trials. We are satisfied that people in the control groups were not aware of whether they were on CBT or on the other side (i.e. the 'usual care' group). We are not sure if this would have had an impact on our results. We do not know if people who were in the treatment groups were aware of which group they were in. We have not been able to draw any firm conclusions about whether CBT is better than other types of therapy for Soma, MUPS, or both. This is because most studies did not report on this topic. The quality of evidence contributing to this review was rated as low to moderate. This means that we are uncertain about the accuracy of the results.</li>
