This review of the evidence shows that the right upper lobe of the right lung is still filled with mass, and the left upper lung is also filled. There is no evidence of a change in lung function. The right upper lung has been affected by the spread of the lymphangium.

This review of the evidence is up-to-date as of September 2014. The review includes data from two published studies. One showed that the thyroid gland was normal in size. The other showed that it was not affected. The thyroid gland did not appear to be affected in the same way in both men and women. The two studies did not find any evidence that thyroid disease was present in the lungs or in the airways. However, thyroid gland scarring was reported separately from the other parts of the body.
In this review, the size of the nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung is unchanged. The left upper lobe in image 17 is also unchanged. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are clear. Normal thyroid. Normal course and caliber of the aorta. Mild heart and vessels: Normal cardiac size. No pericardial effusion. Normal pulmonary artery is normal size. Mild coronary arteries and aortas are unchanged. Stable nodular deposits of the adrenal glands. No aggressive bone lesions. Routine changes in the thoracic spine.
In this review, we looked at changes in the size of the heart and vessels. The heart appears normal in size. The lungs are stable. No new or enlarging lung lesions. No aggressive bone lesions.

The middle lobe of the middle lobe has persistent attenuation of the segmental bronchi of the lung and a subsegmental atelectasis. Again seen mild lung herniation through the right third space in the upper lung. Mucous and secretions in the proximal trachea. Normal course and caliber of the aorta. Stable trace pericardial effusion.

No pericardial effusion. - Hepatic hypodensity, likely to represent a cyst. - Side effects of exercise. - Hemangioma in T7 vertebra body.

The right hilar node is not discerned on this noncontrast examination. No enlarged lymph nodes. Mild bilateral gynecomastia. The left upper lobe of the right lung appears to change post radiation change, probably related to airways disease. No pericardial and aortic valve calcifications. Upper Abdomen: No aggressive bone lesions. Thyroid is unremarkable.
In this review, the size of the right upper lobe of the heart and the right pulmonary artery is stable. The right pleural effusion has slightly increased with time. The airways are patent. No aggressive bone lesions were noted. The included portion of thyroid gland is unremarkable. The central pulmonary artery appears upper normal, may be suggestive of pulmonary arterial pressure. Mild coronary calcifications ( calcification of the arteries) were again noted. No serious disease was noted.
This review of the literature found no new cancer cells in the lung. No new nodules were found. No significant change in size of the nodules. No pleural effusion or lung wall swelling. No aggressive bone lesions. Heart and vessels: Heart is normal in size. Normal course and caliber of the pulmonary artery calcifications. Left chest wall therapy port tip terminates in the distal SVC.
In this review, the thyroid gland is unremarkable. No new thyroid nodes are noted. The lungs are normal in size. The airways are patent. Normal course and caliber of the heart and vessels appear normal. No aggressive bone lesions. Remote healed bilateral rib fractures. Mild gynecomastia is again noted.
In the prior study in the right lower lobe, a 1 cm nodule described as new on the prior studies has resolved. No new or enlarging of the nodule has been found. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax have been observed. Normal lung size. Central airways are clear. Normal thyroid. Heart and vessels: Normal cardiac size. Normal course and caliber of the thoracic artery is normal size. Upper abdominal organs and soft tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. The right hilar node measuring up to 1.2 cm short axis in series 4 image 231 is unchanged.
In this review, the size of the right upper lobectomy and the number of nodes (nodules) in the right lung were measured. No new or enlarging nodules were found. The left lower lobe of the lung had a stable 6 mm right lower lobe nodule (3:248). No new and enlarging lesions were seen. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was observed. No aggressive bone lesions were observed. The thyroid is unremarkable. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. Main pulmonary artery measures 34 mm. Normal course and caliber of the pulmonary artery. No obstruction of the airways. Hepatic steatosis. No pericardial effusion. Upper Abdomen: Left adrenal disease is a rare disease.
In this review, the size of the upper and lower lobe of the chest and the lower lobe (bronchus) of the aorta (lungs) are compared. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No aggressive bone lesions. There is no evidence of an obstruction of the airways. The airways are patent with no pulmonary nodules greater than 5 mm identified. The cardiac chambers appear to be grossly normal in size. The liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands are similar to the rest of the body. The visualized bowel is not obstructed. There were no signs of obstruction in the lower bronchi. There was no evidence for a difference in the size and shape of the vessels. No signs of inflammation at the GE junction. The vasculature of the left upper lobe and lingula appears to be normal, and there are no aggressive lesions or acute bony abnormalities.
In this review, the thyroid gland and lymph nodes, heart and vessels, and the lungs/airways/pleura/aorta are examined. The thyroid gland has a large mass and lymph node and the lymph nodes have a small mass. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules are seen. The central airways are patent. No aggressive bone lesions are noted. The heart is enlarged. No pericardial effusion. Vascular calcification noted throughout the heart. Upper Abdomen: Please see separately dictated report for the findings in the abdomen. The patient is status post CABG, median sternotomies and mitral annuloplasty.
In this review, the size of the heart and vessels and of the lungs/airways/pleura were compared with those in the control group. The review of trials found that the right lung and airways/bronchial tree thickened, and the right upper lobe (5:116) and left lower lobe (261) were stable. The right breast (4:20) had calcified, but no lymph nodes were affected. In the left breast (3:260) calcification of the artery in the aortic and coronary artery was observed. No lymph nodes had lymph nodes affected. The left upper lobe was stable. No pleural effusions. There is no evidence of adenopathy of the left lung. No pericardial effusion. The heart chambers appear normal in size. Normal course and caliber of the arteries. Older healed rib fractures were reported separately. Stable compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies were observed.
In this review, the heart and vessels were examined. The heart is normal in size. No abnormal growths were found. The lungs are normal and the aortic valve is normal. No evidence of obstruction of the airways. The abdomen was examined separately for findings in the abdomen. No aggressive bone lesions were found and there were no changes of the spine. Moderate triple vessel coronary artery calcifications were observed and calcification of the valve. No pericardial (under the skin) or pleural (through the lungs) effusion was found.
