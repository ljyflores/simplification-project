 Three trials involving a total of 206 participants were included. All three included trials were assessed as being at high risk of bias. The results of these trials were not consistent with the results of the other two trials. The results of the two trials that failed to show an improvement in functional performance were not consistent with the results of the other two trials. The results of the two trials that failed to show an improvement in functional performance were not consistent with the results of the other two trials.
 The evidence is current to May 2014. We found seven studies including 960 participants. The quality of the studies was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment. There was a high level of statistical variation between the studies, which therefore reduces the reliability of the evidence. There was no significant difference in infection rates between drains and no drains groups. There was no significant difference in infection rates between drains and no
 The evidence is current to May 2014. We included eight studies with 390,769 participants. Five studies used a prospective cohort design, two were case-control studies and one a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The results form the studies assessing associations between flavonoid intake, colorectal cancer and adenomas. There was no evidence that total flavonoid intake reduced the risk of colorectal cancer or adenomas
 We included seven trials with 1369 participants. All trials had high risk of bias. Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three other trials used the second definition of slow responders. None of the included trials mentioned our primary outcomes. However, regarding the secondary outcomes, extension of the treatment period increased the sustained virological response according to both definitions (71/217 (32.7%) versus 52/194 (26.8%). The risk ratio for the other secondary outcomes
 The evidence is current to May 2014. We found two studies (34 participants) that evaluated the accuracy of EUS in assessing the resection of pancreatic cancer. Both studies evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of EUS in assessing the resection with curative intent in pancreatic cancer. The mean probability of unresectable disease after CT scan across studies was 60.5% (that is 61 out of 100 patients who had resectable disease after CT scan

 We searched for studies that compared CDUS with other methods of detecting blood clots. We found 42 studies with 4220 participants. Twenty studies provided accuracy data based on the number of individual participants (seven of which provided data with and without the use of contrast). Sixteen of these studies evaluated the accuracy of CDUS. These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of these
 We included seven studies, with 766 participants. Four studies used intracutaneous injections, two subcutaneous injections, and one both. All studies reported on low back pain in the lumbar or sacral regions. However, failure to demonstrate a normal distribution for pain, and use of different scales meant meta-analysis was inappropriate. No study reported primary dichotomous efficacy outcomes. One reported the number self-scoring 4/10 cm or more reduction in
 We searched for studies up to January 2015 and found 12 studies with 1932 participants. The overall postoperative pain in the glue group was reduced by 37% in the glue group compared with the suture group. However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh. Subgroup analysis of included studies using lightweight mesh showed the reduction of chronic pain was less profound and insignificant. Subgroup analysis of included studies using heavyweight mesh showed a significant benefit
 We found 32 studies addressing technical editing and 66 surveys of reference accuracy. Only three of the studies were randomised controlled trials. A 'package' of largely unspecified editorial processes applied between acceptance and publication was associated with improved readability in two studies and improved reporting quality in another two studies, while another study showed mixed results after stricter editorial policies were introduced. More intensive editorial processes were associated with fewer errors in abstracts and references, and more intensive reporting was
 We included 15 studies including 721 participants with cancer pain. All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children. The included studies were of adequate methodological quality, but all except one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because of small study size, and six because of methods used to deal with missing data or high withdrawal rates. Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period
 We included 12 studies of 563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbS<unk>thal aged six to 35 years. The majority of participants were African-American.
