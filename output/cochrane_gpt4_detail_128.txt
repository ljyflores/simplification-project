We looked at 38 studies with 7843 kids. After teaching kids and their parents about asthma, they had fewer emergency room visits and hospital stays. They also had fewer unplanned doctor visits. We don't know much about other results, like how they felt or how well their lungs worked. Teaching kids and parents about asthma can help them avoid emergencies and hospital visits. We still need to learn more about the best way to teach them and how it affects their lives.
We looked at 130 studies with 8341 people. They had different surgeries like ear, nose, throat, teeth, chest, back, hip, knee, breast, stomach, and more. Some people got a medicine called ketamine, and others did not. Ketamine helped people feel less pain and need less pain medicine after surgery. It also helped them feel less sick to their stomach. Most people did not have bad side effects from ketamine. The results were similar for different surgeries and when ketamine was given at different times.
Scientists tested a vaccine called MSP/RESA on 217 people in five different trials. All trials checked if the vaccine was safe, and two trials checked if it worked well. No one had bad side effects from the vaccine. In one trial, 17 people who didn't have immunity to malaria didn't show any change in how fast the malaria parasites grew. In another trial with 120 kids in Papua New Guinea, the vaccine didn't stop them from getting sick with malaria, but it did help lower the number of parasites in their blood. This only worked for kids who didn't take a malaria medicine before getting the vaccine. The
Four studies with 125 people were looked at. They tested how well special electric fields helped heal broken long bones. Most of the information was about a bone called the tibia. All the studies were done in a careful way, but they had some problems. The main thing they looked at was if the electric fields helped the bones heal at a certain time. The results were not very strong and didn't show a big difference. There was a lot of difference between the studies. They also checked if the results changed after 24 weeks, but they still didn't show a big difference. Two studies found that the electric fields didn't help
In a study, 1831 people were split into two groups: one with a drain (915 people) and one without a drain (916 people) during a surgery called laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This surgery was done for different reasons in 12 different tests. The people in the tests were between 48 and 63 years old, and more than half of them were women. The study found that there was no big difference in how well people did after the surgery, whether they had a drain or not. The time it took for the surgery was a little longer for the group with a drain. There was also no
We looked at 49 tests with 3639 people that were done in China. They tested 38 different herbal medicines to see if they helped with numbness, pain, and nerve problems. The results from these tests are not very strong because the tests were not done very well. Some tests talked about bad side effects, but many did not. We cannot say if these herbal medicines are safe or not because there is not enough information. Most of the tests were not done very well, so we should be careful when looking at the results. Right now, we do not have proof that Chinese herbal medicines can help with diabetic nerve problems.
This text talks about a review of five studies with 1,382 patients who have advanced prostate cancer. The studies were small and didn't last very long. They didn't look at how long people lived or if the cancer spread. Only one study looked at certain test results. They found no big differences between two treatments for different levels of cancer. For some patients, one treatment worked better. The studies mostly talked about side effects. One study found no difference in side effects between the two treatments, except for one, which was lower in one group. The information from these studies is limited because they were small and short. There is no
We looked at 12 studies with 7,119 people about putting in IUDs (a type of birth control) right after an abortion or waiting a bit. We found that putting in the IUD right away might make it come out more easily, but after six months, more people still had their IUDs if they got them right away. The studies showed that it is safe and practical to put in an IUD right after an abortion.
We looked at one small study about how meditation helps people who are very sick with a blood disease called leukemia. The study had 91 people at first, but only 42 stayed until the end. We don't know their ages or if they were boys or girls. The study wasn't very clear, so we think it might not be very good. We found that meditation might help these sick people feel better and less sad. But we don't know if it helps with other things like being tired, worried, or sleeping well. We need more good studies to know if meditation really helps people with blood diseases. Right now, we don
We looked at three tests with 110 healthy kids who had brothers or sisters that were sick. The tests were different in many ways, so we couldn't combine the results. Two of the tests might not be very good. In total, 13 out of 56 kids who got the vaccine (23%) got sick, while 42 out of 54 kids who didn't get the vaccine (78%) got sick. Most kids who got the vaccine and still got sick had a mild sickness with less than 50 spots on their skin. In the tests, most kids got the vaccine within three days after being near the sickness. We
We looked at 12 studies with 4704 people in this review. These studies compared different ways to prevent infections using antibiotics before surgery. One study compared using antibiotics to not using them at all. All the studies had some problems that could affect the results. Most of the people in the studies did not have a certain type of infection called MRSA before their surgery. We could not combine the results of the studies because they were too different. In four studies, 14 out of 1401 people (1.0%) died, but there was no big difference between the groups that got different treatments. No one had serious problems from
We looked at two studies (116 women) that compared home and hospital care for women with a certain pregnancy problem. There were not enough women in the studies to get clear results. The studies only included women who met specific requirements. Women were watched for 2 to 3 days before being put into a group. One study looked at baby deaths, but there wasn't enough information to see if there was a difference between home and hospital care. There were no differences in other baby health issues, when the baby was born, how much the baby weighed, or if the baby needed special care. There was no information on serious problems for the
There are two main ways to close the skin after a special kind of surgery called a caesarean. One way uses staples that stay in the skin, and the other way uses stitches that dissolve. Both ways have about the same chance of getting an infection. They also have similar problems with the cut healing. But, the type of cut can make a difference in how well these methods work. Staples can sometimes cause the skin to separate, which means the cut needs to be closed again. But, this doesn't happen all the time, and it depends on how the staples are used. There isn't a clear answer yet
We looked at 11 studies with 821 people. Seven studies were about green tea, and four were about black tea. The teas were given in different amounts and forms. One more study is looking at green tea powder capsules. No studies talked about heart problems. Black tea helped lower bad cholesterol and blood pressure, but only a few studies showed this, and they might be biased. Green tea also helped lower cholesterol and blood pressure, but the results were not stable. When we looked at both teas together, they helped lower bad cholesterol and blood pressure. Some bad things happened in five studies, like getting sick or having health problems, but
Two small tests with 23 people were looked at in this review. Some of these people might have had lung problems. There was no information about how much medicine they took. The tests did not show big differences in breathing measurements or how the people felt. One test found a difference in a certain measurement, but it is not clear if this is important. The tests had some problems, like not enough people and not the best methods, so we cannot use the results to make decisions about medicine. In 2010, no new tests were found. Right now, there is not enough proof to say that azathioprine helps treat long
We looked at 56 studies with 4068 people in them. Most of the people had breast cancer. We found that exercise helped 1461 people feel less tired compared to 1187 people who didn't exercise. Exercise worked better for people with breast and prostate cancer, but not for those with blood cancer. Aerobic exercise, like running, helped reduce tiredness, but other exercises didn't show a big difference. We learned that aerobic exercise is good for people with cancer-related tiredness during and after treatment, especially for those with solid tumors. We still need to find out the best kind of exercise, how hard to do
We looked at 1796 records and found five important studies. These studies were done with adults between 16 and 65 years old. We combined the results of these studies to better understand the treatments for a type of cancer called Hodgkin Lymphoma. The studies showed that a treatment called BEACOPP might help people live longer and have less cancer coming back compared to another treatment called ABVD. However, BEACOPP might cause more side effects like low blood counts and infections. We are not sure if BEACOPP causes more long-term side effects like other cancers or problems with having children. We need more information
We looked at 15 studies with 1835 cancer patients. Most of these studies were about breast cancer or prostate cancer patients. The studies were about different ways to help patients feel better and return to work. Some studies taught patients how to take care of themselves, while others had patients do physical exercises. We found that these methods did not make a big difference in helping patients return to work or feel better. We also looked at 7 studies that compared different medical treatments. We found that less intense treatments had similar results as more intense treatments in helping patients return to work and feel better. Lastly, we looked at 5 studies that combined
We looked at four studies with over 13,000 women from the UK and Ireland who were having babies. These studies checked if a special test called admission CTG helped women during labor. The studies showed that this test did not help much and might even cause more women to have a c-section (a surgery to get the baby out). The test also did not show any big differences in the health of the babies. So, it is better not to use this test for women who are low risk when they go into labor. The information in this review might be helpful for other countries too.
We looked at 32 studies about growing embryos. These studies had different ways of growing embryos, so we couldn't combine their results. Only a few studies talked about live births or pregnancies that were still going on. Most of these studies didn't find any differences between the ways they grew embryos. One study said that using Quinn's Advantage helped more pregnancies happen, but we're not sure if this is true. Some studies talked about problems like having more than one baby at once or losing a pregnancy, but they didn't find any differences between the ways they grew embryos. None of the studies talked about how healthy the babies were. Most of
We looked at 2847 articles and found 30 that seemed important. After removing duplicates and articles with the same information, we had 23 left. But none of them answered our question about the best way to tell women they have breast cancer. We think it might be hard to study this because it's not nice to test different ways on women who are already scared. We need to find a better way to study this topic. Maybe we can look at how doctors talk to patients during their first visit when they discuss treatment options. This might help us learn the best way to communicate without causing more problems.
We looked at 17 studies with 1006 people in them. One new study added 113 more people. After a special activity, people had less chest pain for the first three months. They also had more days without chest pain. But after three months, the chest pain did not change much. The studies had some problems, like the people doing the activities knowing which group the person was in. Also, some studies had other issues that made the results less clear. This big review shows that some activities, like talking about feelings and thoughts, can help with chest pain for a short time. Another option is hypnotherapy. But
We looked at 30 tests with 4344 people and 17 different medicines. These medicines help with allergies and were tested in at least one experiment. The most common test was comparing azelastine to a fake medicine (nine studies). The tests had different results and quality, but most had a low chance of being wrong. The tests only looked at short-term effects, from one to eight weeks. We could only compare two medicines directly (olopatadine and ketotifen). There is some proof that these allergy medicines help with seasonal eye allergies when compared to a fake medicine. No serious problems were reported from using these
Three studies were looked at to see if they could help understand how to stop kids from smoking. Two of these studies focused on Native American kids (1505 kids in total). They tried different ways to help them not smoke, but after 42 months, there wasn't a big change in how many kids smoked. One study did find a difference in how many kids used smokeless tobacco, but the other study didn't see a change after six months. These studies might not be perfect, so we can't say for sure if these ways to stop kids from smoking work or not. We need more research to help us understand this better.
We looked at six reports and found one study with 72 women who have a blood problem called sickle cell anemia. The study was not very clear. It showed that giving blood to these women before they have problems did not make a big difference in their health or their babies' health. The study did not talk about some important things like how long the women stayed in the hospital or if their babies needed special care. We need more and better studies to know the best way to help women with sickle cell anemia when they are pregnant.
We looked at 67 studies with 6197 people in them. All the studies had some problems. We found that most things were the same in the different groups, but there were a few differences. One main difference was that using a special tool called a radiofrequency dissecting sealer caused more problems than another method called clamp-crush. There were also some differences in how much blood was given to people and how long they stayed in the hospital. We don't have enough information to say if using special tools for liver surgery is better or worse than other methods. The radiofrequency dissecting sealer might cause more problems, so it
We looked at 23 tests with 724 people. Some treatments help with a skin problem called PPP. These treatments are retinoids, oral PUVA, and a mix of PUVA and retinoids. Using a special cream with a bandage also helps. Some other treatments might help too, like low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics, and Grenz Ray Therapy. But, colchicine has many side effects and might not work. Topical PUVA and hydroxycarbamide might not work either. There are many ways to see if a treatment works, but we don't have a perfect
Nine tests looked at how well five different water pills (loop diuretics) helped lower blood pressure in 460 people. These tests lasted about 8.8 weeks. The water pills lowered blood pressure by about -8/-4 mmHg, but this might be too high of an estimate. The quality of the information was not very good because the tests had some problems and there might be other tests we don't know about. We didn't find any big differences between the different water pills. We couldn't tell how the amount of the water pills affected the results. The tests didn't give us a good idea of the possible
We looked at 58 studies about using a numbing medicine inside the belly during a specific surgery. Most of these studies had some problems, and they mostly included people who were at low risk during the surgery. The most common numbing medicine used was bupivacaine. The way the medicine was given was different in each study. No one died in the eight studies that talked about death. One person had a serious problem in the group that got the numbing medicine. Three studies said there were no problems during the surgery. Twenty studies said there were no serious bad effects from the numbing medicine. None of the studies talked about
We looked at 74 different studies about tests for a sickness called malaria. There are different types of tests that look for different things in the body. We compared these tests to see how well they worked. We found that some tests were better at finding the sickness, but not as good at telling if someone didn't have it. Other tests were better at telling if someone didn't have the sickness, but not as good at finding it. Overall, both types of tests can be used to help find out if someone has malaria. One thing to remember is that one type of test might still show a person has malaria even after they get better
We looked at five studies about how long doctor appointments should be. All of them were done in the UK. We are not very sure about the results because the studies had some problems. We don't know if making appointments longer or shorter helps with things like tests, medicine, or how happy patients are. The studies didn't talk about how much it costs to change appointment times. We need more good studies to know if changing appointment times is a good idea.
We looked at 3952 articles and found three important studies about a medicine called stavudine. These studies were done in developed countries with people who had already taken similar medicines. There were 157 people in these studies, and most of them were men. The studies had some problems, like differences in the people taking part and how the studies were done. So, we couldn't combine the results of the studies. But, we found that there was no big difference in how well the medicine worked at high or low doses. Some people had side effects like less bone density, less fat in their limbs, and higher fat levels in their
We looked at 10 tests with 1658 people in them. Five tests had a low chance of being wrong, and five had a medium chance. In six tests, they tried a special way of helping people breathe called "open lung ventilation." These tests checked if people lived or died. When we put the results together, we found that using open lung ventilation helped more people live in the hospital's special care unit. But it didn't change how many people lived after 28 days or when they left the hospital. It also didn't cause more breathing problems. It was hard to understand the results because the tests were different
We looked at 15 studies with 687 people to learn about how mental health treatments can help with asthma. The studies were not very good and had only a few people in them. But we still found some interesting things. Three studies looked at our main goal, but they didn't find big differences between the treatments and no treatment. In two studies, relaxation therapy helped people use less "as needed" medicine. But, relaxation therapy didn't make a big difference in how well people could breathe in four other studies. In two studies, a treatment called CBT made people feel better about their asthma. Another treatment, bio-feedback, helped
We looked at 35 studies with 6785 people to see if antidepressants or benzodiazepines work better for treating panic disorder. We found that both types of medicine seem to work about the same, but some people might have fewer side effects with benzodiazepines. We also found that some antidepressants might be easier to take than others. However, we need more information to be sure. Doctors should decide which medicine to give based on each person's needs. We need more studies to help us understand which medicine works best for treating panic disorder.
This text talks about a study with 29 tests and over 1,700 people who have a type of sickness called pancreatic carcinoma. They looked at different ways to help these people, like using plastic stents, metal stents, or surgery. They found that using plastic stents had fewer problems but a higher chance of the sickness coming back before the person passed away. Metal stents were better than plastic stents at keeping the sickness from coming back. There was no big difference in other problems or how many people passed away within 30 days. They also looked at different types of plastic stents and found that one kind worked better
We looked at five studies with 444 times when doctors put tubes into children's arteries. Four studies compared using ultrasound to feel the artery, and one compared ultrasound to listening with a special tool. Some studies had problems that could affect the results. It was hard to make sure the doctors didn't know which method they were using, which could change how well they did. Only two studies talked about problems that happened. Our results show that using ultrasound helps doctors succeed on their first try and have fewer problems, like blood clots. It seems like ultrasound might work better for babies and small kids than older kids, but we're not sure.
We looked at one small study from the Netherlands and three studies from Canada about how movies and commercials with alcohol affect how much people drink. The study from the Netherlands showed that young men who watched movies with less alcohol drank less than those who watched movies with more alcohol. The Canadian studies looked at different types of bans on alcohol advertising, but the results were not clear. Overall, we don't have strong evidence to say if banning alcohol advertising is good or bad. More research is needed to understand this better. None of the studies were paid for by alcohol or advertising companies.
Eight studies looked at 182 babies to see if different formulas affected their growth. They found no big differences in growth when using high or low MCT formulas. The studies also didn't show any clear effects on how well the babies tolerated the formulas or if they had any stomach problems. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of these formulas on growth and brain development.
We looked at a small study with 34 people that compared two different treatments for a pregnancy problem called chorioamnionitis. The study had some issues, so we can't be sure about the results. We couldn't find any other studies to help us understand if the treatments are good or not. In the study, some women got a special fluid treatment, while others did not. Both groups had similar results, like the number of babies born by C-section. We also looked at other things, like how long the women stayed in the hospital and how the babies were doing after birth. The study didn't give us enough information
Three studies with 1620 people were looked at. The Mini-Cog test had different results in each study. Some parts of the studies were not the same, so they could not be combined. All the studies had some problems that could affect the results. There are not many studies about the Mini-Cog test in community places. Because there are not many studies and they have problems, it is hard to say if the Mini-Cog test is good for checking thinking skills in community places. More good studies are needed to compare the Mini-Cog test with other short thinking tests in community places.
We looked at 19 studies about three types of medicines called amphetamines. These studies had 2521 people in them, mostly middle-aged white men with ADHD. Most of the studies were done in the USA, and they were short, lasting about 5 weeks. We found that these medicines might help with ADHD symptoms, but they didn't help people stay in treatment. Some people stopped taking the medicines because of side effects. Different types of amphetamines and doses didn't seem to make a big difference. We also looked at other medicines for ADHD, but we didn't find any proof that amphetamines were better. The
We looked at six new studies with 517 people, making a total of 10 studies with 811 people. These studies were different in many ways, like the type of pain, the amount of vitamin D given, and the results. Only two studies showed if people felt less pain; the others just showed average results. We didn't find a clear connection between vitamin D and feeling better (not very strong evidence). There weren't many bad side effects or people quitting the studies, and it was the same for vitamin D and the fake treatment (strong evidence). Now we have more than double the studies and people than before. Based on
We looked at 41 studies with over 200 practices and 48,000 patients. There were different types of studies and they were all different in many ways. Some studies were not very good in quality. All the studies tried different ways to help patients and doctors. Some focused on helping doctors, some on organizing care, and some on both. In 15 studies, they also taught patients about their health. When doctors got help, they did a better job with patients. But, it was not always clear if patients got better. When care was organized better, things went well too. When patients were taught about their health, they
Five tests were done to see which birth control methods work best for women. They looked at different types of birth control like pills, patches, rings, and devices put inside the body. They tested 1503 women in total. The tests showed that the different types of birth control worked about the same and most women kept using them. But, some women stopped using the pill for personal reasons. The tests also showed that different amounts of hormones in the devices didn't change how well they worked. The information from these tests is not perfect, but it helps us understand that different birth control methods work well for young women.
We looked at 88 tests about treating allergies (13 were new). There were tests for different allergies like dust mites, pollen, animals, mold, and latex. Some tests checked more than one allergy. Only 16 tests were done really well. The results were mixed, but overall, the treatment helped reduce asthma symptoms, use of medicine, and made breathing easier. The treatment worked better for some people than others. It was almost as good as using inhalers. But, there can be side effects like local reactions or more serious ones. We need to think about these risks when using this treatment.
We didn't find any new studies to add to our update. We still have six studies with 1,297 patients. Five studies had a low chance of mistakes, and one study had an unclear chance of mistakes. Using special breathing support helped patients live longer after 28 days and during their hospital stay. We don't know how it affects long-term survival, but it might help. Some differences in the studies make it hard to understand the results. Using smaller breaths is becoming a normal way to treat breathing problems, so more studies might not happen.
We looked at 15 studies with 1833 people. The studies were not very good quality. We found that it took longer for people to wake up from anesthesia with one medicine (isoflurane) than another (propofol). There was no difference in waking up time between another medicine (sevoflurane) and propofol. People had less nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane or isoflurane. There were more changes in blood pressure with propofol than with sevoflurane, but no differences in shivering or pain.
Four tests were done with 15,936 people who had high blood pressure. The average age was 75.4 years old. The tests looked at if treating high blood pressure could help prevent memory problems or dementia. The results showed no big difference between the people who got treatment and those who didn't. The tests also checked if the treatment helped with a memory test called MMSE, but it didn't show any benefits. The treatment did help lower blood pressure levels. Some people had to stop the treatment because of side effects, but there was no big difference between the two groups. The tests had some problems because some people in the
We looked at 12 studies with 3474 patients. Most of the information was not clear, but we think it did not affect the results. We found no proof that PTCRA helps patients with simple heart problems. For complex heart problems, PTCRA did not show a big difference in helping patients after 6 months or 1 year compared to another treatment called PTCA. We don't know if PTCRA works well for fixing problems inside heart stents. When comparing PTCRA with PTCA, there was no big difference in the risk of bad heart events during the hospital stay. However, PTCRA had
Three studies with 333 people were looked at. They tested a medicine called nebulised rhDNase for kids with a breathing problem called bronchiolitis. The medicine was given once or twice a day, along with other treatments. The results showed that the medicine did not help the kids get better faster or leave the hospital sooner. In fact, the kids who did not get the medicine did a little better. Some kids with a more serious problem called atelectasis seemed to improve, but more studies are needed. The medicine did not cause any big problems, but some kids had small side effects like coughing or a bad taste
Two studies with 181 people were looked at. They were testing two different ways to treat a health problem. One study was small and not very clear, while the other was bigger and better. They found that both ways of treating the problem were about the same. There was no big difference in how many people got better or had problems after the treatment. Both ways also had about the same number of people with bleeding issues. One difference they found was that one way of treating the problem was faster than the other. But, they think more studies should be done to learn more about these treatments. There is one more study happening now that might
Two tests were done to see if a sponge or a diaphragm worked better to stop pregnancies. The sponge did not work as well as the diaphragm in both tests. In the USA test, 17.4 out of 100 women using the sponge got pregnant, while 12.8 out of 100 women using the diaphragm got pregnant. In the UK test, 24.5 out of 100 women using the sponge got pregnant, and 10.9 out of 100 women using the diaphragm got pregnant. More women stopped using the sponge after 12 months than the diaphragm.
We looked at 16 studies to see if they could help us understand how to prevent or improve thinking problems in people with brain issues. We could only use six of these studies. Three of them tried to stop thinking problems from happening, and three tried to make them better. Some studies used medicine to try to stop thinking problems. One study used a medicine called memantine, and another used d-threo-methylphenidate HCL. The first study showed that memantine helped people think better overall, but it didn't help their memory specifically. The second study didn't find a big difference between the medicine and a fake pill.
Two studies with 26 people between 17 and 55 years old were looked at in this review. They tested if a special laser treatment helped people feel better after a certain type of injury. Some people got the real laser treatment, and others got a fake one. The studies found that the real laser treatment might help a little, but they were not sure. The studies did not look at other important things like pain, eating, speaking, or taste. They also did not look at how the treatment affected people's lives or if there were any bad side effects. The quality of the information from these studies was not very good because of
We looked at two studies with pregnant women to see if using two hormones, oestrogen and progestogen, can help prevent miscarriages. The first study had women with a history of diabetes, and the second study had women who had in-vitro fertilization (IVF). We found that using these hormones did not make a big difference in preventing miscarriages, early births, or baby health problems. However, using these hormones might increase the risk of cancer in the mother's reproductive system. We need more research to know if using these hormones can help prevent miscarriages.
This text talks about a study that looked at two types of medicines for depression, called TCAs and SSRIs. They compared these medicines to a fake medicine called a placebo. There were 14 studies with information that they used. Most of the studies were short, about 6-8 weeks long. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs worked better than the placebo. They also looked at how many people needed to take the medicine for it to work. For TCAs, it was between 7 and 16 people, and for SSRIs, it was between 7 and 8 people. They also checked how many
We looked at nine studies about a medicine called ibuprofen for treating headaches. These studies had 4373 people and 5223 headache attacks. The studies compared ibuprofen to a fake medicine (placebo) or other medicines. People took one dose of medicine for their headaches. Ibuprofen 400 mg helped more people feel better after 2 hours than the fake medicine. It also helped more people have no headache for 24 hours. Ibuprofen 200 mg also helped, but not as much as 400 mg. A special kind of ibuprofen 400 mg worked faster for 1-hour relief,
We looked at 43 studies (with 3497 people who have dry eyes) to see if over-the-counter (OTC) artificial tears work well. The studies were different in many ways, so it was hard to compare them. We found that it's not clear if all OTC artificial tears work the same or if some are better than others. But, we did find that one type of artificial tear (0.2% polyacrylic acid) worked better than another type (1.4% polyvinyl alcohol) in two studies with 175 people. Other artificial tears had mixed results or no differences between them.
A study with 136 patients looked at using a medicine called lamivudine for people with HIV. They found no difference in results for people who used lamivudine and those who didn't. Two other small studies also found no difference in how well the medicine worked. There were no studies comparing other medicines for people with HIV who didn't do well with their first treatment. Some studies show that using certain medicines can help, but more research is needed. Right now, doctors decide what to use based on what's available and what's best for the patient and the community.
We looked at 133 studies with 844,206 people. We checked seven different tests and found that some tests worked better than others. The upper lip bite test was the best for checking if it was hard to see inside someone's throat. The modified Mallampati test was the best for checking if it was hard to put a tube in someone's throat. We need more research to make these tests better and to find new tests.
We looked at 63 studies with 8014 people to see if probiotics help with diarrhea. Most of the studies were about babies and young kids. The studies were done in many different places and used different types of probiotics. No bad things happened because of the probiotics. They helped make diarrhea go away faster, but the results were different in each study. On average, diarrhea lasted about 25 hours less, and there was less poop on the second day. We don't know why the results were different in each study. It didn't matter what kind of probiotic was used or where the study was done. Probi
We looked at one small study that compared a special kind of care called "nidotherapy" with regular care. The study lasted 18 months and looked at how well people did in the short term (up to 6 months) and medium term (6 to 12 months). Nidotherapy seemed to help people with their social skills and use of other services, but the results were not strong enough to be sure. Some people left the study early, and there were no big differences between the two groups. There were also no big differences in bad things happening, like people passing away. The study had mixed results, so we need more
We looked at eight studies about a medicine called pregabalin for people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain all over the body. These studies showed that pregabalin can help reduce pain for some people. About 9% to 11% more people felt better with pregabalin than with a fake medicine (placebo). The medicine worked best at doses between 300 and 600 mg per day. However, some people had side effects from pregabalin, like dizziness, sleepiness, weight gain, and swelling. These side effects were more common with pregabalin than with the placebo. But serious
We looked at one study with 135 women who had a mild pregnancy problem. We are waiting for more information on six other studies. The study we looked at compared a medicine called magnesium sulphate to a fake medicine (placebo) and was a good study. The study did not tell us the main things we wanted to know. There was no big difference between the medicine and the fake medicine in how healthy the babies were at five minutes after birth or when they were born. However, more moms felt warm and flushed with the medicine than with the fake medicine. There was no big difference in bad side effects that made moms stop the treatment
Four studies were looked at for this review. Two used a mix of medicine and talking therapies, while the other two used talking therapies with one using text messages and the other using doctors trained to help people quit smoking. The results showed that these methods helped people quit smoking, but more research is needed to be sure. There is a big difference in health between Indigenous people and others when it comes to smoking-related sickness and death. This review shows that there isn't much information on how well these methods work for Indigenous people, even though they work for others. Because of this, it's hard to say for sure how well these methods work for
We looked at 13 studies with 5686 patients. About half of the studies had some problems, but we still used them because they didn't affect the results too much. We found that 75% of the studies were good and didn't have many problems. All 13 studies talked about how many people died in the hospital. We looked at two groups: people who had very risky surgeries and people who were in the intensive care unit (ICU) for other reasons. We found that using a special tool called a PAC did not change how many people died, how long they stayed in the ICU, or how much it cost
We looked at six different studies with 478 babies. These studies measured how much pain babies felt when they had blood tests. There were two ways to do the blood test: by poking a needle in the baby's vein (venepuncture) or by pricking the baby's heel (heel lance). We found that babies felt less pain when they had the needle poke (venepuncture) compared to the heel prick (heel lance). Giving babies a sweet taste before the blood test also helped reduce their pain. Babies cried less when they had the needle poke, especially if they had a sweet taste before the test. In conclusion, it
Two small studies looked at 52 women with a healing problem after giving birth. Only one study talked about how fast the wound healed in less than four weeks, but it didn't say how they measured it. The results were not very clear. Only one study talked about pain during intimate moments at two months and six months, but there was no big difference between the two groups. This study also looked at how many women started being intimate again by two months and six months. More women in one group started being intimate by two months, but by six months, there was no big difference between the two groups. The studies didn't talk about
We looked at 18 studies with 2521 people. Most of the studies were not very good. The studies compared different medicines made from plants to antiviral drugs. Only three studies showed that Chinese plant medicines might help prevent the flu and make flu symptoms better. One study found that 'Ganmao' capsules worked better than a drug called amantadine for making flu symptoms go away faster. There were no big differences between 'E Shu You' and another drug called ribavirin for treating the flu. Ten studies said there were some small side effects. Most of the plant medicines in the studies worked like
We looked at 8 studies with 580 people to find the best way to fix broken catheters. There were many different treatments tested, but no two studies looked at the same ones. Most of the studies had problems, like bad design, too many different people, not enough people, and being influenced by companies that make the treatments. One study showed that a certain treatment might work better than a fake treatment, but we can't be sure because there were problems with the study. Another study showed that using a special tool to fix the catheter might work just as well as using a medicine. However, the catheters didn't stay
We looked at 17 studies about different treatments for 2674 patients. These studies showed how well the treatments worked on tumors and how long patients lived. We compared adding a drug to the treatment plan with not adding a drug. We found no big difference in how long patients lived or how long it took for the cancer to get worse. But, adding a drug did help the tumors get smaller. However, it also caused more side effects like hair loss, feeling sick, and low white blood cell counts. So, adding a drug can help with tumor size, but it doesn't seem to help patients live longer or stop the cancer from
Ten different studies looked at 1,896 patients. They found no big difference in how many people passed away in the hospital or later on. But, better studies showed a small increase in people passing away in the hospital. People who went to a special care unit (NLU) had a better chance of going home and being able to do things on their own. They also had fewer early returns to the hospital. One study compared the NLU to another type of care (ICU) for very sick people. There was no big difference in how many people passed away or how long they stayed in the hospital. Early returns to the
We looked at 11 studies with 414 people to learn about using ultrasound for hand pain. Some studies were good, and some were not. We found that we don't know if one type of ultrasound is better than another. Only two studies talked about if people felt better after treatment. One study said that ultrasound might help, but we should be careful with the results. Another study said that ultrasound with a hand brace helped more than just a hand brace, but not as much as using a special light with a hand brace. We need more information to know if ultrasound is safe and works well for hand pain.
We looked at eight studies with about 10,000 people. They tested different medicines to see if they helped people who had a stroke before. The results showed that one type of medicine, called statins, might help a little bit in preventing more strokes or other heart problems. But, it didn't help in stopping people from dying suddenly. There isn't enough information to know if statins help people who had a certain kind of stroke, or when is the best time to start taking them. But, since statins can help people with heart problems, it's a good idea for people who had a stroke to take them.
This text talks about a review of eleven campaigns that tried to help people stop smoking. These campaigns were different in many ways, like how they were designed, where they took place, and how long they lasted. Some campaigns worked better than others, like the ones in California and Massachusetts. They helped a lot of people quit smoking compared to other places in the USA. Some other campaigns also had good results, but not all of them. Three big campaigns helped people smoke less, and four out of eight studies showed that people quit smoking or smoked less because of the campaigns. Some campaigns didn't work as well, but one of them still had
We looked at 24 studies with 2166 people. These studies showed that yoga can help people feel better, less tired, and sleep better when compared to doing nothing. Yoga also helped people feel less sad and worried when compared to talking or learning about their problems. But, yoga was not better than other exercises for making people feel better or less tired. Overall, yoga can be a good choice to help people feel better and sleep better.
We looked at a study about 125 people who had brain surgery for a type of cancer called glioblastoma. The study checked if taking pictures of the brain right after surgery was helpful or not. Most patients in the study had surgery, then got special treatments to help fight the cancer. The study showed that taking pictures right after surgery didn't really change how long people lived. We don't know much about the best way to take pictures of the brain after surgery. More research is needed to find out the best way to do this, especially since taking pictures can help doctors decide if more surgery is needed. Studying how fast the
We looked at three studies with 161 people who have schizophrenia. We could only use data for two of our seven main goals. We measured how much better people felt using a test called the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). There was no big difference between two medicines, chlorpromazine and metiapine (very low quality evidence). The number of people with parkinsonism at eight weeks was also similar (very low quality evidence). We couldn't use data for other important goals like mental state improvement, going back to the hospital, being happy with treatment, aggressive behavior, or cost of care. Chlorpromazine has been used to
We looked at 23 studies about different treatments for Crohn's disease. Probiotics did not work better than a fake treatment. Some antibiotics helped lower the chance of the disease coming back, but they also had more serious side effects. Mesalamine and Azathioprine/6MP medicines helped lower the chance of the disease coming back without causing more serious side effects. Mesalamine had a higher chance of the disease coming back in a small way but had fewer serious side effects than Azathioprine/6MP. We don't have enough information about some other treatments to know if they work. We need to think about
We looked at seven studies with 825 people. These studies tested different ways to help people who use drugs to drink less alcohol. We found that no method was clearly better than the others. The results were not very strong because there were not many studies and they were not of high quality.
We looked at 23 studies with 1,586 people in them. They tested a medicine called quinine to see if it helps with muscle cramps. They compared quinine to a fake medicine (placebo), vitamin E, and some other combinations. Most people took 300 mg of quinine per day. Quinine helped reduce the number of cramps, how strong they were, and how many days people had cramps. But it didn't change how long the cramps lasted. Some people had minor side effects like stomach problems, but there were no major side effects in these studies. However, taking too much quinine
We looked at seven studies with 406 people who had leg cramps. Some of these people had cramps because they were pregnant, and others had cramps for unknown reasons. The studies tested if magnesium helped with the cramps. For people with unknown reasons for cramps, taking magnesium did not make a big difference. It did not help with how often the cramps happened, how bad they felt, or how long they lasted. For pregnant people with leg cramps, the results were not clear. Some studies showed that magnesium helped, while others did not. More research is needed to know if magnesium helps pregnant people with leg cr
We looked at one study about a six-month exercise program for people with SMA, a muscle condition. The people in the study were between 10 and 48 years old. The study tried to see if the exercise program helped them walk better and be stronger. Some people did the exercise program, and some did not. The study found that the exercise program did not make a big difference in how well they could walk or how strong they were. The study also looked at how tired they were and how happy they were with their lives, but the exercise program did not make a big difference in these areas either. The study was not perfect,
Two studies with 149 people were looked at. Both studies had some problems and were not very clear. One study with 81 people who had neck pain found that surgery helped more than physical therapy or wearing a neck brace for a short time. After one year, there was no big difference between the groups. Another study with 68 people who had mild neck problems found no big difference between surgery and other treatments after three years. Many people did not finish the studies. These small studies had problems and do not give good information about neck surgery. We don't know if the short-term help from surgery is worth the long-term risks. More
We looked at nine studies about phone calls with doctors and nurses. Six studies compared phone calls to regular care. Three studies compared phone calls with different health workers. Some studies found fewer visits to doctors, but others found more return visits. At least half of the calls were just advice on the phone. Seven studies checked if there were more emergency room visits, but most found no difference. One study with nurse phone calls found more visits. Two studies looked at deaths and found no difference between phone calls with nurses and regular care. Phone calls with doctors and nurses might help reduce visits, but we still need to learn more about how it affects the
We looked at 84 tests (22,872 people) to see if talking to people about their drinking habits helps them drink less. We found that talking to them did help a little bit, but not a lot. People drank a little less often and had a little less alcohol in their blood. But, it didn't really help with big problems like binge drinking or drunk driving. The tests we looked at were not the best quality, so we can't be sure if talking to people about their drinking really helps or not.
This text talks about a study that looked at different ways to help people with asthma use their inhalers better. They looked at 29 different smaller studies with 2210 people who all had asthma. The studies tried different ways to teach people how to use their inhalers, like face-to-face training, using videos or computer games, and using devices that give feedback on how well they are using the inhaler. The results showed that some of these ways helped people use their inhalers better, but it was hard to tell which way was the best because the studies were all different. The study also found that teaching people how to use their
Three small tests with 226 people were done. One test had patients with a certain type of stroke without a special scan, and the other two tests had patients with a different type of stroke with the scan. They couldn't find information about how many people died or had problems after the tests. They also couldn't find any differences between the group that got a medicine called mannitol and the group that didn't. They didn't know if there were any bad things that happened because of the tests. They found that the people who got mannitol didn't get better or worse than the people who didn't get it. They couldn't prove
In a study, six tests were done with 425 people taking a medicine called D-penicillamine and 258 people taking a fake medicine called a placebo. The results showed that D-penicillamine helped people with joint pain, overall pain, and other problems better than the fake medicine. This was true for all different amounts of the medicine. However, more people stopped taking D-penicillamine because of bad side effects, like kidney and blood problems. D-penicillamine seems to help people with a condition called rheumatoid arthritis, but it can also cause more problems than other similar medicines. It is not clear
We looked at four tests about a special plant mixture called Huangqi. These tests were not very good quality. They studied how Huangqi helped people who were getting strong medicine for their sickness. When people took Huangqi with their medicine, they felt less sick and had more healthy blood cells. Huangqi also helped their body's defense system. But, it didn't change some other parts of their body's defense. Even though the tests were not very good, they showed that Huangqi might help people feel better when they take strong medicine. We didn't find any bad things about using this plant mixture. We need better tests to learn more
We looked at many studies about using vitamins A and DHA to help people with a vision problem called RP. We found three good studies with 866 people, aged 4 to 55 years old. One study tested vitamin A, another tested DHA, and the last one tested both vitamins together. We couldn't find all the details about these studies, so we don't know if they might be a little bit wrong. We didn't combine the results of the studies because they were too different. After one year, none of the studies showed that the vitamins helped people see better. No one had bad side effects from the vitamins.
We looked at three studies with 414 people who might lose their jobs. Most of these people had a type of arthritis called IA, with some having RA and a few having AS. The studies tried to help these people keep their jobs and work better by making changes at work and giving them advice or education. There were some visits to the workplace and help from doctors, but not much. The studies were different in how long they lasted and what they did. All the people in the studies went to clinics for their arthritis. The studies looked at job loss, missing work, and how well people could work. We found that the studies were
We looked at three studies with 285 babies from three countries. The studies were good quality. They showed that giving a special thing called arginine to very young babies can help protect them from a sickness called NEC. This was true for different levels of NEC. Arginine also helped lower the chance of babies dying from NEC. But, it did not change the chance of babies dying from other causes. The studies did not find any bad side effects from giving arginine to the babies. We need more research with more babies to know if we should give arginine to all very young babies to protect them from NEC.
We did not find any new tests for this update. We looked at four studies with 1,943 people who had a sinus infection. These studies tested if a medicine called INCS helped people feel better. They compared people who took INCS to people who took a fake medicine (placebo) or did nothing for 15 or 21 days. The studies showed that people who took INCS felt better more often than those who took the fake medicine (73% vs. 66.4%). Taking a higher dose of INCS helped even more. There were no big problems or side effects from taking INCS, and people did
Giving a special medicine called vancomycin to very young babies helped to lower the chances of them getting sick from harmful germs. The medicine did not cause any big problems, and it did not make the babies stay in the hospital longer. However, there is not enough information to know if using this medicine could cause other problems, like making germs stronger and harder to treat. The way the studies were done might have also affected the results. Right now, it seems that giving vancomycin to all very young babies is not a good idea.
We found 14 studies about different bandages and creams for healing wounds after surgery. One study showed that aloe vera might slow down healing, but we can't be sure because many people didn't finish the study. A special cast helped wounds heal faster after an amputation compared to a stretchy bandage. Other bandage types (like foam and alginate) didn't show a big difference in healing time. Gauze bandages caused more pain than other types of bandages. People using gauze were also less happy with their treatment. Gauze is cheap, but it takes more time for nurses to use compared
In 2014, we looked at 11 tests about birth control and breastfeeding. These tests included 1482 women. Some tests were about birth control pills, and others were about different birth control methods. Most tests did not find big differences in how long women breastfed, what was in their breast milk, or how their babies grew. Some older tests found a few differences, but they did not give a lot of information. We need more tests to know if certain birth control methods affect breastfeeding or not.
We looked at 10 studies from Australia, Singapore, and the USA about red-light cameras. These studies were different in how they checked for certain effects. One study that checked for both effects showed that red-light cameras helped reduce crashes by 29%. Other studies that checked for some effects also showed that red-light cameras helped, but not as much. Some studies didn't check for these effects, and their results were not as clear. Overall, red-light cameras seem to help reduce crashes. But we need more and better studies to be sure.
This text talks about a study with 494 people in four different trials. They looked at how well a medicine called warfarin worked by day five. They found that using 10-mg of warfarin helped more people than using 5-mg, but the results were not the same for everyone. Some people did better with 10-mg, some with 5-mg, and some saw no difference. They also looked at side effects like bleeding and how long people stayed in the hospital. They found no big differences between the two doses. The study had some problems because the people in it were different and the trials
We looked at seven studies with 555 people. These studies tested different ways to take care of older people with hip fractures. Some of the people in the studies had memory problems or dementia. The studies checked how well people did after their hip fractures. They looked at things like how well people could do everyday tasks and how long they stayed in the hospital. We found that some new ways of taking care of people with hip fractures might help them get better faster. These new ways might help people with memory problems not get more confused after their hip fracture. They might also help people leave the hospital sooner. But we are not sure about these results
We looked at 4226 titles and found seven studies with 840 people. These studies had different people, treatments, and results. There were no big changes in health, but two studies showed shorter hospital stays without more people coming back to the hospital. Three studies showed less worry for parents and better behavior in kids. Parents were happier in three studies. One study showed better family life. But, one study each said there was no change in how hard it was for parents or how well kids did. Home care cost more for service providers but saved money for families in two studies. One study said there was no big money savings for families
In 2016, researchers looked at more studies and information about a way to help people with serious mental illnesses. This method is called Intensive Case Management (ICM). They studied how ICM compared to regular care and another type of care called non-ICM. They found that ICM might help people spend less time in the hospital and stay in the program longer compared to regular care. But, they were not sure if ICM helped people find jobs or feel better overall. When they compared ICM to non-ICM, they found that there might not be a big difference between the two. The researchers think that I
This text talks about a study that looked at how well box training helps people learn to do surgery. Box training is a way to practice surgery skills without using real patients. The study found that people who did box training got better at surgery skills than those who didn't. They were faster, made fewer mistakes, and had better overall scores. The study also looked at different ways to do box training, but there wasn't a big difference between them. The study says we need more research to see if box training really helps people become better surgeons in the long run.
Two medical studies were looked at. One study had 17 patients and compared two treatments. The first treatment had more side effects and didn't help, so the study stopped. The second study had 18 patients and compared two different treatments. One treatment made a blood test result higher, but no other big differences were found. There is no proof that a certain medicine works for a specific liver problem. Using this medicine through a special tube can cause bad side effects.
We looked at 11 tests. Seven tests studied when to give help with food (early or late). We got information about how many people died in all seven tests (284 people). The chance of dying with early food help was 0.67 (95% chance it's between 0.41 and 1.07). We got information about how many people had problems doing things in three tests. The chance of dying or having problems was 0.75 (95% chance it's between 0.50 and 1.11). Seven tests compared two ways of giving food. Because early help often uses one way,
We looked at 57 studies with 34,390 people in them. These studies tested if using a computer program or app could help people drink less alcohol. We found that people who used these digital tools drank about 3 less drinks per week than those who didn't use them. This is good evidence that digital tools can help people drink less. We also looked at 5 small studies that compared digital tools to talking to someone in person about drinking less. There wasn't a big difference between the two methods. This means that digital tools might work just as well as talking to someone in person. Some things that helped people drink less were
We looked at 24 studies with 4233 people to see if a medicine called benzodiazepines helps with panic disorders. We found that benzodiazepines might work better than a fake medicine (placebo), but the studies were not very good. Some people had side effects from the medicine, and we don't know if it works well in the long run. Doctors should think about other medicines and what the patient wants when choosing a treatment.
We looked at 13 small studies and three ongoing studies about tai chi. These studies had different people, like healthy people, older people, and people with high blood pressure. The studies were short and had some problems. They checked things like blood pressure and cholesterol, but the results were not the same for all studies. Some studies showed that tai chi helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but others did not. Only one study checked if tai chi made people feel better, and it did. We don't know if tai chi can help prevent heart problems because there is not enough information. We need more good studies to find out.
We looked at 27 studies about ways to help families stop kids from smoking. These studies were different in many ways, like the age of the kids and how long the study lasted. Most of the studies were done in the USA, with a few in Europe, Australia, and India. We found that family-based programs can help prevent kids from starting to smoke. These programs work best when they are intense and focus on good parenting. Good parenting means caring for the child and setting rules, not just telling them what to do or not paying attention to them. These programs usually start when kids are between 11 and 14 years old.
Three studies with 451 people were looked at. They tested a medicine called dexamethasone to see if it helped with nausea (feeling sick). The studies lasted from one to two weeks. Two studies (with 127 people) were combined to see how well the medicine worked after eight days. The medicine seemed to help a little, but it was not a big difference. There were no big problems with side effects. It was hard to compare the studies because they used different ways to measure nausea and different medicines. There was not enough information to see if the medicine worked better for certain types of cancer. The quality of the
We looked at 10 studies about giving medicine to kids who might easily get sick with lung infections. These kids had different health problems like HIV, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, cancer, and breathing issues from being born too early. The studies lasted from one week to three years. The results were mixed. Some medicines helped lower the chance of getting sick, going to the hospital, or dying. But other medicines didn't make a big difference. There were no big problems from taking the medicines, but we don't know if they caused the germs to become stronger. We need more studies to see if these medicines can
We looked at nine studies with 519 people to see if different gases used in belly surgeries are safe and helpful. The gases we looked at were nitrous oxide, helium, and room air, compared to carbon dioxide. We found that there is not enough information to know if nitrous oxide or helium are better or worse than carbon dioxide for heart and lung problems or pain after surgery. There were no serious problems with nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide. With helium, there were three serious problems. One study looked at room air and found less pain and lower hospital costs compared to carbon dioxide, but we need more information to be sure. We
This text talks about 14 studies that looked at a medicine called dexamethasone. They wanted to see how different amounts and times of giving the medicine affected babies who were born too early. The studies found that some ways of giving the medicine might be better than others, but they are not sure which is the best way. They need to do more research with bigger groups of babies to find the best way to use this medicine.
This text talks about a review of old studies that looked at different medicines for heart problems in people with a sickness called acute rheumatic fever. The studies compared different medicines like corticosteroids and aspirin. The results showed that there was not much difference between the medicines in helping the heart. But, the studies were old and might not be very accurate, so we should be careful with the results. New studies should be done to see if these medicines or other new ones can help people with this sickness. Better ways to check the heart can also help us understand the results better.
We looked at six studies with 12,294 people from 79 places. Two studies showed that using bug spray helped reduce a sickness called trachoma by 55% to 61%. But, another study said bug spray didn't help. One study found that having toilets helped reduce trachoma by 29.5%, but this wasn't a big enough difference and another study didn't agree. Another study said teaching people about health helped, but a different study didn't find the same thing. All the studies had some problems. There is a little proof that bug spray helps, but not in all cases. Two studies about
We looked at 15 studies with 1043 people who have CFS. We compared CBT to usual care and other therapies like relaxation, counseling, and education/support. CBT helped reduce tiredness better than usual care and might be better than other therapies. But, we need more studies to know for sure. We also need more studies to see if CBT works well with other treatments for people with CFS.
A study with 46 people who have sickle cell disease was done to see if taking vitamin D helps them. Some people left the study, so only 39 people were part of it. They were given either vitamin D or a fake pill (placebo) for six weeks and were checked for six months. The study found that the people who took vitamin D had higher levels of it in their blood and had less pain than those who took the placebo. However, the study was not very good because some people left and there were other problems. So, we cannot say for sure if taking vitamin D is helpful for people with sickle
This text talks about a study that looked at how to help kids aged 4 to 12 who have trouble speaking clearly. The study was done in Australia and tested two different ways to help these kids. They found that both ways helped the kids speak better after one month. However, they couldn't say if one way was better than the other or if these ways were better than not doing anything at all. They also didn't look at how well the kids could communicate in real life. More studies are needed to learn more about how to help kids with speaking problems.
Four tests with 268 people were done to see if certain medicines could help with eye problems. All four tests used medicine taken by mouth. One test was done in Brazil with adults and kids, but it had some problems. The other three tests compared the medicine to a fake pill. These tests also had some problems because they didn't explain things well. One test in the US used a medicine called pyrimethamine-trisulfapyrimidine for eight weeks. Another test in the UK used pyrimethamine for four weeks. The last test in Brazil used trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months
We looked at 43 studies about older people with mostly hip fractures. We compared different ways to fix the fractures. One way, called the Gamma nail, had more problems and needed more surgeries. Another way, called the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS), also had more problems. But, both of these ways were similar to the sliding hip screw (SHS) in other things like infections, how long people lived, and how well they could move after surgery. We also looked at other ways to fix the fractures, like the proximal femoral nail (PFN) and different nail and plate methods. We didn't find
We looked at 183 articles and found 22 that might help us learn about treating a problem in the stomach for women with ovarian cancer. Only one article had the information we needed. It talked about 47 women who got two different treatments. Some had surgery, and some took a medicine called Octreotide. The women who had surgery lived longer, but some had serious problems or even died because of the surgery. We don't know how much better their lives were or all the side effects they had. We need more information to know which treatment is better and who it might help the most. Right now, there is only a little
Four tests were done with 244 women who have PCOS. They took two different medicines for 6 or 12 weeks. The medicines didn't help with their periods, ovulation, hair growth, or acne. They also didn't change their weight. But the medicines did lower their testosterone levels and helped with some types of cholesterol. No bad side effects happened. The medicines didn't fix all the problems, so more research is needed.
We looked at 1522 articles about stopping bleeding in women with a sickness called cervical cancer. We didn't find any new studies since the last time we checked. We only found information from single studies, not from comparing different treatments. There is no proof that one treatment is better than another. The best treatment depends on what is available in the area. Some places don't have the best tools to help these women. We need more research to find the best way to help them.
Three studies with 745 patients looked at using temozolomide and radiotherapy together versus just radiotherapy for a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Temozolomide helped patients live longer and slowed down the cancer growth when used with radiotherapy. However, it also caused more side effects like tiredness and infections. In another study, temozolomide did not make a big difference in patients' quality of life. For patients with a different type of brain cancer called recurrent HGG, two studies with 672 patients showed that temozolomide did not help
We looked at two studies. One study in Cambodia showed that working with international groups might help people use health care more. It made more people use care for pregnant women and public health centers. But, it didn't make people healthier. The other study showed that giving health managers special training might help them do their job better. In three countries, managers who didn't get the training had more problems than those who did. We didn't find any studies about how to keep health managers working in their jobs. We need more information to know if these ideas work well in different places. There are other ways to help health managers that we haven't
We looked at three studies with 123 people. They compared surgery to medicine, but it was hard to keep the groups secret. Two studies didn't explain how they picked the groups. All three studies talked about people who died, and some people died in two of the studies. We couldn't tell if there was a difference in deaths between the groups. Six people died from different causes. People who had surgery had less pneumonia, chest problems, and breathing help. We looked at how long people needed machines to breathe, stayed in the ICU, and stayed in the hospital. We couldn't put the results together because they were different. Some
A study looked at how well a medicine called cerivastatin worked in 12,877 people. These people had different ages and some had heart problems. The study lasted for three to 12 weeks. Cerivastatin helped lower bad cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol, and triglycerides in the blood. The medicine worked better at higher doses. Cerivastatin was stronger than other similar medicines like fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin. It did not have a big effect on good cholesterol (HDL), but it did increase it by 5%. Some people stopped taking
We looked at 28 studies with 6851 patients. These studies had a low chance of being wrong. They tested a method called remote ischaemic preconditioning to see if it helps patients after surgery. This method did not make a big difference in patients' kidney health or how long they stayed in the hospital. It also did not change the number of patients who needed dialysis or who passed away. Only a few patients had serious problems from this method. Remote ischaemic preconditioning seems safe, but we are not sure if it really helps patients after major heart and blood vessel surgeries.
We looked at 12,490 articles and chose 12 studies with 703 people. Eight studies tested if treatments helped with tiredness after a stroke. They tried five medicines, a class about tiredness, and a stress-relief program. People who got the treatments felt less tired than those who didn't (244 people, -1.07 score). But, the studies were very different from each other. When we looked at better-designed studies, the treatments didn't seem to help as much. No study tested if treatments could prevent tiredness after a stroke. Four studies tested other treatments for stroke symptoms, but they didn't help
Three studies looked at treatments for a condition called hyperkalaemia in 74 young babies born early. The studies were small and not perfect. One study found that using glucose and insulin might help lower the risk of death, but more research is needed. Another study found that a treatment called albuterol inhalation helped lower a certain level in the blood. No bad side effects were found with these treatments. Other treatments have not been studied yet. Because the studies were small and not perfect, we can't make strong recommendations for doctors. More research is needed to find the best treatment for hyperkalaemia in young babies born early
This text talks about a study that looked at different treatments for a health problem. They found that two treatments, called IVIg and PE, worked about the same for most people. They also found that IVIg might help children get better faster than just giving them regular care. They didn't find any big differences in side effects between the treatments, but more people finished the IVIg treatment than the PE treatment. The study also said that more research is needed to learn about the best way to use these treatments, especially for people with mild symptoms or who start treatment later.
We looked at 28 studies with 9330 people to see if giving more oxygen during surgery helps patients. We found that giving more oxygen did not make a big difference in how many people died or got infections after surgery. In some cases, giving more oxygen might even be harmful. We need more research to know for sure if giving more oxygen during surgery is helpful or not.
This text talks about a study that looked at how well antibiotics work for children with ear problems. They found that antibiotics can help some children get better, but they can also cause side effects like diarrhea, vomiting, or skin rash. The study also found that antibiotics might not help with other things like hearing, speech, or quality of life. It is important to think about the good and bad effects of antibiotics before using them for ear problems.
We looked at twelve studies about eating less protein for people with diabetes. One study found that eating less protein might help people with kidney problems, but we need more research to be sure. For people with type 1 diabetes, eating less protein didn't make a big difference. For people with type 2 diabetes, the results were mixed. In one study, people who ate less protein didn't have better kidney health than those who didn't change their diet. We don't know if eating less protein affects how people feel or how much it costs. We need more research to find out the best amount of protein for people with diabetes to eat
We looked at 19 studies with 3480 people. Some studies were good, and some were not as good. For people with mild brain injuries, getting the right information helps them get better without needing extra help. For people with more serious injuries, special help is important. Starting help early can lead to better results. For people already getting help, doing more can help them improve faster. Continuing help after leaving the hospital can also be good. Different people need different kinds of help. People with mild injuries need the right information and advice. People with more serious injuries need special help and should be checked on regularly. Starting help early can
We looked at one study with 176 women. The study had four groups and looked at two things: where the baby stayed and what the baby wore. We put three groups together as one group (rooming-in) and the fourth group was the control (separate care). We looked at how long the moms breastfed their babies. The study found that most moms breastfed for about four months, and there was no difference between the groups. The study did not tell us how many babies were only breastfed at six months old. There was also no difference in how many babies were still being breastfed at six months old between the
We looked at eight tests with 660 people. Most of the tests were not very good. In six tests, we checked on the people for less than a month. Only two tests showed how many people were still sick or needed help after 28 days. The group that took sanchi did better than the group that didn't (they had a 0.63 chance of getting better). One test said that the sanchi group had better scores on a test called the Barthel index. When we put seven tests together, it seemed like sanchi might help people with brain problems more than not taking it (with a
We looked at 14 studies about dental implants, but only 7 were good enough to use. Four studies checked when to put in the implants. Two studies with 126 people found no big differences between putting implants in right away or waiting. One study with 46 people found that putting implants in a little later made people happier and had better results after 2 years, but after 5 years, there was no difference and more problems happened. One study with 16 people found no differences between putting implants in right away or a little later. Three studies looked at different ways to add bone for implants put in right after taking out a
Two tests were done on medicines called PBT1 and PBT2 to see if they help people with Alzheimer's disease. In the first test, PBT1 was given to some patients and a fake medicine (placebo) was given to others. After 36 weeks, there was no big difference between the two groups in how well they could think. One person had some problems with their eyes, but it got better when they stopped taking the medicine. In the second test, PBT2 was given to some people and a placebo to others. After 12 weeks, there was no big difference in how well they could think or
We looked at 36 studies with 2999 people who had lung-related high blood pressure. The studies lasted about 14 weeks, but some were as long as 12 months. Two studies had kids in them. People who took a certain medicine (PDE5 inhibitors) got better in some ways compared to those who didn't take the medicine. But, they also had more side effects like headaches, stomach problems, red faces, and muscle and joint pain. There were not many studies comparing this medicine to other treatments. The medicine seemed to help people with one type of lung-related high blood pressure, but not others. More research
We added a new test with 45 people to our study. In total, we looked at 22 tests with 2193 people who had numbing medicine for hand, wrist, forearm, or elbow surgery. We checked if the tests were done well and found some problems with hiding which treatment people got. We found that giving more numbing shots worked better than giving just one or two shots. More shots helped people feel less pain and have better muscle control. It also took less time to give one or two shots, but there was no difference in how long it took to get ready for surgery. Our study shows that giving more num
We looked at 159 articles and found three studies about a medicine called beclomethasone for kids with mild to medium asthma. The medicine was given two times a day using a special device called a Diskhaler. The studies lasted 7-12 months. In all three studies, kids who took the medicine grew less than kids who didn't. On average, they grew 1.54 cm less per year. We don't know if this effect lasts or if kids will grow more after they stop taking the medicine. We can't say if other similar medicines have the same effect. If a child needs this medicine for
Three tests with 139 people were studied. They looked at two different treatments, APD and CAPD, to see if one was better than the other. They found that there was no big difference between the two treatments in how well they worked or how many problems they caused. One study found that people using APD had fewer infections and hospital visits. Another study found that people using APD had more time for work, family, and fun activities. APD might be better for some people, like younger people or those with jobs or school. More research is needed to know for sure which treatment is better and how much they cost.
We looked at 37 studies with 9312 patients to see which treatment works best for a sickness called HD. There are different treatments like RT, CRT, CT, IF-RT, and EF-RT. We found that CRT works better than RT and CT for most patients, especially in the early stages of the sickness. But for patients with more advanced sickness, CRT helps stop it from getting worse, while CT alone causes fewer problems. RT alone has more risks because it needs extra help to work. We couldn't find a big difference between IF-RT and EF-RT. We need to be careful with these results because some
We looked at 26 studies about pain medicine with 4893 people in them. The studies tested different ways to give the medicine: by mouth, through the skin, or into the spine. Some people stopped taking the medicine because of side effects or because it didn't help their pain enough. Only a few people got addicted to the medicine. The studies showed that the medicine helped with pain, but it was different for each study. We don't know if the medicine helped people feel better overall or do more things because there wasn't enough information. Some people had small side effects like feeling sick or having a headache, but big problems were
This text talks about a study with 212 people who had spinal cord injuries and serious skin sores. Most of them were men around 57-58 years old. The study tested if a medicine called oxandrolone could help heal the sores better than a fake medicine (placebo). After 24 weeks, they couldn't tell if oxandrolone really helped or not because the results were not clear. They also looked at side effects and couldn't tell if oxandrolone caused more or less serious problems. The study didn't talk about other things like pain, how long people stayed in the hospital, or how
We looked at six studies with 8372 people. All studies had some problems. Four studies compared email to regular mail, and two compared email to normal care. For the main goal of getting people to do health check-ups, there was no difference between email and regular mail. There was also no difference in how well patients or caregivers understood and supported each other. The results were not clear for how patients or caregivers acted. For email compared to normal care, there was no big difference in how healthy and happy patients were. No information was given about healthcare workers or any problems. The proof for using email to share health information was weak,
This text talks about a study that looked at 11 different tests with 855 people. They were trying to see if a special movement called the Epley manoeuvre could help people with a type of dizziness called BPPV. They also wanted to see if adding extra steps or movements would make the treatment better. The study found that the Epley manoeuvre worked well for about 80% of the people. Adding extra steps, like wearing a neck collar and sleeping upright, helped a little bit more, but not a lot. These extra steps didn't cause any big problems for most people, but some had minor issues
This text talks about four studies with 231 people that looked at different treatments for a nose problem called chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The treatments included surgery, steroids, and antibiotics. The studies compared how well the treatments worked and how they affected people's lives. The results showed that there was no big difference between the treatments in how people felt or how their lives were affected. The quality of the evidence from these studies is not very good, so it is hard to say which treatment is better. Some people had problems after the treatments, like nosebleeds, but these were not very common. In conclusion, more research
We looked at eight studies with 709 people from different countries where not having enough zinc is a problem. These studies tested if adding zinc to food helps people. Some studies compared food with added zinc to food without it, and others compared food with added zinc and other nutrients to food with just the other nutrients. The studies lasted between one and nine months. We found that adding zinc to food increased the amount of zinc in people's blood. However, it didn't make a big difference in their weight or height. When zinc was added to food with other nutrients, it didn't change the amount of zinc in people's blood much. We
This text talks about a study that looked at how well a certain medicine works for people with a serious type of cancer called advanced prostate cancer. The study found that this medicine might not work as well as other treatments, and it can cause some side effects. The researchers think that more studies should be done to learn more about how this medicine works for people with a less serious type of prostate cancer. They also think that it might not be necessary to study this medicine for people with the most serious type of prostate cancer.
We looked at eight tests to see if checking for breast cancer helps save lives. We didn't use one test because it wasn't done right. In the tests, 600,000 women between 39 and 74 years old were checked. Some tests were done well, and some were not. The good tests didn't show that checking for breast cancer saved lives. The not-so-good tests showed that it did help a little. We found that counting how many women died from breast cancer wasn't the best way to see if the tests worked. The good tests didn't show that checking for breast cancer helped lower the number of women who
We looked at four studies with 522 women. One study did not give enough information, so we only used three studies. These studies looked at how a medicine called hCG helps women get pregnant. Some women had more hCG, some had less, and some had none. Most of the women in the studies had a health problem called PCOS. We found that the studies were not very clear and had some problems. When we compared women who had hCG to those who did not, we did not see a big difference in having a baby, having a miscarriage, or getting pregnant. We think that maybe hCG could make
In a study, 24 tests were done, but only 16 had useful information. The tests looked at two treatments, ERT and HRT, to see if they could help older women think better. After a few years, the treatments did not help and sometimes made thinking worse. Smaller tests also did not show any benefits. There is strong proof that ERT and HRT do not help older women think better when used for a short or long time (up to five years). It is not known if certain types of ERT or HRT work better for some women. More research is needed to see if things like age
We looked at two studies with 880 people. These studies were about people with a lung problem called COPD. The studies tested two different inhalers to see which one works better. The inhalers were used for 12 weeks. The results showed that we are not sure which inhaler is better because the evidence is not strong enough. We need more studies and more information to know for sure.
This text talks about a study that looked at different treatments for a problem called BDD. They found that two types of treatments, called SRIs and CBT, might be helpful. But, they need to do more studies to make sure these treatments work well for different people, like teenagers.
Three tests were done on 268 grown-ups to see if a medicine called cotrimoxazole helps them. The results showed that using a special method called "desensitization" was better than another method called "rechallenge" for keeping people on the medicine and having fewer bad reactions. No one had a very bad reaction in these tests. The tests showed that for people with HIV who had problems with cotrimoxazole before, the desensitization method worked better. More tests are needed, especially for kids and in places with fewer resources.
We looked at three studies with 148 newborn babies. These studies tested if a medicine called midazolam helps babies feel more relaxed. The babies who got midazolam were more relaxed than the ones who didn't. But, we don't know if this medicine works well for very young babies. Babies who got midazolam stayed in the hospital longer. One study showed that babies felt less pain with midazolam. Another study found more health problems in babies who got midazolam compared to another medicine. We think these studies are okay, but not perfect. We don't have enough information to say if
This text talks about a study with 12 tests and 767 people. They wanted to see if antibiotics helped people with a certain type of diarrhea. They found that antibiotics did not make a big difference in how long people were sick or had diarrhea. Some people who took antibiotics had fewer bad germs in their poop during the first week, but they were more likely to still have the same germs a month later. People who took antibiotics also had more side effects. The study says that antibiotics might not be helpful for this type of diarrhea in healthy people, but they are not sure about very young, very old, or very sick people
We looked at 23 studies with 4192 people to see how well a test called IL-6 can find a serious illness called sepsis in adults. There were many differences between the people in the studies, like their age, where they lived, and what kind of sickness they had. The number of people with sepsis in the studies was different too, from 12% to 78%. We found that the studies had some problems, so we couldn't say for sure how well the IL-6 test works. But we guessed that if we tested 1000 adults who might have sepsis, the IL
We looked at 29 studies with 5718 people. Most of these studies had unclear or high risk of bias. The studies were about different types of surgeries and how to cover the wounds after surgery. There were 4 studies that compared using a dressing to not using one, and 25 studies that compared different types of dressings. We are not sure if using a dressing or not, or which type of dressing is best for preventing infections, improving scars, reducing pain, or making patients feel better. Most of the studies were small and not very clear. Based on what we know now, people making decisions about how to cover a
We looked at two studies about pregnant women taking special vitamins to see if they could help prevent feeling very sad after giving birth (called postnatal depression). In the first study, some women took a vitamin called selenium, and others took a fake pill (placebo). The study found that selenium might help a little, but not enough to be sure. Some women didn't finish the study, so we don't know if it would have worked better if they did. In the second study, women took two different kinds of fish oil vitamins (EPA and DHA) or a fake pill. This study found that neither EPA nor D
We looked at 11 studies about a medicine called anthracycline. Seven studies checked how long the medicine should be given, and four studies checked how much medicine should be given at once. Most people in these studies were adults with different types of cancer. We found that giving the medicine for six hours or more can lower the chance of heart problems. But, we need more information about how this works for kids. We also found that giving a certain amount of the medicine at once didn't make a big difference in heart problems. We need more research to understand this better, for both kids and adults with different types of cancer.
We looked at 37 tests with 3110 people in them. Nine of these tests were new since 2009, and five tests were added in 2017. We found two more tests that are still going on. The tests had both grown-ups and kids with head injuries. Most tests started treatment right away at the hospital and lasted for at least 24 hours. We looked at how many people died, had bad results, or got pneumonia. The tests had different results, so we couldn't put them all together. We also looked at how long the treatment lasted and how long the tests followed the people. The tests
Some studies with 519 people who were sad were looked at. These studies were very different from each other. Even though some studies showed good results, there isn't enough proof to say that family therapy works well for sadness. Only a few studies showed that family therapy is better than doing nothing or waiting. Right now, it's better to use other ways to help with sadness that we know work. We need more good studies to see if family therapy really helps.
Three tests with 206 people who had brain problems were studied. All three tests had a high chance of mistakes. The tests showed that a medicine called Duxil helped improve brain function. There was no information about behavior, death, or how well people did daily tasks. The tests also didn't talk about how people felt, their quality of life, or how hard it was for their caregivers. Because the tests had some problems and there were not many of them, we can't say for sure if Duxil is good for treating people with brain problems. We need better and bigger tests to know for sure.
We looked at seven studies with 960 people. The studies were not very good, and some had problems. The results were different in each study, so we can't be sure about the information. We found that putting a drain after a surgery helped to lower the chance of a fluid build-up and the need to remove fluid later. But, people with drains stayed in the hospital longer. There was no big difference in infection rates, fluid amounts, or other problems between people with and without drains.
We looked at eight studies with many people in them. These studies were about different types of research. We used a special scale to see how good the studies were. Some studies were really good, and some were just okay. The studies were about special things called flavonoids and how they might help stop a type of sickness called colorectal cancer. The results were confusing. Some studies said flavonoids helped, but others said they didn't. There were different kinds of flavonoids, and the results were mixed for each kind. For one type, called Flavan-3-ols, two studies said it might help stop colore
We looked at seven studies with 1,369 people. All the studies had some problems. We checked two ways to find out who responded slowly to the treatment. None of the studies talked about our main goals. But, they did talk about other goals. When the treatment lasted 72 weeks instead of 48 weeks, more people got better. The number of people who got sick again was lower when they were treated for 72 weeks. The length of treatment did not change how well people followed the treatment. In one study, there was no big difference in side effects between the two treatment groups. This review shows that treating people with
Two studies looked at how well a test called EUS works for finding out if people with pancreatic cancer can have surgery to remove the cancer. The studies had 34 people in total. The results showed that EUS is pretty good at telling if the cancer can be removed or not. But, there is still some doubt about how useful EUS is for people with pancreatic cancer. No studies have looked at how well EUS works for another type of cancer called periampullary cancer. So, we don't know if EUS should be used all the time for people with pancreatic or periampullary cancer.
We looked at 34 studies about a problem called blepharitis, which affects people's eyes. These studies had different ways of treating the problem, so it was hard to compare them. Some treatments, like using special eye drops and cleaning the eyelids, seemed to help a little. But we still don't know the best way to treat blepharitis. There are many products that claim to help with this problem, but we need more research to know if they really work. Future studies should be careful to compare different treatments and follow people for a long time to see if the treatments help in the long run.
We looked at one test with 23 people. The study had a high chance of being wrong. We didn't find much change between the groups (not very good proof). Some bad things happened, like a child having trouble breathing after the treatment. We don't have enough good information to know if this treatment helps people with a certain breathing problem. We need more tests with more people and longer time to see if it works. Future tests should also check if people feel better and have a better life after the treatment.
We looked at 42 studies with 4220 people. These studies tested two types of ultrasound: CDUS and CE-CDUS. The quality of the studies was not very high. We found that CE-CDUS was better than CDUS in finding problems. When we used a special dye (contrast), the results were even better. Both types of ultrasound were good at finding specific issues. CE-CDUS was better for finding a certain problem called endoleaks. We suggest using CE-CDUS first and then a CT scan if needed.
We looked at seven studies with 766 people. They all talked about back pain during childbirth. The studies were good, but some had problems. They all found that sterile water helped with pain, but we couldn't compare them because they used different ways to measure pain. No study talked about how well the treatment worked or how happy the women were with their pain relief. There was no big difference between using sterile water and salt water for things like how the baby was born or how healthy the baby was. Some women said they would use sterile water again for pain relief. No bad things happened, but the injection hurt more with sterile water.
This text talks about a study that looked at how using glue instead of stitches can help people feel less pain after a surgery to fix a hernia. They looked at 12 different smaller studies with 1932 people in total. They found that using glue helped reduce pain by 37% compared to using stitches. But, when they looked at different types of mesh used in the surgery, the results were different. With lightweight mesh, the pain reduction was less and not very important. With heavyweight mesh, using glue was much better. The number of hernias coming back was about the same for both glue and stitches. Using glue was better
We found 32 studies about editing and 66 studies about checking facts in articles. Only three of these studies were very well-done. Some editing processes made articles easier to read and better quality in a few studies, but one study had mixed results. Stronger editing helped reduce mistakes in summaries and facts. Giving authors instructions helped improve reporting of rules in one study and reduced mistakes in facts in two studies, but it didn't change the quality of summaries in one very well-done study. Organizing information made summaries better but longer. The studies about checking facts found that 38% of facts were wrong and 20% of quotes were wrong
We looked at 15 studies with 721 people who had cancer pain. All the studies were done on adults, not children. The studies were good but had some problems because they were small and had missing information. Most of the studies used a medicine called codeine, sometimes with another medicine called paracetamol. They compared it to a fake medicine (placebo) or other real medicines. The studies showed that codeine helped with cancer pain better than the fake medicine, but it also caused some side effects like feeling sick, throwing up, and having trouble going to the bathroom. We don't know how long the medicine works or
This text talks about a study that looked at 12 different tests with 563 people who have a blood condition called sickle cell disease. The people in the study were between 6 and 35 years old, and most of them were African-American. The study wanted to see if teaching people about their disease would help them understand it better and feel less sad. The study found that teaching people about sickle cell disease did help them understand it better, and it also helped them feel less sad. However, the study did not find any big changes in how well people were able to take care of themselves or how often they needed to go
The text talks about a review of six studies with 2411 people. These studies looked at how well a medicine called brivaracetam works for people with a health problem called epilepsy. Epilepsy causes seizures, which are sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain. Most of the studies looked at people with one type of seizure, but one study looked at people with two types of seizures. The people in the studies were adults between 16 and 80 years old. The studies lasted from 7 to 16 weeks. The review found that brivaracetam helped reduce seizures and even stop them for some people. But,
We looked at 38 studies about what parents think of vaccine information. Most of these studies were from rich countries. Some were about the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. Parents wanted more information than they got. Not having enough information made some parents worried and unsure about their choices. They wanted clear and simple information about the good and bad things about vaccines. They also wanted information that was right for their situation. Parents wanted to find vaccine information in more places and before their vaccine appointments. They thought health workers were important for giving information, but sometimes bad communication made it hard to decide about vaccines. Parents
We looked at 10 studies with 599 people who have anorexia nervosa. Seven of these studies were in a previous review, and we added three new ones. We found that some treatments work better than others, but we can't say for sure which ones are best. Two of the studies included kids. The studies had different types of therapy, and it was hard to compare them. Some studies had problems, like not enough information or not being very clear. One type of therapy, called focal psychodynamic therapy, might work better than regular treatment from a doctor who doesn't specialize in eating disorders. But we need more research
This text talks about a review of three studies with 516 people. These studies looked at different ways to treat a problem with the eye called RD. They tested silicone oil, perfluropropane gas, and sulfur hexafluoride gas. The results showed that all three treatments worked similarly for many cases. There were no big differences in how well people could see or if their eye problem got better after one year. In one study, heavy silicone oil was not better than standard silicone oil. There were no big differences in how well people could see after one year. Some people had problems after the treatment, but the text does
We looked at five studies with 1819 women. These studies showed that planning an early delivery for women with high blood pressure during pregnancy can be safer for the mother. Early delivery can lower the risk of some health problems for the mother, like HELLP syndrome and severe kidney problems. But, we don't have enough information to know if early delivery is better or worse for the baby. Some babies born early had breathing problems and needed to stay in the hospital's special care unit. There was no big difference in how many women had a C-section or how long the mother and baby stayed in the hospital after birth. We need more studies
Six studies with 142 people were looked at. They studied how to help kids with hemophilia, a blood disorder. They found that giving medicine three times a week helped reduce bleeding, especially in the joints. Some studies showed that this treatment helped keep joints healthy for a longer time. Other studies looked at different ways to give the medicine, but they couldn't find the best way. They also found that some people had more problems when getting the medicine, like infections. Overall, giving medicine regularly helps kids with hemophilia have better joint health. More studies are needed to find the best way to give the medicine and help adults with hemophilia
We added one new study to this update. In total, 13 tests with 1824 people were part of this review, but only 10 tests (732 people) had data we could use. Many tests did not explain their methods well, so it was hard to know if they were good quality. We couldn't combine the results because the tests were too different. Eight tests tried to make people better, but there was no big difference between the treatments. Five tests tried to keep people better. In two of the three tests that talked about survival, there was a big difference, but it wasn't a big enough difference between the
Two studies with 447 women were done. They looked at two ways of giving a special medicine called anti-D. The women got the medicine during their 28th week of pregnancy. The studies found that both ways of giving the medicine worked well. But, there were not enough women in the studies to know for sure. The best way to give the medicine depends on what is available and what the patient likes. More research is needed to know the best way to give this medicine.
We looked at eight studies with 21,379 people who have diabetes. These studies checked different medicines to see how well they work. Some studies looked at ticlopidine, while others looked at clopidogrel. All the studies had people who had heart problems before, except one study that had people with a higher chance of getting heart problems. The studies were good quality and lasted between 365 and 913 days. Only one study (with 355 people) had information about how many people died, had heart problems, or had a heart attack. This study compared ticlopidine to a fake medicine and found no big
Ten tests were done with 191 people to see if a special kind of breathing help called non-invasive ventilation works well for people with cystic fibrosis. This is a disease that makes it hard to breathe and get rid of mucus. The tests looked at different ways to use this breathing help, like during the day or at night. Some tests showed that non-invasive ventilation might make it easier for people with cystic fibrosis to clear their airways and they might like it better than other methods. It didn't help them get rid of more mucus, but it did help their lungs work better in some ways. Other
We looked at seven studies with 245 people to see if using a special breathing machine at night helps people with a lung problem called COPD. We checked how it affected their blood, walking, health, and sleep. The results were not clear, so we can't say for sure if the machine helps or not. We need more research to know the answer.
We looked at four studies with 1190 women to see if inducing labor for babies that might be too big is helpful. It was hard to tell if the studies were biased or not. We found that inducing labor did not change the chances of having a c-section or needing tools to help with delivery. However, it did lower the chances of shoulder problems and broken bones for the baby. There were no big differences in other baby health issues. The babies in the induced labor group weighed less on average, but the studies were very different from each other. In one study, women who had induced labor had more tears. We need more research
We looked at 159 studies about vitamin D and health. We found 56 studies with 95,286 people that gave us useful information. The people in the studies were between 18 and 107 years old, and most were women over 70 years old. The studies were done in rich countries. We found that vitamin D helped people live longer in all 56 studies. Vitamin D3, a type of vitamin D, helped lower the chance of dying from cancer. But, when vitamin D3 was combined with calcium, it increased the risk of kidney stones. Two other types of vitamin D, alfacalcidol and
We looked at many studies about three medicines called fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine. These medicines help people lose a little bit of weight over time. They also help with blood sugar levels. But, there can be some side effects like stomach problems, shaking, feeling sleepy, sweating, and heartbeats that feel weird. We also looked at other medicines, but we need more information to know if they work well. It is important to remember that these medicines only help a little bit with weight loss, and we don't know if they are good for our health in the long run.
Five studies with 734 people were looked at. One study was good, but the other four were not so good. It was hard to put all the information together because the studies didn't all look at the same things. There were no big differences between two medicines, VGB and CBZ, for stopping seizures and helping people feel better for six months. But, VGB made people have their first seizure faster than CBZ. People taking VGB gained more weight but had fewer skin rashes and felt less sleepy than those taking CBZ. There were no differences in eye problems. Right now, we don't know if VGB
We looked at four studies, but only two were finished and shared their results. These two studies had 600 people with certain blood cancers. They tested a medicine called plerixafor with another medicine called G-CSF. Some people got both medicines, and some got G-CSF with a fake medicine (placebo). The results showed that plerixafor helped collect more stem cells in a shorter time. But, we don't know if it affects how long people live or if it causes more side effects. The two finished studies were done by the company that makes plerixafor. There are more studies that haven't shared
We looked at 23 studies with 1806 women, and 717 of them used cones. The studies were small and hard to understand. The results were different and hard to put together. Some people stopped using cones and other treatments. Seven studies were only short summaries. Cones worked better than doing nothing. There wasn't much difference between cones and other treatments like PFMT and electrostimulation. We don't know if using cones and PFMT together is better than using them alone. Only seven studies talked about how the women felt, and none talked about money. Some studies had women with incontinence problems, while others had
We looked at 11 tests with 2246 people who have a heart problem called AF. The tests tried different ways to help them, like teaching, decision tools, and checking themselves with extra teaching. We are not sure if checking themselves with extra teaching is better than normal care. We found that teaching helps a little with feeling worried and sad. Decision tools did not help as much as normal care. We need more tests to know if these ways really help people with AF who take blood thinners. We also need to learn how these ways work and how they affect people's feelings over a long time.
This text talks about a study with 70 tests involving 11,487 women. They added 7 new tests with 778 women. These tests looked at different ways to help women give birth. They found that using a special medicine called PGE2 can help women give birth within 24 hours. But, it can also cause some problems like changes in the baby's heart rate. The number of women needing a C-section might be a little lower with this medicine. They are not sure if it helps the mom and baby in other ways. Different forms of PGE2 (tablets, gels, and pessaries)
We looked at 11 studies about babies and picked 5 of them with 247 babies. We compared babies in cots to babies in incubators. Their body temperatures were about the same, but babies in cots got too hot more often. Their weight gain was also about the same. Fewer babies in cots were breastfed and fewer passed away before leaving the hospital, but these differences were not big enough to be sure. We also compared cots with warm mattresses to incubators and got similar results. Babies in cots with warm rooms gained less weight in the first week, but after that, it was the same.
We looked at three studies with 146 people. Two studies might not be very accurate. We found that two methods work about the same for fixing a certain tooth problem (PDCs). One problem happened because a gold chain came off. One study talked about problems after surgery, like an infection and pain. We couldn't compare things like how teeth look, how much pain people felt, gum health, and how long treatment took. But, the studies didn't find any differences between the two methods. Right now, we don't know if one method is better than the other. We need more good studies to be sure. There are
We looked at three tests with 244 women. These tests might not be very accurate. They used special medicines called prostaglandins to help with a problem after giving birth. The medicines did not work much better than a fake medicine. They did not help much with removing the placenta, stopping heavy bleeding, needing a blood transfusion, or the time it took to remove the placenta. The side effects were the same, except for shivering, which happened more with the real medicine. We don't have enough information to say if these medicines are good or bad for this problem. We need more and better tests to find out
We looked at six studies with 355 babies. These studies used different ways to help babies breathe. We found that using a special pressure (CDP) can help babies and lower the risk of bad things happening. But, it can also increase the risk of a problem called pneumothorax. We didn't find any differences in other breathing problems or how the babies did when they were older. Some of these studies are old, so we need more research to know the best way to help babies breathe.
We looked at six studies with 157 people in total. We found that foam bandages do not help heal foot sores in people with diabetes better than regular bandages. We also found no big difference in healing when using foam or alginate bandages. There was no big difference in healing when using foam or hydrocolloid (matrix) bandages. All the studies were small and didn't last very long. Right now, we don't know if foam bandages are better for healing foot sores in people with diabetes than other bandages. People making decisions might think about the cost of the bandage and how well it helps
We looked at three tests. Two tests compared two different ways to treat a problem inside the body: using a special tool (endoscopic) or surgery. There were 111 people in these tests: 55 used the special tool and 56 had surgery. The surgery group had more people feel better from pain after a few years. Surgery also helped people have a better life and their body work better for a while, but not forever. There were no big differences in problems or deaths after the treatments, but we need more people in the tests to know for sure. One test had 32 people and compared surgery to a simple treatment.
In a study, 857 people had a small skin surgery. After the surgery, they were split into two groups. One group could take a bath after 12 hours (415 people), and the other group had to wait at least 48 hours (442 people) before taking a bath. The study looked at how many people got an infection after the surgery. There was no big difference between the two groups. About 8.5% of people in the first group and 8.8% in the second group got infections. Right now, we don't know if it's better to take a bath early or late after surgery
A study tested two medicines, prednisone and dexamethasone, to see if they help people with nerve problems. The study had some issues, so we are not sure if the results are accurate. The study found that prednisone helped some people, but it also had side effects. Another study compared prednisone and dexamethasone and found that they worked similarly, but dexamethasone had fewer side effects. Both medicines can cause serious problems if used for a long time. We need more research to understand how these medicines work and who they can help.
We looked at six studies with 2100 people to see if remote check-ups for asthma patients are as good as face-to-face check-ups. The studies had different types of people with asthma, but most were taking regular medications and did not have severe asthma. We couldn't tell if remote check-ups were better or worse than face-to-face check-ups because there wasn't enough information. In one study, more people in the remote check-up group needed extra medicine for their asthma, but we can't be sure if this is true for everyone. We also couldn't tell if remote check-ups were safer than face-to-face check-ups because not
Out of 16 studies, three were chosen because they met certain rules. These three studies had 212 people in them. They looked at how well people could do things, how happy they were, and how well they could breathe during exercise. The results showed that exercise might help, but it wasn't for sure. No bad things happened because of the exercise. There weren't many studies, so it's hard to know if this is true for everyone. All the studies agreed that exercise didn't make arthritis worse. There were many different ways to measure the results, so it would be good to have one way to measure them in the
We looked at 19 studies with 2663 people (some were outpatients, some were inpatients, and some were in the ICU). For outpatients with mild to moderate sickness, low-quality evidence shows that antibiotics help reduce the chance of treatment not working. Older antibiotics also helped, but they are not used anymore. One study showed that antibiotics did not affect how many people died or got sick again. Only one study talked about quality of life, but there was no big difference between the groups. For inpatients with severe sickness (not in the ICU), moderate-quality evidence shows that antibiotics did not help much, but the results are
We looked at nine studies with 1414 people (ages 24 to 70) who ate whole grains or less whole grains. We didn't find any studies that showed how whole grain diets affect heart health or heart problems. All the studies talked about how whole grains might change things like blood fats and blood pressure. The studies were not very clear and didn't last longer than 16 weeks. We didn't find any big differences between the two groups when it came to cholesterol. Some studies were paid for by cereal companies. We need better studies to know if whole grains help with heart health and other heart-related issues.
This text talks about a study that looked at different ways to help people heal after they hurt their ankle. They looked at 38 smaller studies with 1,896 people in them. They found that some things helped people feel better and move their ankle more easily, like using a special kind of brace that can be taken off and doing exercises. But, these things also had some risks, like causing more small problems. They also found that starting to put weight on the ankle after surgery helped a little bit. There wasn't much information about what kind of brace or support was best, and they didn't find any proof that stretching, massage
Four studies were looked at. Each study tested a different way to help people take their medicine. Two studies were done in countries with less money. Two studies were very well planned, and two were not as well planned. One study showed that having a nurse visit people at home helped them learn and get their medicine refills, but it didn't change their health. Another study showed that using a diary to track medicine didn't help people take their medicine better, but it didn't make a big difference. One study showed that a group therapy for teenagers didn't help them take their medicine better, but it did help their health. Another study
Five studies with 696 people were done to test different amounts of a medicine called fenoprofen and other medicines for pain relief. The people in the studies had pain from things like tooth removal, small surgeries, and other procedures. The best results came from using 200 mg of fenoprofen, which helped at least half of the people feel better for 4 to 6 hours. There wasn't enough information to know how well other amounts of the medicine worked or how safe it was. No serious problems or people stopping the medicine because of problems were reported in these studies.
Six tests were done, and three of them are new. Four tests were small (less than 25 women in each group) and two had a medium to high chance of mistakes. Four tests compared a special exercise for the pelvic floor muscles (PFMT) to help fix a problem called prolapse against a group that didn't do the exercise (857 women total). Two tests had women who had surgery for prolapse and compared the exercise with just having surgery (118 women total). In the tests comparing the exercise to no exercise, there was a chance of mistakes in two of them. The tests measured how the women felt and their results
This text talks about a study of ear infections and different treatments. They looked at 14 trials with 1,724 people. The study found that a type of medicine called quinolone antibiotics worked better than no treatment or using cleaning solutions. They also looked at other antibiotics, but the results were not as clear. The study did not find big differences between quinolone and other antibiotics. More research is needed to understand how well other antibiotics work and if there are any risks or side effects.
We looked at 21 studies with 6253 people (5515 were used in the results). These studies happened between 1974 and 2011, and most of them were in the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s. Many studies didn't explain their methods well and had some issues. In these studies, a test called FRS was used to tell if someone had schizophrenia or not. It was right about 57% to 61.8% of the time when comparing to other mental health problems. It was also right about 58% of the time when comparing to other types
We looked at 10 studies about treatments for a skin condition called atopic eczema in children. These treatments were added to the usual care and took place in doctor's offices and hospitals. There were 2003 kids in 9 studies about teaching and 44 kids in 1 study about mental health. Some studies had problems with their methods. We wanted to see if kids felt better, had less severe eczema, slept better, and had a better quality of life. No study talked about kids feeling better or sleeping better. The biggest and best study (with 992 kids) showed that the eczema got better
This text talks about a study with 14 trials and 753 people. The study found that a treatment called HBOT helped some people with certain health problems. It helped with healing in areas like the head, neck, and bottom. It also helped with healing after a tooth was taken out. But, it didn't help with healing nerves. More research is needed to find out who this treatment works best for and when to use it.
We found 10 studies with 2961 doctors doing different surgeries. They compared using blunt needles to sharp needles. Using blunt needles made it less likely for gloves to get holes and for doctors to get hurt by needles. Blunt needles were a bit harder to use, but still okay. The information is very good and shows that blunt needles are safer for doctors. It's not likely that new research will change this idea.
This text talks about a study that looked at two different types of medicine for people with mental health problems. They tested the medicines on 422 people in seven smaller studies. The studies lasted between 4 and 52 weeks and had 20 to 157 people in each one. The results showed that both medicines worked about the same, but one medicine called trifluoperazine caused more problems with movement. The studies were not very clear and did not give enough information, so more research is needed to know which medicine is better.
We looked at nine studies with 593 babies. These studies compared two ways of feeding babies born early: feeding them when they show signs of hunger and feeding them at set times. The studies were small and had some problems, like not being able to see everything clearly. Our results show that feeding babies when they show signs of hunger might make them gain weight a little slower and help them switch from tube feeding to mouth feeding a bit faster. But, we are not sure how important this is because the studies did not show a big change in how long the babies stayed in the hospital. The studies did not ask parents, caregivers, or hospital
We looked at two studies with 161 people in total. These studies did not talk about death or losing a limb. One study with 133 people showed that taking folic acid helped improve blood flow in the leg compared to not taking it. Another study with 18 people showed that taking a vitamin B supplement did not make a difference in blood flow. No big problems happened in these studies. Right now, we can't say if treating high levels of a certain substance in the blood is helpful for people with leg artery problems. We need more good studies to find out.
Two studies looked at how dentists work when they get paid in different ways. These studies included many dentists and patients, but the results might not be very accurate. One study found that when dentists got paid for each service, they did more work on teeth. But this study was only done in poor areas of Scotland, so it might not be true for other places. The other study compared two ways of paying dentists and found that when dentists got paid a set amount, they saw patients less often and did fewer treatments, but gave more advice on how to prevent tooth problems. We don't know which way of paying dent
We looked at 21 studies with over 17,000 women and their babies. These studies tested if giving extra zinc to pregnant women helped them and their babies. We found that giving zinc made a small difference in the number of babies born early, but it did not change the number of babies born with low weight. There were no big differences in other results between the women who took zinc and those who did not. The studies mostly included women with low incomes, so it might be more important to help improve their overall nutrition instead of just giving them extra zinc.
We looked at 10 studies with 1656 people, and none of these studies were paid for by medicine companies. All the studies used good bacteria (probiotics) along with antifungal drugs to help treat people. The good bacteria helped people feel better faster and got rid of the fungus quicker. It also helped people not get sick again after one month. But, this did not make people feel better in the long run or completely get rid of the fungus. Using good bacteria did not cause more serious problems. We need more studies with better methods, longer time, and more people to know if using good bacteria with antif
We looked at seven studies with 696 people from different countries and money levels. These studies help us understand how a medicine called progestogens works for women who might have a miscarriage. The studies showed that progestogens can help lower the chance of a miscarriage when taken by mouth, but might not work as well when used in a different way. The medicine might not help with early births, and we are not sure if it affects babies with health problems. We need more information to be sure.
We looked at many tests about using lasers to treat a type of eye problem called diabetic retinopathy. We found 83 tests, but only 5 were good enough to use in our study. These 5 tests had 4786 people in them. Most of the people had a more serious type of diabetic retinopathy. The tests used different types of lasers and compared them to no treatment or waiting to treat. After 12 months, there wasn't a big difference between the people who got the laser treatment and those who didn't. But, the laser treatment did help slow down the eye problem and reduce the risk of more
We looked at two studies with 269 people. Most of them were men (67%) and around 65 years old. The studies were done in China and Italy. They included adults who had trouble breathing after stomach surgery. We think both studies might have some problems. Using special breathing machines (CPAP or NPPV) might help people need fewer tubes in their throat. This could help 1 out of 11 people. There is not very strong proof that these machines can also help people spend less time in the ICU (about 2 days less). We didn't find any differences in how many people died or how long they
We looked at four studies with 388 women who needed help with pain during childbirth. The studies tested different ways to help with pain, so we couldn't compare them easily. Three studies tested a medicine called diazepam against other medicines for pain relief. One study tested two different ways to give pain relief in the lower body. In one small study, women who got diazepam felt better pain relief than those who got another medicine. In another small study, there was no big difference between diazepam and another medicine. In the study with lower body pain relief, women who got one type felt better pain relief and less severe pain
We looked at 15 studies with 1,048 people. Most of these studies were done in India, Europe, and the United States. The people in the studies were adults with mild to moderate asthma. Some studies looked at yoga breathing only, while others looked at yoga with breathing, posture, and meditation. The studies lasted from two weeks to 54 months. There was some evidence that yoga may help improve life quality, asthma symptoms, and reduce medicine use. However, we are not sure if yoga helps with lung function. No serious problems happened because of yoga, but we need more information. We think yoga might help people with
The review looked at 10 tests with 249 people trying different treatments. Seven tests looked at one treatment, and three tests looked at two treatments together. Many tests did not give enough information about how well the treatments worked. Two tests with 58 people showed no big difference in muscle strength after six months. One test with 44 people showed that a treatment called methotrexate did not stop or slow down the disease. None of the tests were big enough to show if the treatments really worked. Six tests had very low-quality information about the main goal. Three tests with 78 people compared a treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin
In this update, we looked at nine studies with 3,144 people. We found that a medicine called linezolid worked better than another medicine called vancomycin for treating skin infections, including those caused by a tough germ called MRSA. People taking linezolid had fewer side effects like red skin, itching, and rashes, but more people had low platelets and felt sick. People taking linezolid also spent less time in the hospital and had lower costs for their treatment. However, the studies we looked at might be biased because they were supported by the company that makes linezolid. We need more studies
We looked at eight studies with 512 people in total. These studies were very different from each other in how they were done and what they measured. We found that there were no big differences in how many people died after surgery, how long they lived, or how sick they got, except for one problem with stomach emptying that was better in one group. We also found that one type of surgery took less time, had less blood loss, and needed fewer blood transfusions. But, the information we have is not very strong. Right now, we can't say for sure which surgery is better. We need more good studies to help
We looked at six studies with 1862 people. These studies tested if a certain medicine helps people who have a bad head injury. The medicine might help some people, but it might also hurt others. We need more information to know for sure.
We looked at four studies with 3090 people in them. Three of the studies were good, and one was not as good. We compared two groups: one that got CPR first and then a special heart shock, and another that got the heart shock right away. We found that about the same number of people in both groups left the hospital alive and with good brain health. We also couldn't tell if one treatment was better than the other for helping the heart start beating again or for people living after one year. There were no bad side effects from either treatment. We still don't know for sure which treatment is better, so we
We looked at 15 tests to find the best way to help women with a problem in having babies. We found 10 tests that we could use. Only one test talked about how many babies were born. We learned that some methods used more medicine and had more problems than others. But, we still don't know the best way to help these women. We need more good tests to find the best answer.
This update from 2009-10 includes 53 studies about family help for people with a mental health problem called schizophrenia. Family help might make it less likely for the person to get worse, go to the hospital, or take their medicine. But, it doesn't seem to change if they stop getting care. Family help also seems to make it easier for the person to be social and for the family to get along better. We don't know if family help can stop or cause someone to think about ending their life. Family help might be good for people with schizophrenia, doctors, and people who make decisions about health care. But,
Three tests with 263 people were done to see if a special balloon with medicine could help fix blocked blood vessels in the leg. These tests were done in Germany and Austria. The balloons were made by two companies. The tests looked at how well the treatment worked and if it made people feel better. The results were not very sure because the tests were different and there were not many people in them. Most people were checked for up to 12 months, but one test checked for up to 24 months. The results showed that the special balloons worked better than regular balloons for fixing the blood vessels and making people feel better for up to
This text talks about a study with 922 people in 7 different tests. The study looked at how a medicine called corticosteroids helped people with a sickness called Kawasaki disease. The medicine helped make some problems in the heart better, made people feel better faster, and made their hospital stay shorter. The study also found that some groups of people might get more help from the medicine than others, but more tests are needed to know for sure. The study suggests that giving this medicine to all kids with Kawasaki disease might be a good idea until more tests are done.
We looked at eight studies with 846 people. These studies compared different ways to help parents and their babies. Some of the parents had depression or other problems. We wanted to see if one method, called PIP, was better than others. We found that PIP did not make a big difference in helping parents with depression. But, it did help some babies feel more secure with their parents. PIP was not better than other ways of helping parents and babies. We need more research to know if PIP is really helpful. We also need to study other things that might affect how parents and babies get along.
We added one more study to our research, making a total of 11 studies with 753 people. The results were not very clear, but they showed that giving extra oxygen to healthy moms during a special kind of surgery called a caesarean section might not help or hurt the mom or baby. We need to be careful with these results because the studies were not very strong.
We looked at 12 studies with 2196 people. Four of these studies were new in 2011. In six groups from four studies, we checked how many pills people took. Reminder packaging helped people take more pills (about 11% more). But, these studies were very different from each other. Two studies asked people if they took their pills. The reminder packaging did not make a big difference. We also looked at two studies that checked blood pressure. Reminder packaging helped lower one type of blood pressure, but not the other type. We looked at two more studies about blood sugar. Reminder packaging helped lower blood sugar levels,
We looked at 15 tests that studied 11 different medicines to see how they work. All the tests had some problems. There were no big differences in how well people did after taking the medicines. One medicine, trimetazidine, helped people leave the hospital faster. Some medicines helped the liver work better and protected it from damage. But, we need more tests with more people to be sure. Right now, we should only use these medicines in special tests before giving them to everyone.
We looked at 61 studies about kidney problems in people who had cancer treatment. These studies had different results, with some people having no kidney problems and others having a lot. This might be because the studies looked at different types of cancer, treatments, and ways to measure kidney problems. Some studies found that certain treatments, like certain medicines and radiation, can cause kidney problems. But, not all studies agreed. We also found that people who had cancer treatment might have high blood pressure, and being overweight can increase this risk. Because the studies were so different, we couldn't combine their results. We need more research to understand how often kidney
Two tests with 182 people tried two plant-based medicines called Niprisan® (or Nicosan®) and Ciklavit®. The main test showed that Niprisan® helped lessen very painful sickle cell disease problems for six months (not very strong proof). It didn't change the risk of serious problems or low red blood cell count (not very strong proof). No bad side effects were found. One test of Ciklavit® showed it might help people with painful problems (not very strong proof) but might have a bad effect on red blood cell count (not very strong proof). Nip
We looked at 308 articles and chose three studies with 1,999 people. We found that the studies were not perfect, but they were okay. The studies tested two different treatments for a type of cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). One treatment used only medicine (chemotherapy), and the other treatment used medicine and a special kind of energy (radiotherapy). The studies checked if a special picture called a PET scan could help decide which treatment is better. They found that people who had only medicine (chemotherapy) did not do as well as those who had both medicine and energy (radiotherapy). But, we still
We looked at 31 tests about birth control methods. Some tests compared different types of birth control pills, while others looked at shots, a ring, and implants. We found that there were not many big differences in how these methods affected sugar levels in the body for women without diabetes. However, we can't be sure because there were not many tests comparing the same types of birth control. Also, many tests had a small number of people and some people didn't finish the tests. We still don't know much about how these methods affect women who might have problems with their sugar levels because of their weight. Most tests only included women of
We looked at 10 studies about exercise and hip pain. Seven of these studies were good and had a low chance of being wrong. The studies showed that exercise can help reduce pain and make it easier to move. However, the studies were not perfect, and some things might not be completely accurate. One of the studies did not give enough information, so we could not be sure if it was good or not. Nine of the studies had 549 people in them, and they showed that exercise helped with pain and movement right after the exercise was done. Exercise made pain go down by 8 points and movement go up by 7 points
Nine good studies with 260 people were looked at. Six studies compared exercise therapy to no exercise, and three compared two different exercise therapies. The results showed that exercise therapy is helpful for muscle strength, exercise ability, and moving around. It also helps improve mood a little bit. However, exercise therapy didn't help with tiredness or how people felt about their disability. There was no proof that one exercise program was better than another, and no bad effects from exercise therapy were found. This review shows that exercise therapy can be good for people with MS who are not having a flare-up. There is a need for more agreement on how to
In a study with 75 people, they were split into two groups. One group had a surgery called laparoscopic cholecystectomy right away (within 24 hours), and the other group had the same surgery after waiting for about 4 months. The study wanted to see if there were any differences between the two groups. There were no serious problems during the surgery for either group. However, during the waiting period, the group that waited for the surgery had some health issues. In total, 14 people in the waiting group had to go to the hospital because of these problems. The study found that the group who had the
We looked at 11 tests in this review. Some of the tests were not very clear, so we had to be careful with the results. Seven of these tests helped us understand the main question. We found that taking antibiotics for a long time can help lower the chance of getting an infection after surgery. We are not sure if taking antibiotics for a short time is better than just taking one dose. We didn't find any bad side effects from the medicines in these tests. We also couldn't tell if one type of antibiotic is better than another. For people having jaw surgery, taking antibiotics for a long time can help lower the chance of
We looked at one study with 40 babies and 42 women. The study was too small to find important differences between two choices. There were no big good or bad effects of choosing to have a baby early at 36 weeks when the baby has a belly problem called gastroschisis. The main things we looked at were if the mom needed a special kind of birth called a caesarean section and if the baby lived until it was time to leave the hospital. Two babies in the early birth group passed away before leaving the hospital, but none in the other group. Some moms in both groups had caesarean sections
Three studies with adults were done to see if paracetamol helps with pain when added to strong pain medicine. There were 122 people in the studies at first, but only 95 finished. No studies were done with kids. The studies had some problems, so we can't be sure if the results are right. They didn't find that paracetamol made a big difference in pain, how people felt, or if they needed more medicine. We don't know if paracetamol is good or bad for treating cancer pain when used with other pain medicine.
We looked at 15 tests, and most of them were done in China and in hospitals. The information from these tests was not very good, and some of it was missing or not useful. We can't be sure about the results because there might be mistakes. The tests mostly looked at how big the wet spot on a pillow was. They tried different medicines to see which one worked best. Two medicines worked better than a fake medicine, but one of them could be harmful. Another medicine also worked well, but the information was not clear. Some other treatments, like rice oil and a Chinese medicine, also seemed to work well. But
We looked at six studies with 195 people who have MS. These studies tested different breathing exercises to help their muscles. Some people stopped doing the exercises, but there were no serious problems. We combined the results of five studies to see if the exercises helped. We found that one type of breathing exercise helped a little, but the other type did not. The studies did not tell us if these exercises made people feel better overall. We need more studies to know if these exercises really help and if they are safe.
A study looked at 38 women (41 pregnancies) to see if a medicine called betamethasone helped with a problem called ITP during pregnancy. They compared the medicine to no medicine and found no big difference in two problems for babies: low platelets and bleeding. The study didn't look at other problems like the mother's death, baby's death, or bleeding after birth. Right now, there isn't enough proof to say betamethasone helps with ITP during pregnancy. More studies are needed to know if it works and if it's safe. Until then, doctors shouldn't use it for ITP in
We looked at two studies with 111 people who had a problem with their eyes called keratoconus. The studies were done in Iran. The people were given one of two surgeries: DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. Only one eye was treated in each person. The smaller study checked on the people for 12 months. In the bigger study, four DALK surgeries didn't work, and they didn't measure how well the people could see. The other 77 people were checked for 3 months to over 3 years after their stitches were removed. We couldn't find out how they chose which surgery for the smaller
We looked at many studies about women taking iron supplements. We found that women who took iron had less chance of being low in iron and had higher levels of iron in their blood. This helped them feel less tired and do better in physical activities. However, some women had stomach problems like diarrhea, constipation, and stomach pain when taking iron. We are not sure if iron helps women think better because the studies had different results. Overall, taking iron every day can help women have more iron in their bodies and feel less tired, but it might cause some stomach issues.
We looked at five studies with 1,726 patients. We found one more study, but it's not finished yet. In the five studies, using two medicines together did not help people live longer. But, it did help slow down the sickness for some people. The information we have is not very strong because some details are missing. Using two medicines together can cause more side effects like diarrhea and hair loss, but less serious problems with white blood cells. Both using one medicine or two medicines can be good choices for treating patients with a serious sickness. We need more studies to know if using two medicines together is really better.
Because of different ways to test and measure, and different people in the study, it was hard to put some results together. Even with these problems, the study showed that a sideways cut during surgery affects breathing less, especially right after the operation, and is less likely to break open. The information about pain is not very clear, but some results show that a sideways cut might hurt less. There was no difference in other problems after surgery or how long it took to recover. However, a sideways cut might look better. Using a sideways cut might need less pain medicine and have fewer breathing problems, but this was not very important because the rates
We looked at nine studies with 981 people about back pain treatments. These studies were done in Europe and North America. The people in the studies were between 32 and 43 years old. The studies had some problems, so we need to be careful with the results. We found that a treatment called MBR helped people feel less pain and have less trouble doing things. It also helped them go back to work and take fewer sick days. But when we compared MBR to other treatments, we didn't see a big difference in pain, how well people could do things, or time away from work. No studies talked about people going
We looked at 18 studies with 4843 people to see how bisphosphonates, a type of medicine, work for people with bone pain from prostate cancer. We found that bisphosphonates might not make a big difference in pain relief. However, they may help reduce bone problems and slow down the cancer. But, they can also cause more kidney problems and nausea. We need more research to understand how bisphosphonates affect a person's quality of life and pain.
We looked at 3046 articles and found five important studies with 1093 patients. These studies tested a special treatment for a type of cancer called FL. The studies were not perfect, but they were good enough to learn from. The treatment helped patients with FL who had not been treated before. It made their cancer get better for a longer time. But, it did not help them live longer. One study also tested the treatment with another medicine called rituximab, and it showed the same results. The treatment did not cause more serious problems or other types of cancer. But, it did cause more side effects like infections and
We looked at 15 studies (1437 people) about WDD for schizophrenia. Some parts of the studies had problems, but overall, they were okay. The data showed that WDD helped people feel better in the short-term compared to no treatment. When WDD was compared to other medicines, like chlorpromazine or risperidone, there was no difference in how people felt. But, WDD had fewer side effects. When WDD was added to other medicines, people felt better and had fewer side effects. However, the evidence is not very strong. We need more and better studies to know if WDD really helps
In this update, researchers looked at 12 studies with 799 people to compare different types of arch wires used in braces. They wanted to see if there were differences in how fast teeth moved, how much pain people felt, and if there were any problems with the wires. They found that one type of wire, called coaxial superelastic NiTi, might help teeth move faster over 12 weeks. They also found that there might not be a big difference in pain between two other types of wires, multistrand stainless steel and superelastic NiTi. However, they didn't have enough information to say for sure if one type of
This is a study about 306 older people with memory problems who lived in 16 nursing homes in France. The study looked at how their behavior changed using three different ways to measure it. The study found that some behaviors improved in the group that received help, but there was no difference in other behaviors. The study's results are not very strong because of some issues with how it was done. There were no differences in two other ways of measuring behavior. There is another study being done, but right now, we don't know for sure if helping people with their behavior works well or which ways are best. We need more good research to
We looked at 13 studies with 1316 people who had trouble controlling their pee or poop. These people lived in nursing homes or were in the hospital. Most of the studies were small and didn't last very long. The studies had some problems, so we couldn't combine their results. The studies tested different skin care products and ways to take care of the skin. Two studies showed that using soap and water wasn't very good at preventing and treating skin problems. Instead, using a special skin cleanser or a washcloth with special properties worked better. Other studies suggested that using a product that stays on the skin, like a moistur
We looked at seven studies with 333 people to see if certain medicines help with a sickness called IM. The studies were done in different places and with people of different ages. The medicines used were acyclovir, valomaciclovir, and valacyclovir. The studies checked on the patients for 20 days to six months. The results of the studies were not very clear, so we need to be careful when looking at them. Two out of 12 things we looked at showed some improvement with the medicine, but it might not be very important. One thing that improved was that people felt better five days sooner,
This study looked at four tests with 2250 people. They were given either insulin detemir or insulin glargine to help control their blood sugar. Insulin glargine was given once a day at night, while insulin detemir was given once or twice a day. The study found that both insulins worked similarly in controlling blood sugar levels and did not have many differences in side effects. Insulin detemir caused less weight gain, but insulin glargine had fewer reactions at the injection site. The study could not decide which insulin was better for quality of life, cost, or long-term health.
This text talks about some studies that looked at a treatment called SNS for people who have trouble controlling their bowel movements (called FI) or have constipation. The studies found that SNS helped some people with FI have fewer accidents, but it didn't help people with constipation. Some people had problems or side effects from the treatment, like pain or infections. The text says we need more good studies to know for sure how well SNS works for these problems.
Two tests were done to see if molar bands or molar tubes work better for teeth. The tests showed that molar bands are better because they don't fail as much. Molar bands also help keep teeth healthier. More tests are needed to be sure, but right now, molar bands seem to be the better choice.
We looked at 66 articles about a test for stomach cancer. The test helps doctors know how bad the cancer is. We found that the test is helpful, but not perfect. It is better at finding some types of cancer than others. We need to learn more about why the test works better for some people and not others.
We looked at six studies with 492 people who had two types of surgeries for gallstones. One type let them go home the same day, and the other type made them stay overnight in the hospital. The studies had different numbers of people, ages, and women. Only one study talked about if anyone died soon after surgery, but no one did. We think no one died in the other studies too. No study talked about if anyone died a long time after surgery. We found that both types of surgeries were safe and had similar results. People had the same amount of pain, time to feel better, and time to go back to
We looked at eight studies with 2488 people, which is more than before. These studies were mostly good quality. They tested a strong pain-relief cream called capsaicin on people with different types of pain. Some people got a weaker cream to compare the results. For one type of pain called postherpetic neuralgia, the strong cream helped about 10% more people feel much better after 8 and 12 weeks. For another type of pain called HIV-neuropathy, the strong cream also helped about 10% more people feel better after 12 weeks. For a third type of pain called diabetic
We looked at three studies with 6343 people. These studies were about a health problem called carotid stenosis, which is when a blood vessel in the neck gets narrow. This can cause a stroke, which is when blood can't flow to the brain properly. We combined the information from all three studies to make sure we were comparing the same things. We found that surgery helped people with different levels of carotid stenosis. For people with a little bit of narrowing (less than 30%), surgery increased the chance of having a stroke. For people with a medium amount of narrowing (30% to 49
In a study, they looked at different ways to do a surgery called enterostomy. This surgery is done for different reasons like rectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, and more. They wanted to see which way was better to prevent problems like parastomal herniation and skin irritation. They looked at one main study and ten smaller studies with many people in them. The results were not clear, and they could not say which way was better. They also looked at other problems related to the surgery, but they did not find enough information. In the end, they still don't know the best way to do this surgery.
After looking at 24 studies with 2126 people, we found that supportive therapy and standard care had similar results for helping people with mental health issues. However, other treatments like talking to a psychologist or learning about mental health seemed to work better than supportive therapy in some cases. These results are not very strong because the studies were not very good. We need more research to know for sure which treatment is best.
Eleven studies were looked at, with 949 people who had mostly bad pain. The studies tested different pain medicines called NSAIDs. Some studies also tested NSAIDs with other pain medicines called opioids. The studies had some problems, so it was hard to know if the results were good or not. The studies didn't show how many people felt a lot better or a little better from their pain. In four studies, people's pain got better after one or two weeks. Some people had side effects like dry mouth, loss of appetite, sleepiness, and stomach problems. Some people stopped taking the medicines because they didn't work or because
Two studies with 287 people were done. One study had 253 people and found that a medicine called tinzaparin helped reduce pain faster than a fake medicine (placebo). People who took tinzaparin also spent fewer days in the hospital. There were two small bleeding problems in the tinzaparin group, but none in the placebo group. The second study had 34 people and found that another medicine, dalteparin, helped reduce pain more than the placebo after one day. The information from these studies is not enough to say if these medicines really help people with sickle cell disease. More studies need to be done to
We did not find any finished tests that were random. We looked at 36 studies with 1285 patients and compared two types of medicines, but there was no big difference in the chances of death or a certain type of stroke. When we checked if people got better or not, there was a small trend that one medicine might be better, but it was not a big difference. Some side effects happened only in one group, but there was no big difference between the two medicines. We did not find any tests that compared these medicines to no medicine, so we don't know if they should be used for a certain health problem. We
We looked at 26 studies with 2066 patients. Because the treatments and results were different, we couldn't combine them. We grouped the results by wound type and silver treatment. For burns, 13 studies compared silver treatments to non-silver ones. One study showed fewer infections with silver nitrate, but three studies showed more infections with a silver cream. Six studies compared the silver cream to silver dressings. One study showed fewer infections with a silver dressing, but the other five found no difference. One study compared two silver dressings and found less infection with silver-coated gauze. For other wounds, six studies
We looked at 12 studies with 3,571 people. These studies tested different medicines to treat a lung problem called VAP in adults. Some studies might be a little biased because they didn't share all the results or had connections to drug companies. We found that using one medicine or a mix of medicines didn't make a big difference in how many people got better or how long they stayed in the hospital. We also didn't find a big difference in side effects. But, we did find that one type of medicine called carbapenems might help people get better more than other medicines. Our study helps show that using just one
We looked at 29 studies about rules for 11 types of medicines. These rules were for older people or people with low money who get help to pay for their medicines. The results were different for each type of medicine and if the rules were made stricter or easier. When rules were about stomach-acid and pain-relief medicines, people used less of them and saved money right away and for up to two years. They didn't need more help from other health services (6 studies). When rules were about a certain kind of mental health medicine, people stopped their treatment more often and used other health services without saving money (2 studies).
We looked at 19 studies with 4232 people to see if one-to-one oral health advice (OHA) helps keep teeth and gums healthy. The studies were different, so we couldn't combine their results. We put similar studies into groups to compare them. Group 1: One-to-one OHA vs. no OHA Four studies looked at this. Two studies showed that OHA might help with gum health and less plaque on teeth, but the evidence was not strong. Two other studies looked at tooth decay and found weak evidence that OHA might help after 12 months. Group 2: Personalized OHA
Five small tests were done with different groups of people to see if certain treatments helped with shoulder pain. The treatments included taking medicine by mouth, getting shots in the shoulder, or moving the shoulder while asleep. The tests were not all the same and some were not very good. One test showed that taking medicine by mouth helped people feel better and move their shoulder more easily for a short time, but it didn't last after 6 weeks. Another test showed that the medicine helped people feel better faster, but there was no big difference in the end. A third test showed that taking medicine by mouth helped with pain at first, but not much
We looked at three studies with 50 people in total. These studies compared rTMS, a treatment, with a fake treatment. The studies were not done very well and had some problems. We could not combine the results because they were too different. Also, many people did not finish the studies, which made the results less trustworthy. The studies did not give us enough information about how well rTMS worked after six months. Only one study had information we could use to see how well rTMS worked after 12 months. This study showed that rTMS did not work better than the fake treatment. No bad things happened
We looked at 10 studies with 1049 people to learn about different treatments for a skin problem. Some treatments worked better than others, but we still need to learn more. Using creams with strong medicine can help, but sometimes they can cause side effects. Using creams with less strong medicine can also work well and be safer. We need to study more about combining different treatments to find the best way to help people with this skin problem.
In a study with 7957 people with stomach problems, 75 tests were done using different herbal medicines. Some tests had high quality, but most were not very good. The tests compared herbal medicines to regular medicines and placebos (fake medicines). Some herbal medicines helped people feel better, but others did not. When combined with regular medicines, some herbal medicines worked even better. No one had serious problems from using the herbal medicines. However, we should be careful with the results because some tests were not very good. More good-quality tests should be done to learn more about these herbal medicines.
We looked at 22 tests about using special medicine to stop pregnancy. These tests had 12,400 people from Europe, Asia, and the Americas. They studied different types and amounts of the medicine. The results showed that one medicine called levonorgestrel (LNG) worked well and was safe. Some other medicines seemed good, but they need more study. The most common problem was changes in periods, but other side effects were mild. Most women liked this method even with the period changes. The tests had some problems and were old, but we think the results are still helpful because there were many people in the tests and
In this update, 14 new studies were added, making a total of 15 studies with 561 patients. These studies happened in Europe, India, China, South Korea, and the USA. Most patients were teenagers or young adults, but two studies had people aged 12 to 54. There were similar numbers of boys and girls in eight studies, but more girls in seven studies. The studies looked at two ways to help teeth move: surgical anchorage and conventional anchorage. They found that surgical anchorage worked better by 1.68 mm, but we should be careful with this result because the studies were different. There
We looked at 50 studies with 45,285 people. Most of these studies compared a medicine called statins to a fake pill or no treatment for adults with kidney problems who were not on a machine to help their kidneys. We found that statins helped prevent heart problems and death in these people. However, we are not sure if statins help with strokes or if they cause any bad side effects. Overall, statins are important for helping people with kidney problems avoid heart issues and live longer.
We looked at many articles and found nine studies with 379 people. These people had two different health problems: cerebral palsy (CP) and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). They were between 2 and 19 years old. Most of the studies were a certain type of experiment called RCTs. In the CP studies, they tested two different treatments. In the OI studies, they tested a medicine called bisphosphonates. They didn't test any common pain medicines. Pain was not the main thing they were studying in most of the studies. The studies had different levels of quality. Only one study had more than
We looked at seven tests with 1697 people. Six tests were used for counting and comparing results. One test did not have any information. We checked how well a medicine called latrepirdine worked and if it was safe for people with memory problems. Some tests had problems that made the results not very good. We found that latrepirdine might help a little with how doctors see changes in patients after 26 weeks. But, we could not tell if it helped with thinking skills or daily activities. The results were not very good. However, it did show a small help with behavior problems. The medicine did not cause more
We looked at seven studies with 735 people to see how RIC helps with a type of stroke called ischaemic stroke. We checked if the studies were good and found some problems, but we still used them to learn more. We found that RIC can help lower the chance of having another stroke for people with a specific problem in their brain blood vessels. It also helps make the stroke less severe for people getting a treatment called carotid stenting. But, RIC might make things worse for people getting a different treatment called intravenous thrombolysis. We are not completely sure about these results because there are not many studies
We looked at six studies with 204 early-born babies. The studies showed that adding protein to human milk helped the babies grow faster in weight, length, and head size while they were in the hospital. But, it did not make a big difference in how thick their skin was. Adding protein also made the babies stay in the hospital longer and have higher levels of a certain thing in their blood. We could not tell if adding protein caused any problems with feeding or a serious stomach issue. We also did not know if it changed the levels of a certain thing in their blood. There was no information about how the babies grew after they left
This text talks about a review of 45 studies that looked at how helpful PEMs (special papers with information) are for doctors. Most of the studies (44 out of 45) compared using PEMs to not using anything. One study compared a paper PEM to the same information on a CD-ROM. The results showed that when doctors used PEMs, they did a little better in their work compared to when they didn't use anything. But, there isn't enough information to know if PEMs help patients or if they are better than other ways of learning. It's also not clear if PEMs work better when used with other
We looked at 5,271 articles and chose 23 to study. Most of these studies were done in the USA at health clinics. They taught people about safe sex and how to avoid getting sick from it. Some also gave free health services. The studies were different in many ways, like how long they lasted and what they tried to teach. They talked about different sicknesses you can get from sex, like HIV and chlamydia, but not HPV or cervical cancer. Some studies showed that teaching people about safe sex helped them use condoms more, but it didn't always work. It didn't help people have less sex or
We looked at 20 studies with 2337 people in total. These studies checked if short lessons about mental health helped people more than regular care or other treatments. We found that people who got these short lessons were more likely to take their medicine and had fewer mental health problems in the short and medium term. They also had better social skills. But, we didn't see a big difference in their overall happiness or how long they lived. We need more big, good-quality studies to know if these short lessons really work well.
We looked at 11 studies with 9,839 people in them. Most of these studies were about people with bad lung problems (COPD) but not very recent ones. One big study had people with recent lung problems and was 37% of all the people in the studies. Most of the studies were paid for by medicine companies, so we think they might be a little biased. One study that wasn't paid for by a medicine company also had some problems. The studies looked at different groups of people with lung problems and checked on them for 6 to 52 weeks. They compared two different treatments for lung problems (
We looked at 3 studies with 91 kids aged 6 months to 4 years. These studies were done in the USA and Spain. They tested a gas called heliox to help kids with a sickness called croup. The studies had different results, so we are not sure if heliox works well or not. We need more studies to know if heliox is good for treating croup in kids.
This text talks about a review of eight studies about different levels of medical care. The studies had some problems and did not give very clear information. They looked at how often people had broken bones in their back when they went to the doctor for back pain. The studies found that some warning signs might help doctors find these broken bones, but they are not always accurate. When doctors used a combination of warning signs, they did a better job at finding the broken bones. However, using these warning signs can also lead to mistakes and extra costs for patients. More research is needed to find the best way to use these warning signs and to report the
Two tests were done to study treatments for a problem called urethral stricture in men. The first test compared two treatments in 210 men, but there was no big difference in results after three years. The second test compared two treatments in 50 men who had an injury. In the first six months, more men needed extra surgery in one treatment group than the other. After two years, more men in the first group still needed help compared to the second group. There isn't enough information to know which treatment is the best. More tests need to be done to find the best way to help men with this problem.
We looked at six tests to see how well two different asthma treatments worked. These tests included kids and adults with asthma. We found that both treatments helped with asthma, but one treatment worked a little better in some ways. The better treatment helped people breathe easier, have fewer asthma symptoms, and use less rescue medicine. However, the other treatment might be better for kids because it didn't slow down their growth as much. Both treatments were safe, but we still need to learn more about how they work in the long run. Doctors should think about the good and bad parts of each treatment when deciding what is best for their patients.
We looked at 17 studies with 1639 people who have kidney problems. These studies tested different diets and how they affect people's health. Some diets helped people feel better and improved their kidney function. They also helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. However, we are not sure if these diets can help people live longer or avoid serious heart problems. We need more research to find out the best diets for people with kidney problems.
One study looked at 156 young kids with a breathing problem called bronchiolitis. They were put into three groups: one got a special medicine, one got a saltwater treatment, and one got mist in a tent. The medicine group got better, but the other two groups didn't show much improvement. The study didn't talk about any bad side effects. People often use steam or cool mist to help with bronchiolitis, especially when they don't have a lot of resources. The study showed that the medicine worked well, but the mist in a tent didn't help much. Since only one study was looked at,
We looked at four studies with 1,154 people aged 50 to 90 years old. All of them had a type of memory problem called Alzheimer's Disease. They were taking a medicine to help with their memory. We wanted to see if another medicine called statins would help them too. We checked their memory using two tests. After looking at all the studies, we found that statins did not help improve their memory. We also checked if statins caused any bad side effects, but there was no big difference between people taking statins and those not taking them. We did not find any studies about statins helping with another
This text talks about four studies with 149 people. Two studies looked at using night splints for 26 people with a disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A. They found no big differences between wearing a night splint and not wearing one. Another study looked at a medicine called prednisone for 103 boys with a disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The medicine helped with some strength and function, but not with ankle movement. A higher dose of the medicine didn't help either. Another study looked at surgery for 20 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The surgery helped with ankle movement after
This text talks about a study that looked at how different positions during labor can affect the time it takes and the health of the mother and baby. The study found that when women stand or walk during the first part of labor, it can be shorter and they may need fewer medical treatments. This did not cause any harm to the mothers or babies. However, more research is needed to be sure of these results. Based on what we know now, it is a good idea for women with low-risk pregnancies to be told about the benefits of standing or walking during labor and to choose the position they feel most comfortable in.
This text talks about a study that looked at a health problem called TOS. The study was hard to do because there isn't a clear way to know if someone has TOS. They looked at a few different ways to treat TOS and found some things that might help with the pain. They also found that some treatments didn't work much better than just using a pretend treatment. The people doing the study think there needs to be a better way to know if someone has TOS and more research to find the best way to help people with this problem.
We looked at 21 tests with 884 people. Wearing a hand brace helped people feel better and use their hands more easily after four weeks. Using sound waves (ultrasound) for two weeks didn't help much, but using it for seven weeks did help. Taking medicine by mouth, like steroids, helped people feel better after two and four weeks, but other medicines didn't help. Taking vitamin B6 didn't help either. Doing yoga helped reduce pain after eight weeks. Moving the small bones in the wrist helped people feel better after three weeks. For people with diabetes, getting steroid and insulin shots helped them feel better after eight
We looked at two studies with 708 people who had eye problems called CRVO-ME. One study compared a medicine called triamcinolone with just watching the problem (165 people got the medicine and 72 people were watched). The other study compared a medicine called dexamethasone with fake treatments (290 people got the medicine and 147 people got the fake treatment). We found some problems with the studies, like missing information and not reporting everything. Some people didn't finish the studies, especially in the group that was just watched. The second study had people with different eye problems, but they didn't show the
Six studies with 394 patients were looked at. Five of these studies showed that using a nose spray with special medicine helped make breathing easier and made the adenoids smaller. The first study showed that using beclomethasone spray worked better than a fake spray. The second study showed that using beclomethasone spray helped 38% of patients breathe better. The third study showed that using mometasone spray for 40 days helped 77.7% of patients avoid surgery. The fourth study showed that using flunisolide spray for eight weeks made adenoids smaller. The fifth study showed that using flut
We looked at one small study with 24 women in Mexico. The study tested two groups of women. One group got regular treatments for high blood pressure and other problems during pregnancy. The other group got a special treatment called an epidural block, along with some of the regular treatments. The study wanted to see if the epidural block helped the moms and babies. But, the study didn't give us enough information to know if it worked or not. We need more big and well-done studies to find out if epidural blocks are good for moms and babies with high blood pressure during pregnancy. We also need to learn how long the epid
We looked at 16 tests to see if a medicine called glucocorticosteroids helps people with liver problems caused by alcohol. The tests included 927 people who got the medicine and 934 people who did not. The people in the tests were between 25 and 70 years old, and most of them were men. We found that the medicine did not seem to help people live longer or feel better. It also did not seem to cause more serious problems or make liver problems worse. But, we are not sure about these results because the tests were not very good. We do not know if the companies that make the medicine paid
We looked at four studies with 245 people in total. The studies were different and had a few problems, so we couldn't combine them. They tested ways to help people drive better after having a stroke. Some used driving simulators and others focused on improving vision and motor skills. The people in the studies were mostly young and had strokes at different times. Main result: The studies didn't show clear improvement in driving skills right after training or six months later. But, one study with 73 people found that those who trained could recognize road signs better. One study showed that using a driving simulator might help, but we need more research
We looked at eight studies with 582 people to learn about the best way to treat a lung problem called COPD. The people in the studies were mostly older and had severe COPD. They were given a medicine called corticosteroids for different amounts of time. We found that giving the medicine for a short time (about 5 days) worked just as well as giving it for a longer time (10 to 14 days). Both ways helped people feel better and did not cause more problems. This means that a short treatment might be enough for adults with this lung problem. However, we need more research to be sure. Also
We looked at one study (13 people) and found three more studies that are still going on. These studies are about giving blood to people with a certain bone marrow problem called MDS. The information we have so far is not very good. The one study we looked at had two groups. One group got blood when their blood levels were lower (8 people), and the other group got blood when their blood levels were higher (5 people). We don't have enough information to know if one group did better than the other in terms of living longer or needing fewer blood transfusions. There were no problems related to low blood levels, and
We looked at 2079 articles and found 84 that might help us. We chose two studies about using games to teach health professionals. The first study used a game like "Family Feud" to teach about infection control. The people who played the game did better on a test (P = 0.02). The second study compared a "Snakes and Ladders" game to regular learning about preventing and treating strokes. There was no big difference in knowledge between the two groups right away or 3 months later. But the people who played the game had more fun. Our review doesn't prove if games are good or bad
We looked at eight tests with 475 people. Some people had one type of mood disorder, and others had a different kind. We checked if a medicine called lithium helped them feel better. It did help some people, but not everyone. We also looked at other things like how well they did in life, at work, and with friends. We didn't find big differences between lithium and other medicines. Lithium and other medicines can help some people with mood disorders, but we don't know which one is better. When picking a medicine, doctors and patients should think about the person's history, side effects, and if they will
Two tests with 130 patients were done to see if a medicine called amifostine helps protect salivary glands from damage caused by a strong treatment for thyroid cancer. The tests showed that amifostine did not make a big difference in protecting the glands, lowering blood pressure, or improving patients' quality of life. Two patients had problems after starting the medicine, but they got better. More tests are needed to find the best treatment for patients.
We looked at three studies with 45 kids between 2 and 6 years old who have Down syndrome. These studies tested if parents helping their kids with language and communication worked better than other methods. The studies were different and had some problems, so we couldn't combine their results. The studies had very few kids in them, so we can't be sure if the results would be the same for all kids with Down syndrome. The results from the studies were not the same. Two studies found no big differences in how well the kids could understand or speak. But, the kids who had help from their parents did learn some new words better
We looked at two studies from 1987 and 2004 with 148 people who had heart surgery. Both studies had some problems. We couldn't tell if exercise helped people live longer or have fewer bad health problems. The studies didn't talk about how people felt or other health results. We did find that exercise might help people be more active. We couldn't tell if exercise helped people go back to work after one year. We need more good studies to see if exercise helps people after heart surgery, including if they live longer and feel better.
We looked at five studies with 1130 people. Two studies were about meditation, and the others were about special care for very sick people that included help from a chaplain or spiritual counselor. The meditation studies didn't show a big difference in how good people felt. But when meditation was combined with massage, it helped people feel better. The other studies also didn't show a big difference in how good people felt. We don't know if these special care programs help people feel better or not. There needs to be more research on this topic. All five studies were done in the same country, and we don't know if everyone got
We looked at six tests with 137 people. We found two tests with 45 people that studied how tDCS affects Parkinson's disease. The results were not very clear, but there was some evidence that tDCS might help with movement problems. One test with 25 people looked at how tDCS affects the time when people have trouble moving, but there was no clear result. Two tests with 41 people looked at how fast people could walk, but there was no clear result. One test with 25 people looked at how tDCS affects people's health and happiness, but there was no clear result. We didn
We looked at four more studies in this update, making a total of 12 studies. The studies were not very good quality. Two small studies compared a pain treatment called LASB to a fake treatment and did not show it helped with pain. One small study compared two different pain treatments and found some difference in pain after one year, but not right away. Another study looked at LASB with other treatments and did not find extra help from LASB. Eight small studies compared different pain treatments and mostly found no difference in pain relief. One study compared two ways of doing LASB and found no big difference in pain relief. Six studies talked
We looked at 14 studies with 2488 people to learn about treatments for Bell's palsy, a condition that affects the face. We found that using both antiviral medicine and corticosteroids might not help people recover better than using just corticosteroids. Corticosteroids alone might work better than antiviral medicine alone. Using both antiviral medicine and corticosteroids might help people have fewer long-term problems from Bell's palsy compared to using just corticosteroids. We didn't find a clear difference in side effects from using antiviral medicine compared to corticosteroids or no
Two studies looked at different treatments for a type of cancer in women. They tested two medicines called leuprorelin and treosulfan, and another one called decapeptyl. The studies found that there might not be a big difference between using leuprorelin or treosulfan for helping people live longer or stopping the cancer from getting worse. Some side effects, like hair loss and tiredness, might be more common with treosulfan. The study with decapeptyl compared it to a fake treatment and found that the cancer took longer to get worse with decapeptyl. But, they didn't
We looked at 17 studies about babies who had trouble breathing because they didn't get enough oxygen. These studies tested a treatment called iNO. Some babies got iNO, and others got a fake treatment or regular care. The studies found that iNO helped about half of the babies breathe better. It also helped some babies avoid a more serious treatment called ECMO, but it didn't change how many babies lived or died. iNO didn't work as well for babies with a certain health problem called diaphragmatic hernia. Giving iNO earlier didn't make a big difference in how well the babies did. The treatment also didn
We looked at 15 studies about back supports. The studies were not very good. Only 5 of them were okay. We found out that back supports might not help prevent back pain. We also don't know if they help treat back pain. We need better studies to find out if back supports really work. In the future, we should pay attention to how people use the supports and what kind of supports they use.
We added a new study to our research, making a total of 57 studies. These studies looked at special tubes called catheters that help give medicine to patients. We found that treating catheters with special materials can help prevent infections in the blood and on the catheter. This was especially helpful in places called intensive care units (ICU). However, it did not make a big difference in other areas or in preventing other types of infections. We need to be careful about using these special catheters everywhere and do more research to see how they affect other important things like overall sickness and death rates.
This review looked at 15 studies about helping people in poor city areas in Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The studies focused on giving extra nutrients and teaching about healthy eating to pregnant women and children. The results were mixed and not very clear. Some studies showed that teaching pregnant women about nutrition helped their babies be born with a healthier weight. But, giving extra nutrients to children did not always help them grow taller or healthier. More research is needed to find the best ways to help people in these poor areas have better nutrition and health.
This text talks about a study that looked at 12 different tests with 1023 people. They wanted to see if foam bandages helped heal leg sores better than other types of bandages. They found that there was no big difference between the foam bandages and other kinds of bandages. The study also looked at if people had any problems with the different bandages, and they found no big differences there either. The study wasn't perfect, so more research is needed to know for sure if foam bandages are better for healing leg sores.
There were no tests done on some medicines to see if they were safe. Two tests were done on other medicines, but they were not combined because the patients and treatment times were different. The tests showed that the medicines did not make the patients' conditions worse, but the results were not very strong. Some patients had side effects, but they were not serious. The tests were not big enough or long enough to be sure about the results. Doctors need to be careful when giving these medicines to patients and more tests are needed to know if they are safe.
We looked at 22 studies about treating diabetic foot ulcers with over 2310 people. These studies tested different ways to treat the ulcers, like using special dressings or creams. We compared five different treatments to see which one worked best. 1) Using a special dressing might help more ulcers heal than using a regular dressing, but we are not sure (low certainty). 2) We don't know if using a special cream is better than using a regular cream (low certainty). 3) We can't tell which special cream works best because the studies were all different (very low certainty). 4) We don't know if
We looked at six studies with 5193 people. We found that taking zinc helped lower the chances of getting pneumonia by 13% and made it 41% less common. Zinc helped more when doctors used special tests to find pneumonia. Giving kids zinc can help lower their chances of getting pneumonia.
We looked at 10 studies with 33,179 people to see if vitamin A helps with lung infections. Most studies found that vitamin A didn't help. In some cases, it even made things worse. Vitamin A helped only in kids who didn't have enough food or were underweight. We don't know why this happens. So, we shouldn't give vitamin A to all kids to stop lung infections. It can help with other sicknesses like diarrhea, but only in kids who don't have enough food. A small amount of vitamin A is better than a big amount because it has fewer side effects.
We looked at 20 studies about a medicine called theophylline for people with breathing problems. The medicine was tested with different treatments. The results showed that theophylline helped people breathe better and improved their blood oxygen levels. However, it did not help them walk farther or feel less out of breath. Some people felt sick after taking theophylline, but they still liked it more than the fake medicine (placebo). Not many people stopped taking part in the studies. The results might not be the same for everyone because the people in the studies might have already been okay with taking theophylline.
We looked at 10 studies with 439 kids, aged 1 to 18 years old, who had egg allergies. The studies tried different ways to help the kids eat eggs without problems. Most kids (82%) who tried a special treatment could eat a small amount of egg, while only 10% of kids who didn't try the treatment could. About half (45%) of the kids who tried the treatment could eat a full serving of egg, compared to 10% who didn't try it. However, many kids had side effects from the treatment, like allergic reactions. Some kids even needed a special medicine called adrenaline.
We looked at four tests with 579 people. Only two tests talked about death, and they didn't find a difference between people who got a special heart monitor (ILR) and those who didn't. There was no information about short-term death. Two tests talked about problems after getting the ILR, but we couldn't compare them. Two tests showed no difference in how happy people were with their lives. Two tests showed fewer fainting episodes in people with ILRs. The ILR group had higher costs, but it was cheaper to find heart problems with ILRs. People with ILRs had more diagnoses (moderate quality evidence
We looked at four small studies about treating a health problem called hydroceles. These studies had 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. Some patients were treated with a method called aspiration and sclerotherapy, while others had surgery. We checked if the studies were fair and not biased. We found no big difference in how well the treatments worked, but one study was very different from the others. When we took that study out, surgery seemed to work better. Patients who had sclerotherapy had more hydroceles come back, but they had fewer problems like fever and infections. Surgery patients had more pain, but we couldn't
We looked at one study that compared a special medicine (rhDNase) to a fake medicine (placebo) in 40 kids with breathing problems and a cold. The study was good and not biased. The results showed no big difference between the two groups in how many kids stopped coughing after two weeks. But, the kids who took the fake medicine had less coughing at night. During the day, the fake medicine also seemed better, but the difference was not big enough to be sure. Other things like breathing trouble and lung tests were also a bit better with the fake medicine, but not by much. Right now, we
We looked at 21 studies with 2,658 people. All the studies tested different types of mental health therapy. We didn't find any studies about physical therapy. Most of the studies were about a therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The other studies looked at different types of therapy like mindfulness and behavior therapy. The studies compared the therapy to regular care or waiting for treatment. Some studies compared the therapy to better or more organized care. Only one study compared CBT to behavior therapy. The number of therapy sessions in the studies ranged from one to 13, and the time it took to finish the therapy was between one day
We looked at many studies to see if a special kind of pain relief called regional anesthesia can help stop long-lasting pain after surgery. We found some evidence that it might help after certain surgeries like chest surgery, breast cancer surgery, and C-sections. But, we need more and better studies to be sure. We also found that giving pain relief through an IV might help after breast cancer surgery. We can't say for sure if these pain relief methods work for other surgeries or types of anesthesia. There are more studies being done that might help us understand better in the future.
This text talks about a study with 28 tests and 1742 people. They tested different types of medicines to help people with a mental health problem called BPD. Some of the medicines were older, and some were newer. They also tested vitamins like omega-3 fatty acids. The study found that the newer medicines, called second-generation antipsychotics, and the vitamins might help people with BPD. But they need to do more tests to be sure. They also found that some medicines might cause side effects like weight gain or feeling sleepy. The study didn't find a big difference between using one medicine or two together. They
We looked at seven tests with 349 people, and 217 finished the studies. These tests tried to find out if cleaning the inside of a tube that helps people go to the bathroom is helpful or not. They used different cleaning liquids and methods. Some tests had problems, and the results were not very clear. We don't know if cleaning the tube is good or bad because we need more information. We need better tests to find out the best way to clean the tube and if it is helpful.
We looked at 30 studies with 18,682 people in them. These studies were about kids who had cancer and how tired they felt after their treatment. We found that the studies were very different from each other, so we couldn't put all the results together. Instead, we just described what we found. In 18 studies, the number of kids who felt very tired after cancer treatment was between 0% and 61.7%. In three studies with kids up to 18 years old, 6.7% to 12.5% felt very tired. In 12 studies with people 16 years and older
We looked at 36 tests with 6914 people. Different medicines and people were used in these tests. We found that using two types of medicines together helped lower sickness and the number of people who died. Using only one type of medicine helped lower sickness but not the number of people who died. Only one test checked if using these medicines could cause problems, and it didn't find any issues.
Five studies were looked at, and all of them were about teaching methods. Some studies also gave advice to nurses. Most of the studies were about people living in nursing homes, and one was about people living in group homes. No studies were about people living in their own homes. The studies were not very good quality and had different results. One study showed more people using physical restraints after eight months, while others showed less use after seven and 12 months. The study about group homes showed no change in restraint use after six months. There isn't enough proof to say that teaching nurses can help stop or lower the use of physical re
Four studies were looked at to see if a medicine called glucocorticoid helps women during a special baby-making process called IVF. Only two of the studies could be used, and the information was not very clear. There were not enough details to know if the medicine made a difference in having a baby or not. The studies also did not say if there were any side effects. More research is needed to know if this medicine is helpful and safe for women during IVF.
We looked at eight studies with 291 people aged 5 to 23 years old. These studies tested a medicine called rhGH. Most of the studies compared regular doses of rhGH to no treatment, and one study compared different doses. The studies lasted for six months to one year. We found that rhGH might help improve some lung functions, but there was no difference between regular and high doses. The medicine also helped people grow taller, gain weight, and increase muscle mass. However, it did not make a big difference in blood sugar levels or cause diabetes. There were some improvements in lung problems, but not many side effects.
We looked at 26 studies with 1,695 people to see how different ways of reducing contact with things that cause asthma at work can help. We compared three things: completely avoiding the cause, reducing contact with the cause, and not changing anything. To reduce contact, people could use safety equipment, improve air flow, change jobs, or learn more about the problem. We found that completely avoiding the cause might help people feel better and breathe easier compared to not changing anything. Reducing contact might also help people feel better, but it might not help them breathe easier. When we compared completely avoiding the cause to just reducing contact, there
This study looked at six different tests with 1,758 people. The people in the tests were between 48 and 57 years old, except for one test where the average age was 73. All of the people had stomach problems and were not in the hospital. The study looked at two ways to stop taking a certain medicine: slowly stopping or stopping all at once. The study found that slowly stopping the medicine might make people feel worse, but they would take fewer pills. People were also less happy with this method. The study did not look at how much money was saved or if there were any good effects from stopping the medicine
We looked at 13 studies with 975 people. These studies compared social skills programs to regular care or discussion groups. We found that social skills programs were better than regular care in helping people with their social skills. People in these programs also had fewer times when they got sick again or had to go back to the hospital. However, the information we have is not very strong. When we compared social skills programs to discussion groups, we didn't see a big difference in how people did. We still need more information to know if social skills programs can help people with schizophrenia in different places. Most of the studies we looked at were done in
One study looked at a medicine called pegloticase for people with a health problem called gout. The study had three groups: one group got pegloticase every two weeks, another group got it once a month, and the last group got a pretend medicine called a placebo. The study found that getting pegloticase every two weeks helped some people with gout, but it also caused some people to stop taking it because of bad side effects. Getting pegloticase once a month seemed to help less, but still caused side effects. Most of the side effects were because of gout getting worse, not the medicine
We looked at five studies about a medicine to help stop a sickness called NEC. Only three of the studies had the right information. We checked these three studies with 2095 babies. The medicine did not help lower the chances of getting NEC. The studies showed that the medicine did not help stop the sickness, the need for surgery, or death from NEC. So, we cannot say that this medicine helps prevent NEC. There are no studies about another medicine called IgA alone to stop NEC.
This text talks about a study that looked at different treatments for women after they had surgery and radiation for a health problem. The study found that adding a special kind of medicine called "chemotherapy" can help these women live longer and have a lower chance of the problem coming back. The medicine works even better when it is used together with radiation.
We looked at 35 studies from many countries. These studies were about different ways to help people with their health using phones and the internet. Some people liked these programs because they felt supported and could share the information with friends and family. But, some people had problems using these programs. They might not have a phone, good internet, or enough money to pay for messages. Some people, like women and teenagers, had others controlling their phone use. Also, people worried about keeping their private health information safe. To fix these problems, people suggested using simple language and making sure messages were sent at the right time. They also wanted to choose
We looked at 23 tests with 2467 people. We compared methadone to other medicines and found no big difference in how well they worked. Some people felt different symptoms depending on the medicine and program they used. It's hard to compare these tests because they are all different. The tests show that using slow-acting opioids can help with withdrawal, but many people still went back to using heroin.
We looked at nine studies with 1109 people to learn about different ways to help people stop using drugs. One way makes the withdrawal process stronger but shorter, and it helps people get better faster. However, this method can have more risks, especially if the person is very sleepy during the process. Being more sleepy doesn't make the withdrawal easier or help people start their new treatment faster. Since this method can be dangerous and expensive, it's not the best choice.
We looked at 14 studies about a medicine called molindone. Some studies were very short (10 days), and others lasted over three months. We couldn't find enough information to say if molindone works better than a fake medicine (placebo). When we compared molindone to other similar medicines, we didn't find any difference in how well they worked. Molindone doesn't cause more or fewer movement problems than other medicines, but it does make people lose more weight. The information we have about molindone is not very strong because the studies were small, not well-designed, and didn't give us enough
We looked at 20 studies with 2125 people trying 23 different skin treatments. We couldn't combine the data because the treatments were too different. The treatments included creams with special ingredients, like hydroquinone, and other methods like using vitamin C or special skin-lightening products. One cream with three ingredients worked better at lightening a skin problem called melasma than other combinations. A different cream, azelaic acid, also worked better than a weaker hydroquinone cream, but not as well as a stronger one. In two studies, another cream called tretinoin helped some people, but not everyone. Thios
This text talks about a review of 12 studies with 1319 people. The studies were not very high quality and had some problems. The people in the studies were between 61 and 75 years old, mostly white, and 40% were men. The studies lasted at least one year. The review found that a treatment called 5-FU helped some people who had eye surgery. It helped people who were at high risk of the surgery not working and those who had the surgery for the first time. The treatment also helped lower eye pressure in some groups. However, the treatment did not help everyone. It did not help
We looked at 55 studies with 16,154 people to see how using ICS (a type of medicine) for more than six months affected people with COPD (a lung disease). We found that ICS did not always help with breathing tests, but it did help some people in one big study. ICS did not change how long people with COPD lived, but it did help them have fewer breathing problems. ICS also helped people feel better in their daily lives. We could not tell if ICS would work based on other tests or how people reacted to other medicines. People who used ICS had more mouth infections
We looked at 80 studies with 5820 women. They compared 20 different pain medicines called NSAIDs to see which one works best for period pain. NSAIDs worked better than a fake medicine (placebo) for pain relief, but they also had more side effects. When comparing different NSAIDs, no one medicine was found to be the best for pain relief or safety. There were only two studies that used a special type of NSAIDs called COX-2-specific inhibitors, and there wasn't enough information to say if they were better or not. NSAIDs worked better than another pain medicine called paracetamol, but
We looked at seven studies about PEEP (a breathing treatment) with 2565 people. Five studies (2417 people) compared high and low PEEP with the same amount of air, while two studies (148 people) had different amounts of air. We found some problems in three studies, but the others were good quality. We checked if people died before leaving the hospital in the studies with the same amount of air. We used three studies for this and found no big difference between high and low PEEP. There was also no big difference in the risk of lung injury. However, people with high PEEP had better oxygen levels
This report looked at 42 studies with 11,399 patients. It found that people treated with a certain fluid called HES had a higher chance of having kidney problems compared to those treated with other fluids. The study also found that there was no safe amount of HES to use. It is better to use other fluids instead of HES to help patients.
We looked at nine studies with 682 people. The studies did not say how they picked groups. Seven studies had good information, and two studies had no other problems. They compared a plant called Rheum officinale to no treatment and a medicine called captopril. Rheum officinale helped with two things called SCr and BUN. But it did not show a big difference when compared to captopril. There was no information on how many people died or how much it cost. Only small problems happened with Rheum officinale. There is not enough good information to say if Rheum officinale helps people
We looked at 72 papers about a test called IQCODE and chose 13 of them. These papers had information from 2,745 people, and 1,413 of them had dementia. We found that the test works well to find out if someone has dementia. It works better in a general hospital than in a special memory place. The test is good at finding people who don't have dementia. It doesn't matter what language the test is in, it still works well. But, some of the papers we looked at had problems, so we need to be careful when using the test.
We looked at three studies with 91 people. All three studies were not very good and might have some mistakes. These studies looked at different ways to help people with arm stiffness after a stroke. They tried different exercises and treatments to see what worked best. Some treatments helped a little, but we need more research to know for sure. The studies only looked at adults and didn't include children or people with leg stiffness. We also don't know the best way to help people with their daily activities or how to make things easier for caregivers. More research is needed to find the best treatments for everyone.
We looked at four tests with 136 people. Two tests compared one medicine to another. In one test, they chose who got which medicine one week after a liver transplant. In another test, they chose after six months. In both tests, everyone got the same medicine until they chose who got which one. A third test compared using two medicines together to using just one after one month. A fourth test compared two different combinations of medicines after 12 months. There were no big differences in the results. All tests were open, and none had enough people to show if one treatment was better for stopping a virus from coming back. We couldn
We looked at many research articles about a health condition called LADA. We found 15 articles with information from 1019 people. These people were studied for different amounts of time, from 3 months to 10 years. The studies were not perfect and had some problems. We learned that some medicines, like sulphonylurea (SU) and insulin, did not help control LADA much better than just using insulin by itself. In fact, using SU sometimes made things worse. Some people needed insulin sooner when they took SU. We also found that using vitamin D with insulin might help protect special cells in the body. A
This text talks about a study that looked at how well certain programs worked to help college students drink less alcohol. They looked at 70 different studies with a lot of people in them. The results showed that these programs might not be very helpful. Some small changes were found, like students drinking a little less or not drinking as often, but these changes were not big enough to make a real difference. The researchers think that these programs might not be the best way to help college students drink less alcohol.
We looked at three tests with 492 people who had 530 hip surgeries. The information we found might not be very good because of some problems in the studies. One study with 81 people checked if using special hip care, tools, and limits helped them get better. We are not sure if this helped them feel better or have a better life after 12 months. No one's hip came out of place or had problems in the first 12 months after surgery. Another study with 265 people looked at using hip care with or without special tools and limits. We are not sure if people who didn't use the tools and limits
Three tests were done. In two tests, using a special device helped lower the return of painful periods for some women. More women were happy with this treatment, but it wasn't a big difference. More women also had changes in their periods with this device. In one test, women using the device had less pain than those using a different treatment, but it wasn't a big difference. There is some proof that this device helps with painful periods in women with a condition called endometriosis. More tests are needed to be sure.
We looked at 24 studies about food choices. Most of these studies had some problems, and they were mostly done in the USA with adults in a lab. They did not look at alcohol or tobacco. Some studies changed the number of food options or made healthier choices more common. These changes made people choose and eat less of the unhealthy foods, but we are not very sure about this result. Other studies changed how close or far away the food was from people. When food was farther away, people chose and ate less of it. This effect was stronger when there was only one type of food, when people had more money, and when
This text talks about a study on how to help people who might have been exposed to HIV at work. The study found that certain things made it more likely for someone to get HIV, like deep injuries or being around very sick patients. They looked at a medicine called zidovudine to see if it could help prevent HIV after someone was exposed. The study found that people who took the medicine were less likely to get HIV. The text also talks about using more than one medicine to help prevent HIV, but there isn't enough information to know if that works better. It's important for healthcare workers to know that taking these medicines might
There isn't much proof that behavior therapy helps a lot, but it can make people feel a little better right after treatment. CBT (a type of therapy) can help people with pain and other problems a little bit, but only right after treatment and when compared to not getting any treatment at all. CBT can also help people feel better and worry less, and sometimes these effects last for six months. Behavior therapy doesn't help with mood, but it can help people worry less right after treatment. CBT is a helpful way to deal with long-lasting pain. We don't need more big studies, but we need to find out
We looked at 881 documents and found 15 big projects about people eating less salt. These projects included over 260,000 people. We didn't find any projects in poorer countries. We studied each project separately because they were all very different. We could study 10 projects closely, and they had 64,798 people in them. Some projects helped people eat less salt, but others didn't. In some places like Finland and Ireland, people ate less salt after the project. In Canada and Switzerland, people ate more salt, but the information was old. In other places, there was no big change. Most of the projects
We looked at 18 studies about teeth grinding during sleep, but only seven were good enough to use. These studies had a small number of people, from seven to 16 in each. They tested different medicines to see if they helped with teeth grinding. The results were not very clear, and we don't know if the medicines really help or not. Some people who took the medicines had side effects like feeling sleepy, having a dry mouth, or low blood pressure in the morning. We need more and better studies to find out if these medicines work for teeth grinding during sleep. The new studies should have more people and be done in a
We looked at 10 studies with 1,015 people. These studies tested special food and extra omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. Some studies had problems, and they were all different in many ways. All studies talked about people who died. They found no big difference in deaths when using special food or extra omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. We are not sure if these things help people stay in the hospital for less time, use a breathing machine for fewer days, or breathe better on day 4. We are also not sure if they cause more heart problems, stomach problems, or other bad things. The information we have
In 33 studies, researchers compared different ways of asking people questions to find out about problems they experienced. They found that asking more specific questions helped find more problems than asking general questions. In some cases, serious problems were only found when people were interviewed. However, the studies did not agree on which method was best for finding different types of problems. The researchers could not make a final decision about which question method was best. They found that some problems might not be discovered if only general questions were asked. This could make it difficult to combine information from different studies. The researchers suggest that future studies should use clear definitions and ways of asking questions
We looked at 582 articles and found 10 more by searching other places. We took out 211 copies and checked 381 articles to see if they were good for our study. We didn't use 364 of them and looked closely at 17 articles. We didn't use 15 of them for different reasons. We used one study in our review, but it had some problems. This study showed that having someone watch over a person at night or using special tools like a listening device can help protect against SUDEP (a sudden death in people with epilepsy). We need more research to find out if other things, like special
We looked at 21 studies about a breathing technique called autogenic drainage for people with cystic fibrosis. We found seven studies that we could use for our review. These studies had different designs and included people of different ages and health conditions. They compared autogenic drainage to other ways of clearing the airways. We didn't find any studies that compared autogenic drainage to exercise, which is another way people with cystic fibrosis try to feel better. The quality of the studies we found was not very good. Some problems with the studies were that they used a certain design, didn't report all the results, and couldn't hide
We looked at 25 studies with 1305 people to see if a type of therapy called CBT helps with anxiety. We found that CBT works better than doing nothing or waiting for treatment. It helps people feel less anxious, worried, and sad. We don't know if CBT works better than other types of therapy because there aren't enough studies to compare them. We need more research to find out which therapy is best for treating anxiety.
Twelve studies with 1,856 women were looked at. Eight studies compared a treatment with a fake treatment, and four studies compared giving a hormone called progestogen with not giving any treatment. These studies were done in different countries like India, Jordan, UK, and USA. Some women in the studies had three or more miscarriages in a row, while others had two or more miscarriages in a row. The way the progestogen was given, how much was given, and how long it was given for was different in each study. Most of the studies were well done and not biased. Ten studies with 1,
We looked at 14 studies with 1,298 people. Nine studies (704 people) compared CM to a control group, and five studies (594 people) compared MIB to a control group. We didn't find any studies that looked at other ways to help people. It was hard to tell if the studies were done well because they didn't give enough information. We checked the studies for any problems. Most of the studies didn't look at how moms and babies were doing. For the ones that did, there was no difference in early births, moms being sick at delivery, or low birth weight. But, babies in the
We looked at 31 studies with 27,071 people and found that one method, called the transradial approach, was better than another method, called the transfemoral approach, for some things. The transradial approach had fewer problems and was safer for patients in the short-term. However, we don't know if it's better in the long-term.
We looked at two studies about special care for people with severe memory problems. The studies were different, so we couldn't combine their information. They measured 31 things but didn't measure the same thing. We know there are six more studies happening that we can look at later. Both studies had some problems, like not being able to hide who got the special care. This and having only a few people in the studies made us less sure about the results. One study looked at how a special care team helped people with severe memory problems in the hospital. They found that the special care plan was more likely to be made and used when leaving
We looked at three tests that compared two ways of treating cancer. There were no big differences in how well the treatments worked for 1166 women in these tests. Some side effects were more common with one treatment, like tiredness, skin changes, and color changes. Doctors noticed more side effects than the women did. One test with 244 women showed that doing one treatment before the other could cause more problems, but other side effects were the same. Overall, the order of treatments didn't make a big difference in how well they worked if they started within seven months after surgery.
We looked at nine studies with 622 people. These studies tested if CrP, a special thing, helps people lose weight. They tried different amounts of CrP to see which one works best. After 12 to 16 weeks, people who took CrP lost a little bit of weight, but it might not be important. We couldn't tell if one amount of CrP was better than another for losing weight. Only three studies talked about bad things that happened to people taking CrP. Two people taking a lot of CrP had serious problems, and one person taking a smaller amount had a serious problem. Two people taking a
We looked at 11 studies with 886 people to see how different treatments help with healing after surgery. Some studies were small and hard to understand, so the information wasn't very strong. We found no clear proof that using iodine helps with healing. One study showed that using zinc oxide might help with wound infections, but the proof was weak. Another study showed that sucralfate cream might help heal open wounds better than petrolatum cream, and this proof was a little stronger. Using Triclosan might help wounds heal faster, but the proof was weak. Honey-soaked gauze might help heal some wounds better than
We looked at five studies with 1049 women to see if different methods during two tests (amniocentesis and CVS) were helpful. We checked three methods for amniocentesis and two for CVS. We didn't find any clear benefits from these methods. The information we found isn't good enough to change how doctors do these tests. Doctors should keep using the methods they know best. If there are better studies in the future, we would like to see them.
We looked at 10 studies about adding folic acid to flour. These studies had different types of people and took place in different countries. Some studies used wheat flour, and others used maize flour. The studies lasted from two weeks to 36 months. One study found that adding folic acid to wheat flour helped lower the chances of certain birth defects. Pregnant women who ate maize porridge with folic acid had higher levels of folate in their blood. Folate is important for a healthy pregnancy. However, women who ate maize flour with folic acid did not have higher levels of folate in their blood. Adding folic
We looked at six studies about testing babies for a health problem called CF. Two of these studies had enough information for us to use. They studied over a million babies, and some of them had CF. We could only use the information from one study. The study showed that babies who were tested for CF had better health. They were less likely to be very underweight or short. When they were seven years old, more of them had healthy lungs compared to those who were not tested. Their chest X-rays also looked better at first. However, over time, the chest X-rays of the tested babies got worse. When we considered other
We looked at five studies with 7314 people and followed them for about 4.5 years. One study (ACCORD) compared two different blood pressure goals in 4734 people. The lower goal group had a smaller chance of having a stroke, but there was no big difference in other health problems. The lower goal also caused more serious side effects. Four other studies compared two different goals for another type of blood pressure in people with diabetes. The lower goal group had a small decrease in the chance of dying, but there was no big difference in other health problems. These studies did not report some important information. Right now,
We looked at 14 tests with 709 people to see how to best treat foot sores caused by diabetes. One test compared two kinds of casts that can't be taken off, but there was no big difference between them. Seven tests (with 366 people) compared casts that can't be taken off to special devices that can be taken off. In five of those tests, the casts that can't be taken off helped heal more sores than the devices that can be taken off. Two tests (with 98 people) showed that more sores healed with casts that can't be taken off than with just using bandages.
We looked at five studies about different ways to help breast cancer survivors with thinking and memory problems. These studies included 235 people and tried things like computer games, special strategies, meditation, and exercise. The studies had some problems, so we need to be careful with the results. The computer games and special strategies seemed to help with thinking, memory, and feeling good. But we couldn't tell if meditation and exercise helped. We need more and better studies to know for sure. It's also important to study other cancer patients, not just women with breast cancer.
We looked at 12 records about six tests. We used five tests with 343 people from the 1970s. We did not use one test. The tests were not done very well and only had short-term information. The results showed that there was no big difference between two medicines, chlorpromazine and piperacetazine, when a doctor checked how well people were doing. Both medicines had about the same side effects, and about 60% of people had some side effects. About 40% of those people had movement problems. There was no big difference in how many people left the study early. No test looked at
We looked at five studies with 207 people who had a problem in their large intestine. Half of them got a special tube called a stent, and the other half had emergency surgery. The surgery worked better than the stent, but both were safe. People who got the stent had a shorter hospital stay, less time in the procedure, and less blood loss. But, we need more studies with more people to know for sure which one is better.
We looked at nine studies with 1867 women to see if certain treatments could prevent a condition called OHSS. The treatments were human albumin, HES, and mannitol. The studies were not very good quality, and some had problems with how they were done. We found that giving albumin through a vein might help with OHSS, but it could also make it harder for women to get pregnant. HES might also help with OHSS, but we don't know if it affects pregnancy rates. Mannitol might help with OHSS too, but we don't know if it affects pregnancy rates either. None of the studies
We looked at ten studies with 484 patients. We found that no one treatment worked better than the others, but they all worked better than a fake treatment. People were not happier with one treatment over another, but they were less happy with the fake treatment. Some treatments had more side effects or were more painful than others. We need more research to find the best treatment and make patients happy. Future studies should include more information about the patients and their symptoms to help compare results.
We looked at seven studies with 241 people in this review. We couldn't combine the studies because they were too different and didn't give enough information. Most studies didn't explain their methods well. No study looked at how well medicines worked to prevent serious problems like death or heart issues. But, some treatments did help lower potassium levels in the blood. One treatment called salbutamol, given through a nebulizer or inhaler, helped lower potassium levels better than a fake treatment. Another treatment called insulin-dextrose also helped lower potassium levels. We don't know if other treatments like sodium bicarbonate, aminoph
This text talks about a study that looked at different ways to keep tubes called catheters clean and safe for people who need them for medical treatments. The study found that using special cleaning solutions can help reduce infections, but it's not clear if they also help prevent blood clots. The researchers think more studies need to be done to make sure these cleaning solutions are the best choice.
We looked at 15 studies with 1098 people. These studies checked different ways to treat a virus called CMV in patients who had organ transplants. We wanted to see which treatment was better and if there were any problems with the treatments. We found that one treatment called pre-emptive therapy helped to stop the CMV virus better than doing nothing or just waiting for the virus to show up. But, it didn't help with other problems like organ rejection or people dying. When we compared pre-emptive therapy to another treatment called prophylaxis, we couldn't tell which one was better because the studies were too different
We looked at three studies about sweet potatoes and how they affect people with type 2 diabetes. These studies had 140 people in total and lasted from six weeks to five months. The same person did all three studies, and we are not sure if they were done well or not. The studies compared sweet potatoes to a fake treatment to see if they helped control blood sugar levels. After three to five months, people who had 4 grams of sweet potatoes every day had a small improvement in their blood sugar levels compared to those who didn't. No one had any serious problems from eating sweet potatoes. The studies didn't look at other
We looked at 62 studies about a breathing technique. 19 of these studies had the right information for us to use. We found that people liked different breathing techniques, and some worked better for them than others. We couldn't find a big difference in how well people did with the different techniques. We need more studies to know which breathing technique is best for people with a lung problem called cystic fibrosis.
Eight studies with 733 women looked at two different ways to help women get pregnant. They found that a shorter method might help more women have ongoing pregnancies and become pregnant. But, they didn't find a difference in the number of miscarriages between the two methods. More studies are needed to see if the shorter method can also help with having more babies born and fewer miscarriages.
In five tests with 694 babies, a long breathing time made air leaks and deaths more likely. But, these tests were done before some new treatments were used. So, we should be careful when using these results. It's better to use a short breathing time for babies with weak lungs.
We looked at 33 studies with 5110 patients. Most of the studies were not very well done. TFU was used in many different patient groups. There were many different ways the TFU was done and many different results were measured. We could only compare a few results because the studies were so different. Out of eight comparisons, five had very different results. We can't say for sure if TFU works or not because the studies were not very good. No bad things happened because of TFU. Some studies showed good results, but overall, TFU and the control groups were about the same. In the end, we
We looked at 38 studies about keeping people in trials. These studies tested six ways to help people stay in the trials. They tried using rewards, different ways of talking, new questionnaires, helping participants, and changing behaviors and methods. Most of the studies (34) were about people answering questions through mail or online, sometimes with medical tests. In four studies, they counted how many people stayed in the trial. The studies were done in different places, with different health problems and settings. Some things that helped people stay in the trials were giving money rewards for answering questions by mail (18% more likely) or online (25%
We looked at eight studies with 829 people. They tested two different airway devices called pLMA and cLMA. We found no big differences between the devices in how well they worked. The pLMA made a better seal, which might be better for some breathing treatments. The cLMA was a little faster to put in, but that might not matter much. We need more information to be sure about these results.
We looked at 19 studies with 1453 kids aged 4-18 years from eight countries. These studies tested different ways to help kids with stomach pain. They tried probiotics (good bacteria), fiber, low FODMAP diets (foods that are easy to digest), and fructose-restricted diets (foods with less sugar). We found that probiotics helped reduce pain in kids with stomach pain. But, we need more research to know the best type and amount of probiotics to use. Fiber and special diets didn't show strong results in helping with stomach pain. We need more studies to learn about these treatments. Overall,
We looked at 22 studies with 4490 people. These studies tested if mass media (like TV, radio, and newspapers) can help reduce prejudice and discrimination. Prejudice is when someone judges another person without knowing them, and discrimination is when someone treats another person unfairly because of their race, gender, or other reasons. The results were mixed. Some studies showed that mass media can help reduce prejudice, but we don't know if it can reduce discrimination. We also don't know how much it costs to use mass media for this purpose, or if there are any bad effects. We need more research to find out if mass
We looked at 85 studies about pregnant women and their healthcare. These studies were from 41 countries with different levels of income and took place in cities, towns, and villages. We found 52 important points and grouped them into three main topics: culture, healthcare services, and what matters to women and healthcare workers. We learned that women will use healthcare services during pregnancy if they think it will be a good experience. Good healthcare services are kind, caring, respectful, and understand the woman's culture. They also give the right information and make sure the woman and her baby are safe. Women's opinions about healthcare during pregnancy depend on their
This text talks about a study with 16 tests and 3361 patients. They looked at how well certain medicines worked to help people with a specific health problem. The medicines they tested were called calcium antagonists, and they found that these medicines helped reduce the risk of bad results. One of these medicines, called nimodipine, worked well when taken by mouth. Another medicine, called magnesium sulphate, also showed some good results, but they need more information before they can say for sure. Overall, these medicines can help people with this health problem, but more research is needed.
We looked at three studies with 739 kids. All studies used one year old as the age to decide who gets what treatment. We found that one treatment, called myeloablative therapy, helped kids live without getting sick again better than other treatments. But when we added more information, it didn't help them live longer overall. We also looked at side effects and quality of life, but we couldn't make any final conclusions. We need more studies to find the best treatment plan for kids with high-risk neuroblastoma, a type of cancer. These studies should include kids with the same stage of cancer and age, and follow them
We looked at eight studies with 632 people to see if a certain treatment for liver cancer works. The people in the studies were between 16 and 78 years old. Most of them were men, and many had a serious type of liver cancer. We watched them for about a year. We found that using two treatments together might help people live longer and fight the cancer better. But, the two treatments together might also cause some side effects. We are not sure about these results because the studies were not very good. We need better studies to know if this treatment really works and is safe.
We couldn't find any tests that compared giving more food to babies with lung problems. We found 14 studies, but none of them were exactly what we needed. However, two of them gave us some ideas. One study showed that babies with lung problems who were given special formula with extra protein and minerals grew better until they stopped the special formula at three months old. Another study tried to give babies different amounts of food, but they couldn't eat as much as the study wanted them to. There were no differences in how the babies grew or how their lungs worked. Right now, there are no tests that look at giving more food to
In a study with 2341 people, researchers looked at how well a tool called two-dimensional ultrasound worked for a medical procedure. They found that using this tool made the procedure a little safer and better for some patients. The tool helped avoid some problems and made it more likely for the procedure to work on the first try. However, more research is needed to know if this tool is better for all patients and doctors.
Researchers did a study with 15 different tests to see how a medicine called physostigmine works for people with Alzheimer's disease. They tried four ways to give the medicine: through a needle in a vein, by mouth, with a special slow-release pill, and with a skin patch. The needle in the vein method didn't give any useful results. The regular pill didn't show any benefits compared to a fake pill (placebo). The slow-release pill helped some people, but many stopped taking it because of side effects like stomach problems and dizziness. The skin patch also caused side effects, and there was no difference in improvement
We looked at 13 studies with 16,112 people. Most of these people had heart problems. We found that a medicine called fibrates can help protect against some heart issues. Fibrates worked well to prevent heart attacks but did not help with other problems like death from heart issues or strokes. When we took out one type of fibrate that is not used anymore, the results changed a little. Fibrates still helped prevent heart attacks, but not as much. There were no extra bad side effects from using fibrates. More studies are needed to learn about fibrates and how they can help people with heart problems.
This text talks about a study with 3285 healthy women who were either having a planned C-section or a natural birth. The study looked at how a medicine called TA helped with blood loss during and after giving birth. The women in the study also took other medicines to help with this. The study found that women who took TA had less blood loss and needed fewer extra medical treatments and blood transfusions. This was true for both C-sections and natural births. However, women who took TA had more minor side effects like nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The study couldn't tell if TA had any serious side effects or if it
We looked at 12 studies with 2494 people (1586 kids and 908 older people) to see if two medicines, amantadine and rimantadine, could help treat a sickness called influenza A. We compared these medicines to a fake medicine (placebo), a common medicine (paracetamol), and another medicine (zanamivir). Amantadine helped stop influenza A in kids, but we don't know if it's safe. Rimantadine helped kids feel better by lowering their fever on the third day of treatment. However, rimantadine didn't help older people avoid
This text talks about a study that looked at 1512 women who had trouble getting pregnant. The study tested if a special treatment called endometrial injury could help these women have a baby. The results are not very clear, and the study is not sure if the treatment works or not. The study also looked at how much pain the women felt during the treatment, but only one part of the study talked about this. The study did not find any big differences in other things like miscarriages or multiple pregnancies. In the end, more research is needed to know if this treatment can really help women have a baby.
We looked at four studies with 3905 people. These studies compared professional mouth care to regular mouth care. One study with 834 people was stopped because there was no clear difference between the two groups. We couldn't tell if professional mouth care helped lower the chances of getting pneumonia in nursing homes over 18 months or 24 months. There was some evidence that professional mouth care might lower the risk of dying from pneumonia, but we're not sure. We also don't know if professional mouth care can lower the risk of dying from any cause. Only one study looked at side effects, and they found no serious problems. No studies compared
Five studies with 149 people were looked at. They tested different medicines to see which worked best for a health problem called lymphocytic colitis. Some of the studies had problems, like not enough people or not being fair. One medicine called budesonide seemed to help more than a fake medicine (placebo). But, more tests are needed to be sure. Another medicine called mesalazine might also help, with or without another medicine called cholestyramine. A third medicine called beclometasone dipropionate could help too, but more tests are needed for both of these. A fourth medicine called b
We looked at 12 studies with 3259 patients to see how checking blood sugar levels helps people with type 2 diabetes who don't use insulin. The studies lasted from 6 months to 12 months. We found that checking blood sugar levels can help a little bit for up to 6 months, but after 12 months, it doesn't help much. It also doesn't make people feel better or improve their quality of life. We also looked at how much it costs to check blood sugar levels. One study said it costs 12 times more to check blood sugar than to check urine sugar. Another study showed different costs for
Eleven studies looked at how to help people with AsPD, a behavior problem. But, only five studies had enough information. They tried different ways to help these people, like talking to them or giving them rewards. Some ways worked better than others, but none of them were perfect. Most of the time, they only helped with problems like using drugs or alcohol. We need more research to find better ways to help people with AsPD.
This report looked at 11 studies about colds and nose infections. They found that antibiotics did not help people with colds get better. In fact, adults had more side effects from taking antibiotics for colds. For nose infections, antibiotics also did not help much and caused more side effects. The report suggests that it is not a good idea to use antibiotics for colds and nose infections.
We looked at five studies with 162 people to see if certain treatments help with two types of skin problems called guttate psoriasis and chronic plaque psoriasis. The people in the studies were between 12 and 77 years old. Some of the treatments tested were penicillin, erythromycin, rifampicin, azithromycin, and tonsillectomy (removing the tonsils). The studies were not very good, and we are not sure if the treatments work or are safe. We need more and better studies to know if these treatments help, especially for kids and young adults with gutt
We looked at 12 studies with 933 people who have MS. They were split into two groups: one took vitamin D and the other did not. Most of the studies tested vitamin D₃, and one tested vitamin D₂. The results showed that vitamin D₃ did not make a big difference in how often people had MS relapses, how bad their disability was, or what their brain scans looked like after a year. Vitamin D₃ also did not cause serious or minor side effects. Some studies looked at how people felt overall, but the results were not clear. One study said vitamin D helped with mental and social
We looked at seven new studies, but only used one because the others had problems. In total, we used 62 studies with 4,241 people. These studies tested different ways to give a pain medicine called morphine to help people with cancer pain. Some ways worked better than others, but overall, morphine helped most people feel less pain. We found that morphine can be given in different forms and at different times, but it usually works well. Some people had side effects from the medicine, and a few stopped taking it because of that. The studies we looked at were not perfect, but they showed that morphine is
This text talks about a study that looked at different ways to treat a problem called trigger finger. They studied 14 different trials with 1260 people who had this problem. Most of the people in the study were women, and they were between 16 and 88 years old. The study compared different treatments like surgery, injections, and other methods. The main comparison was between surgery and steroid injections. Surgery is a common treatment, while steroid injections are less invasive and often used first. The study found that surgery might be better at preventing the problem from coming back, but it can be more painful. However, the quality of the evidence
Three studies with 931 people tested different treatments for a health problem. They tried radiation therapy (RT) alone, RT with special medicines (PCV), PCV alone, and another medicine called temozolomide. The studies were not perfect, but they found that RT with PCV helped people live longer than just RT alone. Ten years after the study, they found that some people with certain body markers lived even longer with the combined treatment. These markers were found in two of the studies and helped predict how well people would do. The third study looked at these markers and found they helped predict how long people would live without getting
We looked at five studies with 240 kids aged one to 18 years who had mild to moderate sleep problems. These studies were done in special sleep clinics. They checked the kids after six weeks to four months. Three studies compared nose sprays to fake treatments, and two studies compared a medicine called montelukast to fake treatments. We left out one study because it had some problems. We are not sure if the nose spray helps kids sleep better (2 studies, 75 kids; low certainty). But kids who took montelukast had better sleep (2 studies, 103 kids; moderate certainty). We are not sure
This text talks about a study that looked at different treatments to prevent blood clots in children with cancer who have special tubes called CVCs. The study found that none of the treatments were better than doing nothing to prevent blood clots. However, this might be because there were not enough children in the study. One treatment, called LMWH, did help when added to another treatment called AT. There were no big differences in side effects between the different treatments. The study suggests that more research is needed to find the best way to prevent blood clots in these children.
Three tests were done on 287 people who had a special surgery. In the first test, 98 people were checked for problems with their legs. Some people had problems, but the treatment didn't help much. In the second test, 33 people were given a different treatment, and it helped more. In the third test, 145 people had the surgery, and the treatment helped a lot. Overall, the treatment helped reduce problems after the surgery. But, more studies are needed to know if it's really good for preventing problems with the nerves.
We looked at 13 studies with 662 people. We wanted to see how well different treatments worked for skin problems like psoriasis. We looked at how much better people felt, how many people had a big improvement, how many people stopped treatment because of side effects, and how many people's skin got completely better. We found that some treatments worked better than others, but the results were not always the same in every study. Some treatments worked well for certain types of skin problems, but not for others. We also found that some treatments were easier to use than others. We need more research to know which treatments are best for different skin
We found 21 studies with 1525 people in them. Some of the studies were good, and some were not as good. One study showed that doing exercises with biofeedback was better than just doing exercises. Another study showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than just electrical stimulation. Two studies showed that using electrical stimulation with biofeedback was better than just biofeedback. Sacral nerve stimulation was better than just doing exercises and biofeedback. We don't know if one type of biofeedback or exercise is better than another. Some people think that training to feel how full your rectum is can help, but we need more
We looked at 39 tests to learn about using tubes called catheters after surgery. The tests were small and not very good, so we can't be sure about the results. When people didn't use a catheter after surgery, they sometimes needed to use it again later. We're not sure if using a catheter makes infections more likely. There are two types of catheters: urethral and suprapubic. People needed to use a catheter again more often if they used a urethral one after surgery. In some tests, taking out the catheter sooner (like after 1 day instead of
Ten studies with 3340 people were looked at. They tested a medicine called aripiprazole against a fake medicine (placebo) and other medicines like lithium and haloperidol. Aripiprazole helped reduce some symptoms better than the fake medicine after three and four weeks, but not after six weeks. It did not work better than the other medicines. Aripiprazole caused more movement problems and stomach issues like nausea and constipation. It also affected a hormone called prolactin in kids and teenagers. More studies are needed to know the best way to use aripiprazole for treating people with
Two studies looked at special treatments for infections in kids with cancer. They compared using extra medicine with just using regular medicine. The studies were not perfect and had some differences. They found no big changes between the two treatments. Some problems happened with the special treatments, but they were not too bad. More good studies are needed to learn about these treatments for kids with cancer.
In a study with 15 tests, three had a low chance of being wrong. They looked at three main ideas. One idea was about helping people be more active. A video about being active helped people with neck pain feel better for a short time, but not for a long time. A pamphlet about being active didn't help much with pain or other problems. Other ways of teaching didn't show much difference either. Another idea was about dealing with pain, stress, and making workspaces better. These tests didn't show much difference or improvement for people with neck pain. The last idea was about taking care of yourself. This test
This text talks about a review that looked for studies about how to tell people they might have a sickness called CJD or vCJD and help them after. They didn't find any studies that fit their rules, but they found 49 other things to read and learn from. They learned that good communication is important and should happen over time, be made just for the person, and have support like education and health care. Bad communication can cause problems like not getting the right health care. There isn't enough strong information to know the best way to tell people about CJD or vCJD risk and help them after. The things they
We looked at one study about a medicine (oxycodone/naloxone) for restless legs. The study had 304 people, but only 204 finished it. The medicine helped people feel better and sleep better than a fake medicine (placebo). But, some people had side effects like stomach problems, tiredness, and headaches. We need more studies to know if this medicine is safe.
We looked at 15 different studies with 1022 grown-ups who had broken wrists. These studies compared two ways to treat the broken wrists: using an outside support (external fixation) or a plaster cast. The studies were different in many ways, like the people in them and the treatments used. Some of the studies had problems, like not hiding which treatment people got and not checking the results well enough. Using an outside support helped keep the broken wrist in place better than a plaster cast. It also stopped the wrist from getting worse later on. But we don't know if one treatment is better than the other for helping people feel better
We looked at five studies with 1127 patients to learn about removing kidney stents early or late. The studies were mostly good and used a fair way to test the question. We are not sure if taking out stents early or late is better for avoiding a problem called MUC. But, taking out stents early might help lower the chances of getting a UTI, especially if a certain type of stent called a BI stent is used. If a different stent called a PU stent is used, there is no clear difference in UTI chances. We don't have information on how this affects money or how people
We looked at five studies about teeth treatments. They compared three different things. Four studies compared crowns and fillings. Two studies compared regular crowns with a special kind of filling. Two other studies compared crowns put on with the Hall Technique and fillings. One study also compared crowns with a different treatment that doesn't fix the tooth. Another study compared two kinds of crowns: regular crowns and pretty crowns with white covers. We didn't find any studies that compared different ways to put on crowns. We looked at how well the treatments worked right after the dentist visit and later on. Some things we wanted to
This text talks about a review of 28 studies with 788 people, both kids and adults. The studies looked at different ways to help people with a lung problem called CF breathe better. The main way they tested was called PEP, and they compared it to other methods. They found that PEP worked well for most people and was liked by the people who used it. Some studies showed that PEP was better than other methods, but more research is needed to be sure. It is important to find the best way to help each person with CF breathe better, because everyone is different.
Four studies with 1485 people who had a bad stomach problem called CD were looked at. These people were mostly adults over 18 years old. The studies tested a medicine called CZP to see if it helped the stomach problem. The results showed that CZP was better than a fake medicine (placebo) in helping people feel better after 8 weeks. Some people had serious side effects like worse stomach problems, infections, and cancer. It is not sure if CZP causes more side effects than the fake medicine. More studies are needed to see if CZP is safe and works well for a long time.
We looked at 112 studies about people with kidney problems and heart failure. These studies had different numbers of people and lasted for different amounts of time. We found that it is not clear how well different medicines work for these people because there is not enough information. Some medicines might help with heart problems, but they might also cause other issues like high potassium levels. We need more research to understand how to best treat people with both kidney problems and heart failure.
Three studies with 1945 women were looked at. The results were mixed. No serious problems or deaths happened to the mothers or babies. The babies' health scores and other measurements were not very different between the groups. The way babies were born, like with help from tools or surgery, was also not very different. The studies did not find any big differences between two ways of checking the mothers during labor. Since there were only three studies, we can't say for sure which way is better for women who need help during labor.
We looked at two tests with 54 people who have CVI. Many results were not reported or only in one study. Both studies measured how bad the disease was but used different ways, so we couldn't combine the information. One study found no difference between exercise and no exercise, while the other found less symptoms with exercise. One study found some improvements with exercise, but no difference in quality of life or ankle movement. There was no information on leg ulcers, surgeries, or exercise ability. Both studies might have problems, so we should be careful with the results. We couldn't check for other issues because there were only a few
We looked at 76 tests about different treatments for knee pain. These treatments were compared to see which ones worked better. Some treatments helped with pain and movement, especially 5 to 13 weeks after getting the treatment. Some treatments worked better than others, but we need more tests to know for sure. Most of the treatments were safe and did not cause many problems. Overall, these tests show that some treatments can help with knee pain.
We looked at 10 studies with 4052 people to learn about different treatments for heavy bleeding after giving birth. We compared a medicine called misoprostol with other treatments. We found that misoprostol did not help more than the other treatments in preventing serious problems for mothers. We also found that misoprostol caused more side effects like vomiting and shivering. Another medicine called oxytocin worked better and had fewer side effects than misoprostol. When used with other treatments, misoprostol and oxytocin worked about the same. We need more research to learn about other treatments like tranexamic acid
Six tests met the requirements. Most patients in these tests were born early. Five small tests looked at adding cysteine to a special food for a short time. One big test looked at adding N-acetylcysteine to a different special food for very small babies (weighing 1000 grams or less). Growth was not changed much by adding cysteine (1 test) or N-acetylcysteine (1 test). Adding cysteine helped keep more nitrogen in the body (4 tests). Cysteine levels in the blood went up when cysteine was added, but not when
We looked at 77 studies with 6287 people to see if certain treatments help people with liver problems. We found that the information from these studies was not very good. Some of the studies were about people with liver problems caused by things other than alcohol. Some studies were about people with diabetes, and some were about people without diabetes. The studies lasted from one month to two years. We looked at three types of treatments: antioxidants, bile acids, and thiazolidinediones. We wanted to see if these treatments helped people live longer, have fewer serious health problems, or have a better quality of life. We found that there
In 15 studies, 1282 people with memory problems were tested to see if they would develop Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. The studies looked at different ways to test for Alzheimer's using a special fluid from the body called CSF. The tests were not perfect, and sometimes they were right and sometimes they were wrong. The studies had some problems, like not having enough people or not doing the tests the same way. Because of these problems, it is hard to know if these tests are good for finding Alzheimer's disease in real life. More studies need to be done to make sure the tests work well and don't
We looked at three studies with 170 men who had a special kind of surgery for their prostate. The men were between 50 and 75 years old. We wanted to see if there was a difference in pain and other side effects after the surgery when using two different types of sleep medicine (anaesthetics). We found that there was not a big difference in pain between the two types of sleep medicine. One type of sleep medicine, called propofol, might help with less throwing up after surgery and might help with eye pressure during surgery. But, we are not sure if this is really important for the patients. We need more
We looked at 14 studies with 1,601,515 people to see if using skin creams with corticosteroids during pregnancy caused problems for the baby. Most studies found no link between using these creams and issues like how the baby was born, birth defects, low birth weight, early birth, baby's death, or low Apgar score (a test to check the baby's health right after birth). We also checked if the strength of the corticosteroid in the cream made a difference. We found no link between the strength of the cream and problems for the baby. However, some studies showed that using strong cort
We looked at four studies about treating eye infections with and without a special medicine called corticosteroids. There were 611 people in these studies, and they were done in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa. The studies checked how well people could see after the treatment and if there were any problems. They found no big differences between the groups with and without corticosteroids. One study said that the healing process was slower in the group with corticosteroids, but another study did not find any difference. There were no big differences in side effects between the two groups. One study checked if people felt better after
We did a study with 450 people in four different tests. We looked at how well they were doing and if they were alive at the end of the study for 443 people in three tests. We compared two treatments for a type of stroke. One treatment was given through a needle in a vein, and the other was a surgery to fix blood vessels. We found that the surgery did not make people do better than the needle treatment. The information we got was not very strong because some parts of the study were not hidden from the doctors or the people in the study. At the end, more people died in the surgery group, but
We looked at one study with 120 families and 143 kids. The study was not perfect because some people in the control group used day care services too. The study did not find any proof that day care centers helped or hurt kids' thinking skills or how they acted with others. The study also did not find any proof that day care centers helped or hurt parents' jobs or how much money they made. The study did not look at how kids did in the long run, like finishing high school or making money. We need more studies to know if day care centers are good for kids under five years old and their families in rich countries
We found 126 reports about 30 different scoring systems. Eleven of these systems have been checked to see if they work well. Eight systems were tested to see if the same person gets the same score each time. All eleven systems were tested to see if different people get the same score. Three systems were checked for good content. Two systems were tested to see if they measure what they should. Six systems were checked for good content. Two systems were tested to see if they can show changes over time. The Nancy Index and the Robarts Histopathology Index have been tested the most, but none of the systems are perfect yet. We
We looked at three studies that compared two ways of fixing broken leg bones in 213 people. Most of them were men, and their ages were between 41 and 44 years old. There were no studies comparing surgery with non-surgery treatments. The studies we looked at had some problems, so we are not very sure about the results. We found a small difference in how well people's feet and ankles worked after the two treatments, but it was not a big enough difference to matter. We also looked at how many people needed more surgery or special help because of problems. Fewer people needed more help after one treatment, but it
We looked at 11 studies with 38,742 people. Eight studies compared blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs) to no treatment (35,110 people), and three studies compared different blood pressure goals (3,632 people). The studies had different levels of quality. We found that BPLDs helped lower the chances of having another stroke, major blood vessel problems, and memory loss. These drugs worked best when they were a certain type, like ACE inhibitors or diuretics. We also found that having a lower blood pressure goal might help prevent more strokes and blood vessel problems. Our results show that BPLDs can
In a study, 519 men took part in four different tests that lasted between 4 to 26 weeks. These tests were about a substance called B-sitosterols. The results showed that B-sitosterols helped improve how well the men could pee and how much pee was left in their bladder after peeing. However, B-sitosterols did not make their prostate smaller. Some men stopped taking part in the study, but the number of men who stopped was almost the same for those who took B-sitosterols and those who took a fake pill. The study shows that B-sitosterols can help
This text talks about a study that looked at how a medicine called salmeterol affects people with asthma. They compared it to a fake medicine (placebo) and another medicine called salbutamol. The study had a lot of people in it, including some kids. The results showed that some bad things happened to people who took salmeterol, but it wasn't a big difference compared to the fake medicine. When they compared salmeterol to salbutamol, they didn't find any big differences in bad things happening. In two big studies, they found that people who took salmeterol and didn't use a special
Two studies looked at babies born early with breathing problems. In one study, some babies got a special medicine called L-thyroxine, while others did not. In another study, some babies got a different medicine called L-triiodothyronine, while others did not. Both studies had some issues, like not being very careful about how they chose which babies got the medicine. In the end, neither study found that the medicines helped the babies with their breathing problems or made them healthier. When looking at the results from both studies together, there was no difference in how many babies survived or needed help breathing. The studies also did
We looked at 38 studies with 1828 people. These studies tested if non-absorbable disaccharides, a type of medicine, can help people with liver problems. We found that this medicine can help lower the risk of death and improve liver health. It can also help reduce serious problems related to liver disease. However, this medicine can cause some minor side effects, mostly related to the stomach. We also compared two types of non-absorbable disaccharides, lactulose and lactitol, and found no big differences between them. Overall, our review shows that non-absorbable disaccharides can
In a 2019 study, researchers looked at 65 studies with 3598 people to learn about different treatments for bone problems after a kidney transplant. They studied medicines like bisphosphonates, vitamin D, and others. Most of the studies lasted for 12 months. The main goal was to see if these treatments could help prevent broken bones, but they also looked at other things like bone pain and how well the new kidney worked. They found that bisphosphonates might help prevent broken bones and reduce bone pain, but they were not sure about other treatments. They also found that bisphosphonates might cause
Four tests with 317 people were done to see if magnesium helps with alcohol withdrawal. Three tests used magnesium taken by mouth, and one test used magnesium given through a needle. The tests were not perfect and had some differences. We couldn't find a test that measured everything we wanted. Only one test looked at things like seizures and other alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Three tests (with 113 people) checked hand strength, but there was no big change in the magnesium group. No major side effects were reported. We don't know if magnesium is good or bad for treating alcohol withdrawal because there isn't enough information.
We looked at 15 studies with 3057 people. These studies tested if antibiotics help with a sickness called rhinosinusitis. Without antibiotics, 46% of people got better after 1 week and 64% got better after 14 days. Antibiotics can help people get better faster, but only a few more people will get better quicker if they take antibiotics. Antibiotics can also cause side effects. Because of this, we think antibiotics should not be used for people with simple rhinosinusitis. We don't know if this is true for children, people with weak immune systems, or people with severe sinusitis because
Eight studies with 2515 patients were looked at. Three studies from Asia compared two types of surgery for stomach cancer, called D3 and D2. There was no big difference in how long people lived after the surgeries, and the number of people who died after surgery was also not very different. Only one study had information about how long it took for the cancer to come back. Five other studies (three from Europe and two from Asia) compared D2 and D1 surgeries. There was no big difference in how long people lived or how long it took for the cancer to come back. However, people who had D2 surgery had
This text talks about a review of 13 studies with 1158 people. They looked at a medicine called naltrexone and compared it to other treatments or no treatment at all. They found that naltrexone did not work better than the other treatments in most cases. The only time it worked better was when it helped keep people out of jail, but this was only in two studies. When people had to take naltrexone, it did help them stay in treatment and not use drugs. But when compared to other treatments like psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, and buprenorphine, there was
We looked at two studies about changing the thickness of drinks for people with dementia and Parkinson's disease. These studies wanted to see if thicker drinks could help people swallow better and not get sick. The first study tested different thicknesses of drinks right away, and the second study tested them over three months. Thicker drinks seemed to help people swallow better at first, but after three months, some people got sick more often. We don't know if changing the thickness of drinks is good or bad for people with dementia in the long run. More studies are needed to find out.
Six studies with 788 women were looked at. The biggest study had 396 women. They compared natural cycle IVF and standard IVF to see which one had better results. They found no big difference in live birth rates, pregnancy rates, or other factors. They also found that the number of eggs collected was lower in the natural cycle group. The results were not very clear, and more studies are needed. In the future, they should compare natural cycle IVF and standard IVF and look at live birth rates, pregnancy rates, how many tries it takes, costs, and side effects.
We looked at 984 people from 12 studies about Tai Chi and breathing exercises. We found that Tai Chi helped people walk longer distances and breathe better. But, we don't know if it helps with feeling less out of breath or having a better life. We also don't know if Tai Chi helps with exercise, balance, or strength. When we compared Tai Chi with other exercises, we didn't see any extra benefits. No one got hurt doing Tai Chi, so it's safe for people with breathing problems. We need more studies to find the best way to do Tai Chi.
We looked at 72 tests with 2470 people. This review has 35 new studies added to the old ones. The studies had different goals and used different virtual reality devices. Some studies had unclear results because of poor reporting. Even though there are many tests, the evidence is mostly low quality. Control groups usually didn't get any treatment or got standard care. When comparing virtual reality to regular therapy, there was no big difference in arm function. But when virtual reality was added to usual care, there was a noticeable difference. There were no big differences in walking speed or balance. There were some improvements in daily activities, but we
We looked at five studies with 1330 people to see how a certain medicine works for a sickness. None of the studies were shorter than six months. We found three different ways the medicine was used: 1. One study (174 people) added a medicine called levofloxacin to the usual treatment. We don't know if it helped with getting better or having fewer side effects (not feeling well because of the medicine). 2. Three studies (723 people) replaced a medicine called ethambutol with other medicines in the usual treatment. We don't know if this helped with getting better or having fewer side effects. 3.
