"In 38 studies with 7843 children, educational interventions were given to children, parents, or both. This resulted in a lower risk of emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and unscheduled doctor visits compared to those who did not receive the intervention. However, there was not enough data to determine if education had an effect on other asthma symptoms or quality of life. It is still unclear what type of education is most effective in reducing acute care utilization."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 130 studies with 8341 participants who had different types of surgeries. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants were controls. Most studies had low or uncertain risk of bias, but had small sample sizes resulting in high heterogeneity. We found that perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity, and increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request. Ketamine also reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia and postoperative nausea and vomiting. There were no differences in CNS adverse events between ketamine and control. Overall, perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain intensity, and postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small extent."<|endoftext|>"A vaccine called MSP/RESA was tested in five trials with 217 participants. Two trials reported on how well the vaccine worked, and all five reported on safety. No serious side effects were reported when participants received doses of 13 to 15 µg of each antigen (39 to 45 µg total). In one trial with 17 people who were not immune to malaria, the vaccine did not reduce or delay parasite growth rates. In another trial with 120 children aged five to nine in Papua New Guinea, the vaccine reduced parasite density only in children who had not taken an antimalarial drug before. The vaccine was effective against one type of parasite but not another. The vaccine shows promise in reducing the severity of malaria episodes, but more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses four studies that looked at the effects of electromagnetic fields on bone healing in 125 participants with delayed union and non-union of long bones. The studies were blinded and randomized, but each had limitations. The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of participants whose fractures had healed at a fixed time point. The overall effect size was small and not statistically significant, and there was substantial heterogeneity among the studies. A sensitivity analysis showed that the effect size remained non-significant at 24 weeks. Two trials found no reduction in pain, and no study reported functional outcomes. One trial reported two minor complications. The available evidence suggests that electromagnetic field stimulation may offer some benefit, but more well-conducted trials are needed to draw definitive conclusions."<|endoftext|>"1831 participants were divided into two groups in 12 trials. Two trials had low risk of bias. Most trials involved patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The average age of participants was between 48 and 63 years, and the proportion of females was between 55.0% and 79.0%. There was no significant difference in short-term mortality, serious adverse events, or quality of life between the drain and 'no drain' groups. The proportion of patients discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy was significantly lower in the drain group. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay or return to normal activity and work between the groups. The operating time was significantly longer in the drain group. There is no evidence to support the routine use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and more trials are needed."<|endoftext|>"This text talks about a review of 49 trials conducted in China with 3639 participants testing 38 different herbal medicines for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The trials reported on symptom improvement and changes in nerve conduction velocity, but the positive results are of questionable significance due to low methodological quality. Adverse events were inadequately reported, and there is no evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy. No well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial has been conducted."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at five studies involving 1382 patients with advanced prostate cancer. The studies were small and short, and didn't look at disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study looked at biochemical outcomes, and found no significant differences between two treatments (IAS and CAS) for patients with Gleason scores 4-6, 7, and 8-10. However, for patients with a Gleason score >6, IAS was better at reducing biochemical progression. The studies mostly reported on adverse events, and one study found that IAS had fewer adverse effects than CAS, except for impotence which was lower in the IAS group. The studies were limited by small sample size and short duration, and didn't look at overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. Overall, IAS was as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles."<|endoftext|>"We found 12 trials involving 7,119 participants that used random assignment. Five of these trials compared immediate and delayed insertion of an IUD. One trial found that immediate insertion of the Copper 7 IUD had a higher risk of expulsion than delayed insertion. Three trials found that immediate insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or CuT380A IUDs had a higher risk of use and expulsion compared to delayed insertion. Another trial found that discontinuation rates due to pregnancy were higher for women using the Nova T IUD compared to the levonorgestrel IUD. Seven trials only examined immediate insertion of an IUD. Two multicenter trials found that the TCu 220C IUD had lower rates of pregnancy and expulsion compared to the Lippes Loop IUD. The TCu 220C IUD also had lower rates of pregnancy and expulsion compared to the Copper 7 IUD. Adding copper sleeves to the Lippes Loop IUD improved efficacy and reduced expulsion. It is safe and practical to insert an IUD immediately after an abortion, but there is a higher risk of expulsion compared to delayed insertion. However, six months after an abortion, IUD use is higher following immediate insertion compared to delayed insertion"<|endoftext|>"We only found one small trial that was published as an abstract article. The study looked at how meditation affected patients with acute leukaemia who were newly hospitalized. 91 people joined the study, but only 42 stayed in it for the full six months and were analyzed. We don't know the average age or sex of the participants. Because of missing data, we think there is a high risk of bias in the study. We judged the overall quality of the evidence as ""very low"" because of the missing data and small sample size. We can't give more details because the abstract only provided P values. The study suggests that meditation might improve the quality of life for patients with haematological diseases and decrease depression levels. However, we don't know if meditation affects overall survival, fatigue, anxiety, quality of sleep, or adverse events. We need more high-quality studies to understand the effects of meditation on patients with haematological malignancies."<|endoftext|>"We found three studies involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The studies were different in quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up, and outcomes measured, so we couldn't combine the results. Two of the studies had a high or unclear risk of bias. Overall, 23% of vaccine recipients got varicella compared to 78% of those who didn't get the vaccine. Most of the vaccinated children who got varicella had a mild form of the disease. In all three studies, most children got the vaccine within three days of being exposed to varicella. Not enough children got the vaccine four to five days after exposure to know if it works that late. None of the studies reported any bad effects from the vaccine. These small studies suggest that giving varicella vaccine to children within three days of being exposed to someone with varicella can reduce the number of infections and make the disease less severe. There were no studies on teenagers or adults, and we don't know if the vaccine is safe."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed 12 studies with 4704 participants. Most studies compared different antibiotic treatments to prevent infections after surgery, but one study compared antibiotic treatment to no treatment. Most studies had a high risk of bias and did not test for MRSA before surgery. We could not combine the results of the studies to make a conclusion. Four studies reported deaths, but there were no significant differences between the groups. No serious side effects were reported from the antibiotics. None of the studies reported on quality of life, length of hospital stay, or healthcare use. Overall, 5.5% of people developed infections, and 1% of people developed MRSA infections. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed infections between different antibiotic treatments. One study found that co-amoxiclav reduced the risk of MRSA infections compared to no treatment. There is not enough evidence to recommend using multiple antibiotics or longer treatment to prevent MRSA infections after surgery. More studies are needed to determine the best antibiotic treatment for preventing infections after surgery."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two studies comparing home and hospital care for women with PPROM, but the number of women in each study was too small to draw any conclusions. One study reported perinatal mortality, but we couldn't determine if it was different between the two groups. There were no differences in serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, or admission to neonatal intensive care. We don't have information on serious maternal morbidity or mortality. Women in hospital care were more likely to have a caesarean section, but this result should be interpreted cautiously. Women who received care at home spent less time in the hospital, were more satisfied with their care, and it was less expensive. We need larger studies to determine if there are any meaningful differences between the two groups. We should also consider maternal satisfaction and cost analysis in future studies."<|endoftext|>"The two ways to close the skin after a caesarean are staples and sutures. Studies show that both methods have similar rates of wound infection and other complications for women with Pfannenstiel incisions. However, the effect of staples may vary depending on the type of skin incision. Staples have a higher risk of skin separation and may need to be removed earlier than sutures. There is no clear evidence on which method is better, but staples and sutures are the most commonly used. If staples are removed on day three, there is a higher chance of skin separation and the need for reclosure compared to sutures."<|endoftext|>"We found 11 studies with 821 participants, with two more studies waiting to be classified and one ongoing study. Seven studies looked at green tea and four looked at black tea, but the amount and form of tea used varied between studies. No studies reported any heart problems. Black tea was found to lower LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, but only a few studies looked at this and they may not be completely reliable. Green tea was also found to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, but again, only a few studies looked at this and the results may not be completely reliable. When both types of tea were looked at together, they seemed to have a positive effect on LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. Some studies reported adverse events, but they were not directly related to the tea. There are not many long-term studies on the use of tea to prevent heart disease, so more high-quality studies are needed to confirm these findings."<|endoftext|>"Two small trials with 23 participants met the review criteria, but there was no data on oral steroid consumption and participants may have had comorbid lung disease. The studies did not show significant differences in lung function or symptoms, except for one study that showed a difference in SGaw, but it is unclear if this is clinically important. However, the studies had limitations such as small sample sizes and methodological issues, so the findings cannot be applied to steroid tapering. No new studies were found in an update search. There is currently not enough evidence to support the use of azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent for chronic asthma. Large, long-term studies with defined steroid reduction protocols are needed before making recommendations for clinical practice."<|endoftext|>"We found 56 studies with a total of 4068 participants, most of whom had breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 38 comparisons showed that exercise was more effective than the control intervention in reducing fatigue for 1461 participants who received exercise and 1187 control participants. Exercise was most effective during or after cancer therapy for breast and prostate cancer patients, but not for those with haematological malignancies. Aerobic exercise was found to be the most effective in reducing fatigue, while resistance training and other forms of exercise did not show significant results. In conclusion, aerobic exercise can be beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. However, more research is needed to determine the best type, intensity, and timing of exercise intervention."<|endoftext|>"We found five eligible trials with a total of 3427 adult participants. The trials were conducted in Germany, Italy, and Belgium. The risk of bias was low for overall survival but high for other outcomes. The addition of results from one trial showed that BEACOPP escalated improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to ABVD. There was no difference in treatment-related mortality or overall secondary malignancies, but there may be an increased risk of MDS or AML with BEACOPP escalated. The evidence for infertility is very low quality. BEACOPP escalated may cause more haematological toxicities. Only one trial assessed quality of life, but no results were reported. Overall, BEACOPP escalated may be more effective but also more toxic than ABVD, and long-term side effects have not been sufficiently analyzed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 15 studies involving 1835 cancer patients. We included 19 evaluations because some studies had multiple parts. We found that 6 studies had a high risk of bias and 9 had a low risk of bias. All the studies were done in high income countries and most were focused on breast or prostate cancer patients. Two studies involved teaching patients about self-care and patient education. We found that these interventions did not have a significant impact on return to work rates or quality of life. We did not find any studies on vocational interventions. One study looked at a physical training program for breast cancer patients and found that it did not improve return to work rates or quality of life. Seven studies looked at medical interventions and found that less radical approaches had similar return to work rates and quality of life outcomes as more radical treatments. Five studies looked at multidisciplinary interventions that combined physical, psycho-educational, and/or vocational components. These interventions led to higher return to work rates than usual care, but did not have a significant impact on quality of life. Overall, we found that multidisciplinary interventions can help cancer patients return to work."<|endoftext|>"We did not add any new trials to this update. We included four trials that involved over 13,000 women in labor in the UK and Ireland. Three of the trials were funded by hospitals, and one was funded by the Scottish government. Two of the trials did not declare any conflicts of interest, and the other two did not mention it. The studies were evaluated as having a low risk of bias. The results from the 2012 review remain the same. The data suggests that women who were given admission CTG had a higher chance of having a caesarean section than those who were given intermittent auscultation, but the difference was not statistically significant. There was no clear difference in instrumental vaginal birth or perinatal mortality rate between the two groups. Women who were given admission CTG had higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring and fetal blood sampling than those who were given intermittent auscultation. There were no differences in other secondary outcome measures. The review found no evidence of benefit for the use of admission CTG for low-risk women in labor and that it may increase the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. The review supports recommendations that admission CTG not be"<|endoftext|>"We reviewed 32 studies that looked at different culture media used in IVF or ICSI treatment. The studies compared different media and did not find any evidence of a difference between them. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and one of them found that Quinn's Advantage was associated with higher clinical pregnancy rates than G5 for cleavage-stage embryo transfer. However, this study was only available as an abstract and the quality of the evidence was low. None of the studies reported on the health of offspring. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low for nearly all comparisons due to imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific culture medium and that properly designed and executed randomised trials are necessary."<|endoftext|>"2847 citations were found, but only 27 articles were relevant after removing duplicates and articles reporting the same data. None of these 27 articles met the inclusion criteria, so data extraction and quality assessment were not possible. There were no randomized trials on how to communicate a breast cancer diagnosis to women, possibly due to ethical concerns. Future research should explore ethically sensitive ways to examine this topic. A review focusing on communication methods during the first consultation visit may provide more reliable evidence."<|endoftext|>"We added two new papers to our study, making a total of 17 studies with 1006 participants that met our criteria. One of the new studies had 113 participants. The intervention led to a significant reduction in chest pain reports for the first three months and this continued up to nine months. There was also an increase in chest pain-free days for up to three months. However, there was no effect on chest pain severity or frequency after three months. The therapists were not blinded to the intervention, and some participants were not allowed to be blinded due to ethical concerns. This led to a high risk of bias in the studies. The results were also highly variable, making it difficult to draw conclusions. The study suggests that psychological interventions, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy, may be beneficial for NSCP, but more research is needed with longer follow-up periods."<|endoftext|>"We found 30 trials with 4344 participants testing 17 different drugs or treatments for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. The most commonly tested drug was azelastine. The studies varied in quality and reporting, but overall had low risk of bias. The trials only looked at short-term effects, lasting one to eight weeks. One meta-analysis was done comparing olopatadine and ketotifen, which showed some evidence that antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis compared to placebo. No serious adverse events were reported. However, there is no long-term data on their effectiveness and direct comparisons between different drugs should be viewed with caution. Overall, these drugs appear to be safe and well tolerated, but there was a large variability in reported outcomes and poor quality of reporting."<|endoftext|>"Two studies met the criteria for the review, and a third is ongoing. The studies used community-based interventions tailored to Native American populations, with a total of 1505 subjects. One study found no difference in smoking rates after 42 months, while the other found a significant difference in smokeless tobacco use. Both studies had high or unclear risk of bias. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of tobacco prevention initiatives for Indigenous youth, as smoking rates are higher in this population. Rigorous trials are necessary to address the health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations."<|endoftext|>"One trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia met the inclusion criteria out of six relevant reports identified. The trial was at unclear risk of bias and had few events for most reported outcomes, resulting in imprecise results. The trial reported no maternal mortality in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion. There were no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, or markers of severe maternal morbidity between the treatment groups. Prophylactic blood transfusion reduced the risk of pain crisis compared with selective blood transfusion, but there were no differences in the occurrence of other crises or delayed blood transfusion reaction between the comparison groups. Other relevant outcomes were not reported by the trial. Evidence from one small trial of very low quality suggests that prophylactic blood transfusion to pregnant women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) confers no clear clinical benefits when compared with selective transfusion. There is currently insufficient evidence to advocate for a change in existing clinical practice and policy."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 67 clinical trials with 6197 participants, but all of them had a high risk of bias. Out of those trials, 64 provided data for our review. Most of the comparisons did not show any differences, and when there were differences, they were usually in small trials. We only summarized evidence from trials that had more than one study. The only primary outcome with evidence of a difference was the number of adverse events, which was higher with radiofrequency dissecting sealer than with the clamp-crush method. Among the secondary outcomes, we found differences in blood transfusion, blood loss, hospital stay, and operating time. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality. We could not assess transitivity assumptions and inconsistency for most analyses due to a lack of data. Network meta-analysis provided additional effect estimates for comparisons where there were no direct comparisons, but the results were not very reliable due to the paucity of data. We recommend not using radiofrequency dissecting sealer outside of clinical trials since there is low-quality evidence for increased harm without any evidence of benefits. It should also be noted that the sample size was small, and we cannot rule out considerable benefit or harm with a specific method of liver resection."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses different treatments for PPP, a skin condition. Studies have shown that systemic retinoids and oral PUVA are effective treatments, but a combination of both is even better. Using topical steroid under hydrocolloid occlusion is also helpful. Other treatments like low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics, and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful, but colchicine and topical PUVA may not be effective. However, there is no standardized way to measure improvement in PPP, so it's unclear how much these treatments actually help patients. Overall, more research is needed to determine the best treatment for PPP."<|endoftext|>"Nine trials studied the effectiveness of five loop diuretic drugs in lowering blood pressure in 460 people with high blood pressure for about 9 weeks. The best estimate of the blood pressure-lowering effect was a decrease of 8 points for systolic blood pressure and 4 points for diastolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in side effects or biochemical changes. However, the quality of evidence was low due to the limited number of studies and potential bias. No significant differences were found between the different loop diuretic drugs. The review did not provide a good estimate of the side effects associated with loop diuretics due to the short duration of the trials and lack of reporting."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 58 trials, but only 48 of them with 2849 participants were relevant to our study. These participants were randomly assigned to receive either intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation or no treatment. Most of the trials included people who were at low risk of complications and were having elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common local anaesthetic used was bupivacaine in liquid form, but there were differences in how and when it was administered. There were no deaths reported in either group, but one participant in the local anaesthetic group experienced serious complications. Some trials reported no complications, and others reported no serious adverse events. None of the trials reported on quality of life or return to normal activities. The length of hospital stay was not significantly different between the two groups, but pain scores were lower in the local anaesthetic group at four to eight hours and nine to 24 hours after the procedure. However, the clinical significance of this reduction in pain is unclear. Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of local anaesthetic instillation and its impact on important clinical outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We found 74 studies that were eligible for our review and sorted them based on the antigens they detected. Types 1 to 3 detected HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) either alone or with other antigens, while types 4 and 5 detected pLDH (from P. falciparum) either alone or with other antigens. We compared these tests to microscopy and found that Type 1 tests had 71 evaluations, Type 2 had 8 evaluations, and Type 3 had 5 evaluations. In meta-analyses, Type 1 tests had an average sensitivity and specificity of 94.8% and 95.2%, Type 2 tests had an average sensitivity and specificity of 96.0% and 95.3%, and Type 3 tests had an average sensitivity and specificity of 99.5% and 90.6%, respectively. Overall, HRP-2 tests had an average sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 95.2%, respectively. For pLDH tests verified with microscopy, Type 4 had 17 evaluations and Type 5 had 3 evaluations. In meta-analyses, Type 4 tests had an average sensitivity"<|endoftext|>"Five studies conducted in the UK tested short-term changes in consultation time for each patient. However, most studies had a high risk of bias due to non-random allocation of participants, small sample sizes, and lack of data on participants' characteristics. The evidence is uncertain whether altering appointment length increases primary care consultation length, referrals, investigations, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction. None of the studies reported on the effects of altering consultation length on resources used. There is not enough evidence to support or refute a policy of altering primary care physicians' consultation lengths. More trials are needed to focus on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness."<|endoftext|>"A search found 3952 abstracts, but only three trials met the criteria. All three were conducted in developed countries with ART-experienced participants who had virologic suppression at the start. 157 people were in the trials, mostly male. The studies had biases and some differences in baseline characteristics. No meta-analysis was done due to differences in design and follow-up. The studies did not show a significant difference in virologic suppression between high and low dose stavudine. One study showed symptomatic hyperlactatemia in the high dose group, and two studies showed a reduction in bone mineral density and limb fat, and an increase in triglycerides in the high dose group. No one stopped treatment due to adverse events. These trials cannot be generalized to ART-naive patients in developing countries where stavudine is still used. More trials are needed to determine if reducing stavudine doses is safe and effective in these settings."<|endoftext|>"In this review, ten trials with a total of 1658 participants were analyzed. Five of the trials had a low risk of bias, while the other five had a moderate risk of bias. Six of the trials used a different ventilation strategy that included recruitment manoeuvres, higher PEEP, and lower tidal volume or plateau pressure. Out of the six studies that reported mortality outcomes, five showed a decrease in ICU mortality, while the other five showed no difference in 28-day or in-hospital mortality. There was no difference in the risk of barotrauma. The trials had significant clinical heterogeneity, and the results were difficult to interpret due to the co-interventions used in the open lung ventilation strategy. The evidence was downgraded to low quality due to the potential influence of co-interventions on the outcomes. Overall, the use of recruitment manoeuvres in participants with ARDS reduced ICU mortality without increasing the risk of barotrauma, but had no effect on 28-day and hospital mortality."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 15 studies with 687 participants. The quality of the studies was poor and the sample sizes were often small. Some effects were analyzed, but not all studies showed significant differences between treatment and control. Relaxation therapy reduced the use of 'as needed' medications in two studies, and CBT showed a positive effect on quality of life in two studies. Bio-feedback therapy showed a significant difference in peak expiratory flow in two studies, but relaxation therapy did not. There was no significant improvement in depression levels following relaxation therapy. The findings between studies were conflicting due to different interventions used and deficiencies in trial design. This review was unable to draw firm conclusions about the role of psychological interventions in asthma due to the lack of adequate evidence. Larger, well-conducted and reported randomized trials are needed to determine the effects of these techniques in the treatment of asthma in adults."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 35 studies with a total of 6785 participants, focusing on the comparison between antidepressants and benzodiazepines as monotherapy. However, only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes. The evidence suggests that there is no significant difference in response rate between antidepressants and benzodiazepines, but benzodiazepines may be better in terms of dropouts due to any cause. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are better tolerated than TCAs. The studies had limitations, such as small sample sizes and lack of information on adverse effects. Clinicians should assess the possible role of antidepressants and benzodiazepines on an individual basis, based on evidence of their efficacy and tolerability. Further high-quality studies are needed to provide useful and practical data."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses various studies comparing different types of stents for patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Plastic stents were found to have a lower risk of complications but a higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction compared to surgery. Metal stents were associated with lower risk of recurrent biliary obstruction than plastic stents. One study found that metal stents were more cost-effective and improved quality of life. Only one type of plastic stent had superior outcomes compared to polyethylene stents. Endoscopic metal stents are currently the preferred option for patients with malignant distal obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic carcinoma. However, for patients with short predicted survival, the benefits of metal stents may not be realized. More research is needed to determine the best stent type for these patients."<|endoftext|>"We looked at five studies that involved 444 children getting arterial cannulations. Four studies compared using ultrasound to find the artery with using touch, and one study compared ultrasound to using sound. Some studies were not very reliable because they didn't give enough information. It was hard for the people doing the studies to not know which method they were using, which could affect the results. Only two studies talked about problems that happened. When we looked at all the studies together, we found that using ultrasound was better than other methods for getting the cannulation right on the first try and for having fewer problems like bleeding. We think that using ultrasound might be even better for younger children and for people who are really good at using it. We also found that using ultrasound made it more likely to get the cannulation right within two tries. No studies talked about damage to the tissue. We think that using ultrasound is a good idea for getting arterial cannulations because it works better and has fewer problems."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one small study with male students in the Netherlands and three studies on the general population in Canadian provinces from the 1970s and 80s. The student study found that those who watched movies with less alcohol content drank less than those who watched movies with more alcohol content. The general population studies looked at different types of advertising bans and found inconsistent results. One study found that lifting a total ban on all forms of alcohol advertising to a partial ban on spirits advertising only decreased the volume of all forms of alcohol sales, but increased beer and wine sales while decreasing spirits sales. The quality of evidence was rated as very low due to a high risk of bias and imprecision in the results. No adverse effects were reported and there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against alcohol advertising restrictions. More research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses eight studies that looked at the effects of high and low MCT formulas on infant growth. The studies found no significant difference in weight gain, length gain, or head circumference gain between the two formulas. One study found a small difference in skin fold thickness gain, but it was not statistically significant. The studies did not find any difference in formula tolerance or incidence of NEC. However, the studies were limited by small sample sizes and did not address long-term outcomes. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of MCT formulas on infant growth and development."<|endoftext|>"A small trial was conducted with 34 participants comparing transcervical amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion. The trial was considered to be at high risk of bias due to small numbers, inconsistency in reporting, and lack of information on blinding. Meta-analysis was not possible. Transcervical amnioinfusion was administered with room temperature saline at 10 mL per minute for 60 minutes, then 3 mL per minute until delivery versus no amnioinfusion. All women received intrauterine pressure catheter, acetaminophen, and antibiotics. The study did not report any information about how many babies had a low Apgar score at five minutes after birth. Women in the amnioinfusion group had a lower temperature at delivery compared to women in the control group. The majority of this review's secondary outcomes were not reported in the included study. There is insufficient evidence to fully evaluate the effectiveness of using transcervical amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis and to assess the safety of this intervention or women’s satisfaction. Larger trials are needed to confirm and extend the findings of the trial reviewed here."<|endoftext|>"Three studies were conducted with a total of 1620 participants to evaluate the Mini-Cog as a cognitive screening test. The studies reported varying levels of sensitivity and specificity for the Mini-Cog. However, due to differences in methodology and clinical factors, a meta-analysis of the results was not possible. All studies had methodological limitations that could introduce bias, particularly in participant selection. There are currently few studies on the Mini-Cog's diagnostic accuracy in community settings, and the limited number of studies and methodological limitations make it difficult to recommend its use as a cognitive screening test. More well-designed studies comparing the Mini-Cog to other brief cognitive screening tests are needed to determine its accuracy and usefulness in community-based settings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 19 studies that examined three types of amphetamines and enrolled 2521 participants. Most participants were middle-aged Caucasian males with combined type ADHD. The studies were mostly conducted in the USA and were placebo-controlled, with some also including an active comparator. The studies had short-term follow-up and were mostly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We found that amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians and patients, but did not improve retention in treatment and were associated with higher attrition due to adverse events. There were differences between the types of amphetamines for the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians. We found no evidence that amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity compared to other drug interventions. The evidence generated by this review is of low or very low quality."<|endoftext|>"We added six new studies to this review, making a total of 10 studies with 811 participants. The studies varied in quality, conditions studied, vitamin D dosage, co-interventions, and outcome measures. Only two studies reported pain outcomes for responders, while the others reported treatment group averages. Overall, there was no consistent evidence that vitamin D was more effective than placebo for chronic pain. Adverse events and withdrawals were infrequent and similar between vitamin D and placebo. The evidence now includes more studies and participants, but it is unlikely that vitamin D has a large beneficial effect on chronic pain. Further investigation is needed to determine if vitamin D can be beneficial for specific chronic painful conditions."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses 41 studies that involved over 200 practices and 48,000 patients. The studies had different interventions, participants, settings, and outcomes, and the quality of the studies was often poor. The interventions were multifaceted and targeted at health professionals, the organization of care, or both. Patient education was added to some interventions. Professional interventions improved process outcomes, but the effect on patient outcomes was unclear. Organizational interventions that improved follow-up showed a favorable effect on process outcomes. Multiple interventions that included patient education or enhanced the role of nurses had favorable effects on patient health outcomes. Multifaceted professional interventions and organizational interventions that improve regular prompted recall and review of patients can enhance diabetes management. Nurses can play an important role in patient-oriented interventions."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses five studies that looked at different types of contraceptives. The studies included a total of 1503 women, with an average of 301 participants. The studies compared different types of contraceptives, including oral contraceptives, patches, rings, and intrauterine devices. The results showed that there were no significant differences in effectiveness or continuation rates between the different methods. However, one study found that women using oral contraceptives were more likely to stop using them for personal reasons compared to those using a specific type of intrauterine device. The studies also found that different doses of the same intrauterine device did not affect its effectiveness. Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate to low, and there was not enough evidence to compare the effectiveness and continuation rates of different contraceptives in women under 25 years old."<|endoftext|>"88 trials were analyzed, including 13 new ones. Most of the trials (42) were related to immunotherapy for house mite allergy, followed by pollen allergy (27), animal dander allergy (10), and other allergens. Only 16 of the trials had adequate concealment of allocation. There was significant heterogeneity in some of the comparisons. Overall, immunotherapy led to a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and medication use, as well as an improvement in bronchial hyper-reactivity. It was necessary to treat three patients with immunotherapy to avoid one deterioration in asthma symptoms and four patients to avoid one requiring increased medication. Immunotherapy also reduced allergen-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity and had some effect on non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity, but no consistent effect on lung function. Adverse reactions were possible, with one local reaction expected for every 16 patients treated and one systemic reaction for every nine patients treated. One trial found that the benefits of immunotherapy may be comparable to inhaled steroids, but the possibility of adverse effects must be considered."<|endoftext|>"No new studies were found for this update, so the total number of studies remained at six, with 1297 patients. Five of the trials had a low risk of bias, while one had an unclear risk. Lung-protective ventilation reduced mortality at day 28 and hospital mortality. However, overall mortality was not significantly different if the control group had a plateau pressure less than or equal to 31 cm H2O. There was not enough evidence for morbidity and long-term outcomes. The combined results were difficult to interpret due to clinical heterogeneity. Mortality was reduced at day 28 and at the end of the hospital stay, but the effects on long-term mortality are unknown. Ventilation with lower tidal volumes is becoming a common treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury, so additional trials may not be carried out."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 15 studies with 1833 participants and found that none of them were of high quality. Two studies showed that it takes longer to wake up from anesthesia with isoflurane compared to propofol, but there was no difference in waking up time between sevoflurane and propofol. Propofol had a lower risk of nausea and vomiting compared to sevoflurane and isoflurane, but a higher risk of haemodynamic changes compared to sevoflurane. There was no difference in the risk of shivering or pain. Propofol was better than isoflurane in terms of brain relaxation, but there was no difference between propofol and sevoflurane. Overall, using an intravenous technique with sevoflurane is just as good as using an inhalational technique for waking up from anesthesia and adverse events. However, the evidence is of low quality and more studies are needed with proper methods of randomization and blinding."<|endoftext|>"Four trials with 15,936 hypertensive subjects, with an average age of 75.4 years and mean blood pressure of 171/86 mmHg, were analyzed. The combined results of the trials showed no significant difference between treatment and placebo in terms of incidence of dementia. There was also no benefit from treatment in terms of change in Mini Mental State Examination. However, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were significantly reduced in the trials. Adverse effects requiring discontinuation of treatment were not significantly different between treatment and placebo. Quality of life data could not be analyzed. The analysis of the studies was problematic due to many control subjects receiving antihypertensive treatment. There is no convincing evidence that blood pressure lowering in late-life prevents the development of dementia or cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients with no apparent prior cerebrovascular disease. The data analysis was also biased due to patients lost to follow-up and placebo patients receiving active treatment. A meta-analysis using individual patient data may provide more robust results."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 12 trials with 3474 patients. Most articles did not report enough data to determine bias, but this did not seem to affect the results. PTCRA did not improve patient outcomes in non-complex lesions. In complex lesions, there was no significant difference in re-stenosis rates between those who received PTCRA with PTCA and those who received PTCA alone. The effectiveness of PTCRA in in-stent re-stenosis is unclear. PTCRA did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiac events compared to angioplasty alone, but it did increase the risk of vascular spasm, perforation, and transient vessel occlusion. PTCRA may be useful in certain circumstances, such as for patients who cannot have surgery or have complex lesions."<|endoftext|>"Three studies were conducted on 333 participants with bronchiolitis. Two of the studies were conducted on participants who tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). All studies used nebulised rhDNase as a daily or twice daily dose, along with other treatments such as nebulised salbutamol, steroids, and antibiotics. The results showed that nebulised rhDNase did not improve clinical outcomes or shorten the length of hospitalisation. However, it may have a role in severe bronchiolitis complicated by atelectasis, but further studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"Two studies were included in this review, with a total of 181 participants. One study had some issues with its methodology, while the other had good methodology and a larger sample size. There was no significant difference in mortality between the groups, and only one mortality occurred overall. Only one study reported aneurysm exclusion, with one failure in the surgical group. There were no wound infections in either group, and no difference in major complication rates or bleeding complications. The percutaneous approach was faster than the cut-down femoral artery access technique. The evidence quality was moderate due to the limited number of studies and low event numbers. Further research is needed."<|endoftext|>"In two trials that met the criteria, the diaphragm was more effective than the sponge in preventing pregnancy. In the larger USA trial, the diaphragm had a termination rate of 12.8 per 100 women compared to 17.4 for the sponge. In the UK trial, the termination rate was 10.9 for the diaphragm and 24.5 for the sponge. Discontinuation rates were also higher with the sponge. Allergic reactions were more common with the sponge. No new trials have been conducted since the initial review. More trials are needed to determine the role of spermicides in preventing sexually transmitted infections and adverse effects."<|endoftext|>"Sixteen studies were found, but only six were included in the review. Three studies looked at prevention and three looked at amelioration. The studies evaluated different interventions, so a meta-analysis was not possible. Two studies looked at pharmacological interventions for preventing cognitive deficits, but only one showed significant improvement in overall cognitive function. Three studies looked at pharmacological interventions for treating cognitive deficits, and two showed improvements in cognitive function. No non-pharmacological studies were eligible for amelioration of cognitive deficits. There were limitations in the studies, but memantine and donepezil showed some evidence of helping prevent and treat cognitive deficits in adults with brain tumors who have received cranial irradiation. Further research is needed to improve the quality of evidence and to explore non-pharmacological interventions."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at two studies that had some limitations. The studies involved 26 participants between the ages of 17 and 55 who had an injury that caused altered sensation in their lip and chin areas. The studies compared low-level laser treatment to placebo laser therapy. One study partially reported patient-reported altered sensation, while the other fully reported it. The results showed some improvement in the subjective assessment of neurosensory deficit in the lip and chin areas with laser therapy compared to placebo, but the estimates were imprecise. The evidence quality was very low due to limitations in the studies. No studies reported on the effects of the intervention on pain, difficulty eating or speaking, taste, quality of life, or adverse events. More research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of different interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries, including patient-focused morbidity measures and the effects of delayed treatment."<|endoftext|>"Two trials were included in this review, but they were too different to combine their data. One trial involved women with a history of diabetes and found no significant difference between using combined oestrogen and progestogen and using placebo for preventing miscarriage, perinatal death, or preterm birth. However, using combined oestrogen and progestogen was associated with an increased risk of maternal cancer in the reproductive system. The other trial involved women who had undergone in-vitro fertilisation and found no difference in the rate of miscarriage between the combined oestrogen and progesterone group and the no treatment group. There is not enough evidence to recommend the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for preventing miscarriages, and further research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 14 studies (16 comparisons) that compared TCAs and SSRIs to a placebo for treating depression. The studies had a total of 1364 participants in the intervention groups and 919 in the placebo groups, and lasted 6-8 weeks. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were effective in treating depression in primary care. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 (median NNT 9) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 (median NNT 7). The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs and 20 to 90 for SSRIs."<|endoftext|>"No new studies were found for this update. Nine studies were included, which involved 4373 participants and 5223 attacks. These studies compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators, but none combined ibuprofen with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated attacks with single doses of medication. Ibuprofen was found to be effective in treating acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority. The higher dose of ibuprofen (400 mg) was significantly better than the lower dose (200 mg) for 2-hour headache relief. Soluble formulations of ibuprofen 400 mg were better than standard tablets for 1-hour, but not 2-hour headache relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring at the same rate as with placebo. No new studies have been found since the last review."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 43 studies with 3497 people who had dry eye. The studies were different in terms of how they diagnosed dry eye, what treatments they used, and how they measured results, so we couldn't combine the data to make a clear conclusion. We did find that one type of artificial tears (0.2% polyacrylic acid-based) was consistently better than another type (1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based) in two studies with 175 people. Other types of artificial tears had mixed results or no difference compared to placebo. We also found that artificial tears are generally safe, but some people had side effects. However, the quality of the studies was low because they had biases and didn't report enough information. We also found 18 more studies that were not published, which could affect our conclusions. Overall, we need more research to know which artificial tears work best for dry eye."<|endoftext|>"A study was conducted on 136 patients to see if keeping lamivudine in second-line regimens made a difference in virological outcomes. The study found no difference between those who kept lamivudine and those who did not. Two other small studies also found no difference in viral suppression between those on a lamivudine or emtricitabine regimen compared to those on a different regimen. There are no studies comparing boosted protease inhibitors or nucleoside backbone combinations after first-line failure on non-thymidine analog combinations. Observational studies suggest that short-term response on boosted PI-based regimens is encouraging. There is limited evidence to evaluate second-line therapies in patients with HIV who fail first-line treatment with a WHO-recommended regimen. Current recommendations are based on available resources and patient- and public-health-level considerations."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 133 studies with over 800,000 participants, testing seven different airway examination tests. The tests had varying levels of bias and applicability concerns. The upper lip bite test had the highest sensitivity for diagnosing difficult laryngoscopy, while the modified Mallampati test had the highest sensitivity for diagnosing difficult tracheal intubation. However, all tests had relatively low sensitivities and high specificities. The standard bedside airway examination tests are not good screening tests. Future research is needed to develop tests with higher sensitivities. There are 27 studies that still need to be assessed."<|endoftext|>"63 studies with a total of 8014 participants were included in this analysis. 56 of these studies focused on infants and young children. The studies varied in their definitions of acute diarrhea and the end of the illness, as well as in their risk of bias. They were conducted in different settings and tested different organisms, dosages, and participant characteristics. No negative effects were found from the use of probiotics. Probiotics were found to reduce the duration of diarrhea, but the effect varied between studies. On average, probiotics significantly reduced the mean duration of diarrhea, diarrhea lasting ≥4 days, and stool frequency on day 2. The differences in effect size were not explained by study quality, probiotic strain, dosage, or other factors. Probiotics appear to be safe and effective when used with rehydration therapy for acute infectious diarrhea, but more research is needed to determine the best probiotic regimens for specific patient groups."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one study that compared nidotherapy-enhanced standard care with standard care alone. The study had 52 participants and lasted for 18 months. The study examined the short-term (up to six months) and medium-term (between six and 12 months) effects of nidotherapy-enhanced standard care versus standard care. Nidotherapy-enhanced standard care was better than standard care for social functioning in both the short and medium term, but the results were not statistically significant. The intervention group also had better engagement with non-inpatient services in both the short and medium term, with statistical significance evident in the short term, but not in the medium term. The intervention group had fewer people leaving the study early in the short term, but the control group had a slight advantage in the medium term. There were no statistically significant results for adverse effects/events of death. Results for mental state, service use, and economic outcomes were mixed. More research is needed to determine the benefits or harms of nidotherapy. Until then, it should be considered an experimental approach."<|endoftext|>"We found 8 studies on the use of pregabalin for fibromyalgia. 5 studies had a classic design where participants were randomly assigned to either pregabalin or a placebo for 8 to 13 weeks. Pregabalin was found to be effective in reducing pain intensity and increasing the number of participants experiencing substantial and moderate benefit. Adverse events were more common with pregabalin than placebo, but serious adverse events did not differ between the two groups. Withdrawals were more common with pregabalin than placebo, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were lower. Pregabalin is effective in reducing pain intensity for a small proportion of people with fibromyalgia and is similar to other effective medicines for fibromyalgia."<|endoftext|>"We studied one trial involving 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia at term. Six more studies are waiting for further assessment. The trial we studied compared magnesium sulphate with a placebo and had a low risk of bias. However, it did not report any of the primary outcomes we were looking for. There was no significant difference between magnesium sulphate and placebo in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes or gestational age at birth. The magnesium sulphate group had more maternal side effects, but there was no significant difference in adverse effects severe enough to stop treatment. There were no significant differences in postpartum haemorrhage or caesarean section rates between the groups. We need more high-quality studies to determine the safety and effectiveness of magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the term fetus. We also need to evaluate strategies to reduce maternal side effects during treatment."<|endoftext|>"Four studies were included in the review, two used combination therapies and two used cognitive and behavioural therapy. All studies showed a significant effect in favour of the intervention for smoking cessation. However, there is a significant health disparity for Indigenous populations who are over-represented in smoking-related morbidity and mortality. The review highlights the lack of evidence available for smoking cessation interventions specifically targeted at Indigenous populations. Although the limited evidence available suggests that these interventions can be effective, more rigorous trials are needed to address the health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 13 studies with a total of 5686 patients. In about half of the studies, we found that the blinding of participants and personnel and the blinding of outcome assessment were at high risk. However, we still included these studies in our analysis because they had a low weight in the overall results. We found that 75% of the studies had a low risk of bias in terms of selection, attrition, and reporting. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality. We analyzed studies of high-risk surgery patients and general intensive care patients separately. We found that the use of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) did not affect mortality, length of stay in the ICU or hospital, or cost for adult patients in intensive care. However, more studies are needed to determine if there are optimal PAC-guided management protocols that could result in benefits for specific patient groups in ICUs. Newer, less-invasive haemodynamic monitoring tools need to be validated against PAC prior to clinical use in critically ill patients."<|endoftext|>"Six studies involving 478 infants were analyzed. The infants were assessed using a combination of pain scales, and those who did not receive a sweet solution were compared between venepuncture and heel lance groups. The results showed that venepuncture was significantly less painful than heel lance (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.52; I2 = 0%). When a sweet solution was given, the difference remained significant (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.07). Venepuncture also resulted in fewer repeat skin punctures (typical RD -0.34, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.25; I2 = 97%), with an NNT of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). Cry characteristics favored venepuncture, but the difference was reduced with the use of sweet solutions. Overall, venepuncture is the preferred method for blood sampling in term neonates, and more well-designed studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses two small studies that looked at the effectiveness of resuturing perineal wounds after childbirth. The studies were not of high quality and only one of them measured wound healing at less than four weeks. The results showed a slight trend in favor of resuturing, but the difference was not statistically significant. The studies also looked at rates of dyspareunia (painful intercourse) and found no significant difference between the resuturing group and the control group. One study did find that more women in the resuturing group had resumed sexual intercourse by two months, but there was no significant difference by six months. The studies did not measure other outcomes such as pain, aesthetic results, breastfeeding, or maternal anxiety or depression. Overall, there is not enough evidence to support or refute the use of resuturing for perineal wounds after childbirth, and more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 18 studies with 2521 participants. Most of the studies were of poor quality. The studies compared medicinal herbs and antiviral drugs separately, so we couldn't combine the results. Only three studies showed that Chinese medicinal herbs might be effective in preventing and treating influenza. In one study, 'Ganmao' capsules were better than amantadine in reducing symptoms and speeding up recovery, but amantadine had more side effects. 'E Shu You' and ribavirin had similar effects in treating influenza and causing side effects. Ten studies reported mild side effects. Most Chinese medicinal herbs had similar effects to antiviral drugs, but few were better. No serious side effects were reported, but the studies had limitations. We need more high-quality studies with more participants and clear reporting."<|endoftext|>"We found 8 studies with 580 participants that met our criteria for this review. The studies looked at different interventions for dysfunctional catheters, including thrombolytic therapy, fibrin sheath stripping, and catheter exchange. Most studies had poor design and high risk of bias. Based on the available evidence, thrombolytic therapy may restore catheter function compared to placebo, but there is no clear optimal dose or administration method. Fibrin sheath stripping and catheter exchange are effective in restoring catheter patency, with catheter exchange being superior in terms of catheter survival. However, there is no evidence to suggest any specific intervention is superior in terms of dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events. Further research is needed to determine the most effective and appropriate technique for HD catheter dysfunction."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 17 studies with 22 different treatments (2674 patients were involved). 15 studies (20 treatments) showed results for tumor response and 11 studies (14 treatments) showed results for overall survival. 1532 women died out of 2116 who were involved in studies where a drug was added to their treatment. There was no difference in overall survival between those who received the drug and those who did not. There was also no difference in time to progression between the two groups. However, the addition of a drug did increase the likelihood of tumor response. The downside was that patients experienced more side effects like hair loss, nausea, vomiting, and low white blood cell count. In summary, adding a drug to the treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer improved tumor response but did not affect survival time or time to progression."<|endoftext|>"Ten trials with a total of 1896 patients were conducted, but there was no significant effect on inpatient mortality or mortality in the long term. However, higher quality studies showed a non-significant increase in inpatient mortality. Patients who were discharged to institutional care were reduced for the NLU, and functional status at discharge increased. There was a near significant increase in inpatient stay, but early readmissions were reduced. One study compared a NLU for the chronically critically ill with ICU care, and there was no significant difference in mortality or length of inpatient stay. Early readmissions were reduced. Costs of care on the NLU were higher for UK studies but lower for US based studies. Patients discharged from a NLU are better prepared for discharge, but it is unclear if this is simply a product of an increased length of inpatient stay. No significant adverse effects were noted, but more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed 11 studies with 414 participants. Some studies had low risk of bias, while others had unclear or high risk. Two studies found that therapeutic ultrasound may be more effective than placebo for short-term overall improvement, but caution is needed when interpreting the data. Another study found that therapeutic ultrasound plus splint may increase short-term overall improvement compared to splint alone, but may be less effective than low-level laser therapy plus splint. Differences between ultrasound regimens and other non-surgical interventions were generally small and not statistically significant. No adverse effects were reported, but more data is needed to determine safety. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of therapeutic ultrasound as a treatment with greater efficacy compared to other non-surgical interventions for CTS. More studies are needed to determine effectiveness and safety."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight studies with around 10,000 participants. The treatments used were pravastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, clofibrate, and conjugated estrogen. Overall, there was no effect on stroke recurrence, but statin therapy alone had a small benefit in reducing subsequent cerebrovascular events in those with a previous history of stroke or TIA. There was no evidence that this intervention reduced all-cause mortality or sudden death. Three statin trials showed a reduction in subsequent serious vascular events. Statin therapy in patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or TIA significantly reduces subsequent major coronary events, but only marginally reduces the risk of stroke recurrence. There is no clear evidence of beneficial effect from statins in those with previous haemorrhagic stroke, and it is unclear when to start statins after a stroke. Patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, with or without a history of established CHD, should receive statins based on the evidence of their benefit in those with a history of CHD."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at eleven campaigns that aimed to reduce smoking. The studies were different in many ways, such as how long they lasted, where they took place, and how they measured smoking behavior. Seven campaigns reported on how many people smoked, and two of them (in California and Massachusetts) showed significant decreases compared to the rest of the USA. Three other campaigns also had some positive effects. Of the seven campaigns that looked at tobacco consumption, three showed significant decreases. Of the eight campaigns that looked at quitting smoking, four had some positive effect. Overall, the evidence suggests that mass media campaigns can be effective in reducing smoking in adults, but the studies were different in quality and design. One campaign in Massachusetts showed positive results up to eight years later, and another in California showed positive results during the time it was well-funded and implemented. Six out of nine studies in communities or regions also had some positive effects. It's hard to say how much the effectiveness of the campaigns was influenced by factors like how long they lasted or what else was happening at the time. There was no clear relationship between campaign effectiveness and age, education, ethnicity, or gender."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 24 studies with 2166 participants, and 23 of them gave us data for meta-analysis. Some studies had low risk of bias, and we found that yoga can improve quality of life, reduce fatigue, and improve sleep in the short term. However, yoga did not seem to reduce depression or anxiety in the short term, and there was no medium-term effect on quality of life or fatigue. There were no serious adverse events reported. When compared to psychosocial/educational interventions, yoga can reduce depression, anxiety, and fatigue in the short term. When compared to exercise, yoga did not seem to have a significant effect on quality of life or fatigue. Overall, moderate-quality evidence supports the use of yoga as a supportive intervention for improving quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances. Very low-quality evidence suggests that yoga might be as effective as other exercise interventions."<|endoftext|>"We looked at a study of 125 people who had surgery for a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma. The study compared patients who had early post-operative imaging (within 48 hours) with those who did not. Most patients in the study had surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. The study had some limitations, but it suggested that there was little difference in survival rates between those who had early imaging and those who did not. There is not enough evidence to say which imaging schedule is best for glioma patients. More research is needed to determine the optimal timing of surveillance imaging for different types of glioma, taking into account individual factors like tumor growth rates and biomarkers. Studies of pediatric glioma patients could also inform future research on imaging strategies for adults with glioma."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies involving 161 people with schizophrenia. We only had data for two of our seven main outcomes. We measured improvement using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups in terms of improvement in global state or parkinsonism. We didn't have enough data for other outcomes like improvement in mental state, readmission, satisfaction with treatment, aggressive behavior, or cost of care. Chlorpromazine has been used for a long time to treat schizophrenia, but we don't have high-quality data comparing it to metiapine. However, it doesn't seem important to determine which drug is better, and future research on this comparison is unlikely."<|endoftext|>"In 23 studies, probiotics were not better than placebo for any outcome measured. Nitroimidazole antibiotics reduced the risk of clinical and endoscopic recurrence, but had a higher risk of serious adverse events. Mesalamine therapy and azathioprine/6MP were associated with a reduced risk of recurrence and did not have a higher risk of serious adverse events. Mesalamine had a higher risk of any endoscopic recurrence compared to azathioprine/6MP, but a lower risk of serious adverse events. There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about infliximab, budesonide, tenovil, and interleukin-10. Nitro-imidazole antibiotics, mesalamine, and immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine/6-MP or infliximab appear to be better than placebo for preventing post-operative recurrence of Crohn's disease. The cost, toxicity, and tolerability of these approaches need to be considered to determine the best approach for post-operative prophylaxis."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven trials with 825 participants. Most of the trials had a high or unclear risk of bias. The studies looked at different psychosocial interventions, including cognitive-behavioral coping skills training, twelve-step program, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, and brief motivational interviewing. There was no data for alcohol-related harm. In the first comparison, there was no significant difference between cognitive-behavioral coping skills training and twelve-step program. In the second comparison, there was no significant difference between brief intervention and treatment as usual. In the third comparison, there was no significant difference between motivational interviewing and treatment as usual or educational intervention only. In the fourth comparison, more people reduced alcohol use in the brief motivational intervention group than in the control group. In the fifth comparison, there was no significant difference between intensive motivational interviewing and motivational interviewing. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low to very low. Overall, there is not enough evidence to determine which psychosocial intervention is most effective in reducing alcohol consumption among people who use illicit drugs."<|endoftext|>"We found 23 trials with a total of 1586 participants. More than half of the participants were from unpublished studies. Quinine was compared to placebo, vitamin E, a quinine-vitamin E combination, a quinine-theophylline combination, and xylocaine injections into the gastrocnemius muscle. The most commonly used quinine dosage was 300 mg/day. No new trials were found in 2014. The quality of the trials varied, but quinine was found to significantly reduce cramp number, intensity, and days compared to placebo. Minor adverse events were more common with quinine, but there was no significant difference in major adverse events compared to placebo. Quinine was not significantly different from vitamin E, quinine-vitamin E combination, or xylocaine injections in terms of effectiveness or adverse effects. Theophylline combined with quinine was found to be more effective than quinine alone. More research is needed to determine optimal dosage and duration of quinine treatment, as well as to explore other treatments for muscle cramps."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven trials with a total of 406 people. Three trials were for women with leg cramps during pregnancy, and four trials were for people with unexplained leg cramps. Magnesium was compared to either a placebo or no treatment. For people with unexplained leg cramps, magnesium did not show a significant difference in the number, intensity, or duration of cramps compared to a placebo. There were also no significant differences in adverse events between magnesium and a placebo. For pregnant women with leg cramps, the results were conflicting, and more research is needed. There were no studies on magnesium for exercise-related or disease-related muscle cramps."<|endoftext|>"We looked at a study that compared a six-month home-based exercise program for muscle strength and cycling to usual care in 14 people with SMA. The participants were between 10 and 48 years old. The study was not completely unbiased, which could affect the results. Half of the participants did not complete the intended aerobic exercise training. The study measured function using a walking test and a motor skills test, but there was no significant difference between the exercise group and the usual care group. Muscle strength improved slightly in the exercise group. The study did not find any negative effects, but the evidence is not strong enough to make any conclusions about the benefits or risks of this type of exercise program for people with SMA type 3. More research is needed to develop exercise guidelines for this condition."<|endoftext|>"Two trials with a total of 149 participants were conducted to compare surgical and non-surgical treatments for cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy. Both trials had flaws in the way they were conducted, making their results unreliable. One trial found that surgery provided short-term pain relief and improved strength and sensation compared to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization, but there were no significant differences between groups after one year. The other trial found no significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment over three years, but many participants were lost to follow-up. The evidence for the effectiveness of surgery is of low quality and it is unclear whether the short-term benefits outweigh the long-term risks. Further research is needed to provide more reliable evidence."<|endoftext|>"Nine studies were included in this analysis, consisting of five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one controlled clinical trial (CCT), and three interrupted time series studies (ITSs). Six of the studies compared telephone consultations to normal care, with four conducted by doctors, one by a nurse, and one by a clinic clerk. Three studies compared telephone consultations by different types of healthcare workers, with two comparing nurses to doctors and one comparing health assistants to doctors or nurses. Three out of five studies found a decrease in visits to general practitioners (GPs), but two found a significant increase in return consultations. Overall, at least 50% of calls were handled by telephone advice alone. Seven studies looked at accident and emergency department visits, with six showing no difference between the groups and one, which involved nurse telephone consultation, found an increase in visits. Two studies reported deaths and found no difference between nurse telephone triage and normal care. Telephone consultation appears to reduce the number of surgery contacts and out-of-hours visits by GPs. However, there are still questions about its impact on service use, and further rigorous evaluation is needed with emphasis on service use, safety, cost, and patient satisfaction."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 84 trials with over 22,000 participants, and most of them focused on higher risk individuals or settings. We found that studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were better for assessing the long-term effects of interventions. Overall, the studies we looked at were of moderate or low quality. After four or more months, we found that motivational interviewing (MI) had a small positive effect on reducing the amount and frequency of alcohol consumption, as well as peak blood alcohol concentration. However, there was no clear effect on alcohol problems, binge drinking, or other risky behaviors related to alcohol. We also found that the duration of the MI intervention did not affect the results. We did not find any harms related to MI interventions. In conclusion, while we found some statistically significant effects, they were too small to be meaningful for policy or practice, and the quality of evidence was not strong."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 29 studies involving 2210 people with asthma who received different types of inhaler training. The studies varied in quality and had limitations in their methods. The studies were divided into three categories: face-to-face training, multimedia training, and feedback devices. The results showed that both face-to-face and multimedia training improved inhaler technique, but the effectiveness varied depending on how and when the technique was assessed. The studies did not consistently show clinical benefits for adults or children, and there was no evidence of harm. The review suggests that clinicians should regularly check their patients' inhaler technique, but it is unclear how to intervene effectively if the technique is inadequate."<|endoftext|>"Three small trials were conducted with a total of 226 participants. One trial involved patients with presumed stroke without CT verification, while the other two trials involved patients with CT-verified ICH. None of the trials had data on the primary outcome measure of death and dependency. The larger ICH trial showed no difference in death and disability between the mannitol and control groups. Case fatality was not reported in the trial of ischaemic stroke, and adverse events were either not found or not reported. The change in clinical condition was reported in two trials, and there was no significant difference between the mannitol-treated patients and controls. The trials did not prove any beneficial or harmful effects of mannitol. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the mannitol-treated and control groups, the confidence intervals for the treatment effect estimates were wide and included both clinically significant benefits and harms. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support the routine use of mannitol in acute stroke patients, and further trials are needed to confirm or refute its potential benefits."<|endoftext|>"In six trials, D-penicillamine was compared to a placebo in 425 patients. D-penicillamine showed significant benefits in all three dose ranges for measures such as tender joint counts, pain, physician's global assessments, and ESR. The higher the dose, the greater the benefit. However, patients in the moderate and high dosage groups had more adverse reactions, including renal and hematological abnormalities, leading to more withdrawals. D-penicillamine is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but has higher toxicity compared to other drugs. Its long-term effects on functional status and radiological progression are unclear."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four studies that used a Huangqi compound decoction with chemotherapy. All of the studies were of low quality and none of them reported on the primary outcome using Common Toxicity Criteria. However, the studies showed that using Huangqi compound decoctions with chemotherapy reduced nausea and vomiting and decreased the rate of leucopenia. It also increased the proportions of T-lymphocyte subsets: CD3, CD4, and CD8. There were no significant effects on Immunoglobulins G, A, or M. Although the studies had limitations, they suggest that Huangqi compound decoctions may help with chemotherapy side effects and stimulate immunocompetent cells. There was no evidence of harm from using Chinese herbs. However, more high-quality studies are needed to investigate the effects of Chinese herb decoctions, especially Astragalus spp. (like Huangqi), on chemotherapy-related side effects."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 394 titles and abstracts and nine ClinicalTrials.gov records. We found three RCTs that met our criteria. These trials included 866 participants aged four to 55 years with RP of all forms of genetic predisposition. One trial looked at vitamin A alone, one looked at DHA alone, and the third looked at DHA and vitamin A versus vitamin A alone. We couldn't tell if there was selective reporting bias because none of the RCTs had protocols available. One trial didn't specify the method for random sequence generation, so there was an unclear risk of bias. All three trials were graded as low risk of bias for all other domains. We didn't do a meta-analysis because the participants and interventions were too different across the trials. The primary outcome, mean change of visual field from baseline at one year, wasn't reported in any of the studies. No toxicity or adverse events were reported in these three trials. None of the trials showed a statistically significant benefit of vitamin supplementation on the progression of visual field loss or visual acuity loss. Two of the three trials showed statistically significant differences in ERG amplitudes among some subgroups of participants, but these results haven't been confirmed by other trials. Based on the results of three"<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies with a total of 414 people who were at risk of losing their jobs. Most of the people had inflammatory arthritis, with rheumatoid arthritis being the most common. The goal of the studies was to prevent job loss and improve work performance. This was done by evaluating work changes and providing person-directed interventions like vocational counseling, advice, or education. There were minimal interventions directly targeting the work environment, such as workplace visits or actions by an occupational physician. The duration and dose of the interventions varied. All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics. Two studies looked at job loss, and one looked at work absenteeism and work functioning. We found that the quality of evidence was very low, and there were marked differences in how the studies performed. One larger study showed a significant reduction in job loss, while the other study had uncertain results. There were no adverse effects reported in any of the studies. Overall, while further high-quality studies are needed, these strategies have the potential to be effective in preventing job loss and improving work performance in people with inflammatory arthritis."<|endoftext|>"We found three studies that included 285 newborns from three countries. The studies were good quality and showed that giving arginine to premature babies reduced their risk of developing NEC (a serious bowel condition). The number needed to treat to prevent NEC was 6. Arginine also reduced the risk of death related to NEC. There were no significant side effects. One study showed no adverse outcomes at 36 months. However, because the studies were small, we cannot recommend this practice yet. A larger study is needed to confirm these findings."<|endoftext|>"We found four well-designed studies involving 1943 participants with acute sinusitis that met our criteria. The studies compared INCS (a type of medication) to placebo or no treatment for 15 or 21 days. Participants receiving INCS were more likely to experience symptom improvement than those receiving placebo. Higher doses of INCS had a stronger effect on symptom improvement. No significant adverse events were reported. The evidence supports the use of INCS as a treatment for acute sinusitis, either alone or with antibiotics. Clinicians should consider the benefits and possible minor adverse events when prescribing therapy."<|endoftext|>"Giving preterm infants prophylactic vancomycin reduced the occurrence of neonatal sepsis caused by both total and coagulase negative staphylococcal infections. However, there was no significant difference in mortality, length of stay, or evidence of vancomycin toxicity between the treated and untreated groups. It is unclear if there is a risk of developing vancomycin-resistant organisms in the nurseries where these trials were conducted. Using low doses of prophylactic vancomycin can reduce the incidence of neonatal sepsis, but the studies' methods may have contributed to the low rate of sepsis in the treated groups. There is a theoretical concern about the development of resistant organisms, but there is not enough evidence to determine the risks. Prophylactic vancomycin has few clinically important benefits for very low birth weight infants, so routine prophylaxis should not be done currently."<|endoftext|>"This text is about studies on dressings and topical agents for healing postoperative wounds. One study found that aloe vera may delay healing, but the results are unclear due to a high number of people lost to follow-up. Another study found that using a plaster cast on an amputation stump can speed up healing compared to elastic compression. There were no significant differences in healing for other types of dressings. Gauze caused more pain for patients and was less satisfying compared to other dressings. Gauze is also associated with more nursing time compared to foam. There was no significant difference in hospital stay length except for one study that found shorter stays with plaster casts. Overall, the evidence is insufficient to determine the best dressing or topical agent for healing surgical wounds, but foam appears to be preferable for pain reduction, patient satisfaction, and nursing time."<|endoftext|>"In 2014, there were 11 trials, with 1482 women participating. Four trials looked at combined oral contraceptives (COCs), three studied a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), two looked at progestin-only pills (POPs), and two examined the etonogestrel-releasing implant. Older studies often lacked quantified results. Most trials did not report significant differences between the study arms in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth. Exceptions were seen mainly in older studies with limited information. The evidence was limited for any particular hormonal method. The quality of evidence was moderate overall and low for three of four placebo-controlled trials of COCs or POPs."<|endoftext|>"We found 10 studies from Australia, Singapore, and the USA that met our criteria. We grouped them based on how well they adjusted for certain factors. One study that adjusted for both factors found a lower rate of total casualty crashes. Three studies partially adjusted for one factor but not the other and found a slightly lower rate. One study made no adjustments and found a slightly lower rate. Two studies partially addressed one factor and found a slightly lower rate of right-angle casualty crashes. One study that addressed both factors found a slightly lower rate of total crashes. One study found a lower rate of red-light violations. Overall, red-light cameras are effective in reducing total casualty crashes, but the evidence is less clear for other types of crashes and violations. Most studies did not adjust for certain factors, which affects their accuracy. Larger and better-controlled studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"This text is discussing the results of four trials involving 494 participants who were given different doses of warfarin to treat blood clots. Three of the studies showed that a 10-mg dose was more effective in achieving a therapeutic INR by day five, but there was a lot of variation between the studies. One study showed that a 10-mg dose was more effective for outpatients with blood clots, while another study showed that a 5-mg dose was more effective. There was no difference in the risk of recurrent blood clots or major bleeding between the different doses. However, there was some uncertainty about which dose is best due to differences in the types of participants and length of follow-up in the studies."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven trials with 555 participants. Some trials compared enhanced care models in the hospital or at home after discharge to conventional care, while others compared geriatrician-led care to orthopaedic-led care. None of the interventions were specifically designed for people with dementia. The follow-up period ranged from hospital discharge to 24 months after discharge. We found that the evidence for all outcomes was of low or very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecise effect estimates. There was limited evidence that some models of enhanced care and rehabilitation may prevent delirium and reduce hospital stay for people with dementia who have had hip fractures, but the certainty of these results is low. More research is needed to determine the best strategies for improving outcomes for this population."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 4226 titles and found seven studies with 840 participants. The studies had different participants, treatments, and results. Some studies showed a shorter hospital stay without more hospital visits. Some studies showed less anxiety in parents and better behavior in children. Some studies showed that parents were more satisfied and better able to cope, but one study showed no change in the burden of care or the children's functional status. Two studies found that home care was more expensive for service providers but saved money for families, while one study found no cost benefits. Overall, the studies did not show that home-based nursing services reduce hospital access or readmission rates, but they did show a shorter hospital stay and improved satisfaction with home-based care. More research is needed to measure health, satisfaction, service use, and long-term costs."<|endoftext|>"In 2016, more studies were added to a review of Intensive Case Management (ICM) for people with severe mental illness. The review included 7524 participants from 40 randomized controlled trials. The studies compared ICM to standard care or non-ICM. Most studies had a high risk of selective reporting and did not provide data on relapse or important improvement in mental state.

When compared to standard care, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month and the number of people leaving the trial early. There was little or no difference in reducing death by suicide or unemployment. When compared to non-ICM, there was little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month or in the average number of admissions. ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention early, but there was little or no difference in reducing death by suicide or unemployment.

The review found that ICM is effective in improving outcomes for people with severe mental illness, but its effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. ICM is particularly valuable for people with a high level of hospitalization. ICM models with high fidelity to the original team organization of the ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital.

The"<|endoftext|>"This review analyzed data from 25 trials on box model training for laparoscopic surgery. Most of the trials had a high risk of bias. The review found that box model training improved technical skills compared to no training, with shorter task completion time, lower error scores, better accuracy scores, and better composite performance scores. However, there were no significant differences in technical skill improvement between different methods of box model training. The review suggests that further well-designed trials are needed to assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills and clinical outcomes."<|endoftext|>"Two clinical trials were reviewed. In one trial, biliary lavage with hydrocortisone was compared to saline in 17 patients. Hydrocortisone caused more adverse events and did not improve cholangiography, so the trial was stopped. In the other trial, budesonide was compared to prednisone in 18 patients. Prednisone caused higher serum bilirubin levels than budesonide. No other significant effects were found for any of the treatments. There is no evidence to support or refute the use of peroral glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis. The use of corticosteroids via nasobiliary tube caused severe adverse effects."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at 11 trials comparing early versus delayed nutritional support and parenteral versus enteral nutrition. Seven trials showed that early nutritional support may lead to better survival rates, with a relative risk of 0.67. Three trials showed a relative risk of 0.75 for death or disability at the end of follow-up. Five trials reported a relative risk of 0.66 for mortality at the end of follow-up, and two trials showed a relative risk of 0.69 for death and disability. One trial compared gastric versus jejunal enteral nutrition, but no deaths occurred. Overall, the study suggests that early feeding may lead to better outcomes in terms of survival and disability, but more trials are needed to confirm this. These trials should report on both nutritional outcomes and the effect on death and disability."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 57 studies with a total of 34,390 participants. The studies showed that digital interventions can help reduce alcohol consumption by about 23 grams per week compared to no intervention. Digital interventions also led to fewer drinking days and binge drinking sessions per month. There was no significant difference in alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions. The use of certain behavior change techniques, such as goal setting and problem solving, were associated with reduced alcohol consumption. The studies did not report any adverse effects from the interventions. The use of theory in the interventions was limited and did not seem to affect their effectiveness. Overall, digital interventions may be effective in reducing alcohol consumption, but more research is needed to understand which techniques work best."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 24 studies with a total of 4233 participants. 2124 were given benzodiazepines, 1475 were given a placebo, and the remaining 634 were given other treatments. We found that the quality of the studies was poor and that there was a high risk of bias in many of them. Benzodiazepines seemed to be more effective than a placebo for treating panic disorders, but the evidence was of low quality. Benzodiazepines also had a lower dropout rate, but more participants experienced adverse effects. The studies only looked at short-term effects and did not examine long-term efficacy or risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Clinicians should consider the patient's preference and balance the benefits and harms of treatment in the long-term."<|endoftext|>"We found 13 small trials with a total of 1520 participants, and there are three ongoing trials. All studies had at least one area of uncertainty, and some were at high risk of bias for certain factors. The duration and style of tai chi varied between trials, and the participants were either healthy or had certain health conditions. No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality or non-fatal events, and there was a lot of variation between studies, making it difficult to combine them statistically. Some trials found that tai chi reduced blood pressure and improved lipid levels, but not all studies showed consistent results. Only one trial measured quality of life, and no studies reported on adverse events, costs, or type 2 diabetes. There are currently no long-term trials examining tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD, and more high-quality trials are needed to draw conclusions about its effectiveness."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses a review of 27 studies that looked at family-based interventions to prevent smoking in children and adolescents. The interventions varied in their components, target behaviors, and follow-up length. Most studies were conducted in the USA. The control groups either received no intervention or a school-based intervention. The quality of evidence was moderate due to unclear risk of bias in most studies. Family-based interventions were found to have a positive impact on preventing smoking compared to no intervention. The studies that showed the most benefit were high-intensity programs that focused on authoritative parenting. The evidence suggests that family interventions can reduce smoking uptake by 16-32%, but these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations in the data. No adverse effects were identified."<|endoftext|>"Three studies with a total of 451 participants were included in this review. Two studies compared dexamethasone to placebo, while the third study compared various interventions including metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, tropisetron, and dexamethasone. The studies lasted from seven to 14 days, and two studies with 127 participants were included in the meta-analysis for nausea intensity. The use of dexamethasone resulted in less nausea compared to placebo, but this result was not statistically significant. Adverse events were similar between groups, and the interventions were well tolerated. The evidence was of very low quality due to imprecision, selection bias, attrition bias, and the small number of participants. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing nausea and vomiting in adult cancer patients not related to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 10 studies that used antibiotics to prevent lower respiratory tract infections in high-risk children. The studies included children with HIV, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, cancer, and low birth weight neonates with respiratory disorders. The studies lasted from seven days to three years. The quality of evidence was moderate for HIV, cystic fibrosis, and cancer studies, but we couldn't rate the quality for sickle cell disease and low birth weight neonates due to inadequate data.

In HIV-infected children receiving continuous isoniazid prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Co-trimoxazole or isoniazid prophylaxis did not have a significant effect on mortality, but one study using co-trimoxazole showed a significant reduction in mortality. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis also decreased hospital admission rates. There was no evidence of increased adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis, but there was scant reporting of antibiotic resistance.

In children with cystic fibrosis receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in Pseudomonas infections. Azithromycin prophylaxis significantly reduced the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. The effect of antibiotic prophyl"<|endoftext|>"We looked at nine studies involving 519 participants that compared different gases for creating pneumoperitoneum during surgery. Nitrous oxide, helium, or room air were compared to carbon dioxide. Three studies compared nitrous oxide to carbon dioxide, but there wasn't enough evidence to determine the effects of either gas on complications or surgical morbidity. Four studies compared helium to carbon dioxide, but again, there wasn't enough evidence to determine the effects on complications or pain. One study compared room air to carbon dioxide and found that room air may decrease hospital costs and reduce pain during the first day after surgery. However, the quality of evidence is very low and the safety of these gases has not been established. More studies are needed to compare different gases with carbon dioxide and to look at outcomes such as complications, adverse events, quality of life, and pain."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 14 studies that investigated the use of dexamethasone in preterm infants. Only randomized controlled trials were included. Eight of the studies looked at the total amount of dexamethasone given, with three comparing high versus moderate doses and five comparing moderate versus low doses. The studies showed that using a moderate dose of dexamethasone increased the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes. There were no differences in outcomes between moderate and low doses. Four other studies looked at the timing of dexamethasone therapy and found no significant differences in outcomes. Two studies compared continuous versus pulse therapy and found that pulse therapy increased the risk of death or BPD. Two trials compared a standard regimen versus an individualized course of dexamethasone and found no difference in outcomes. However, the quality of evidence for all comparisons was assessed as low or very low due to small sample sizes, heterogeneity in study population and design, and lack of long-term neurodevelopmental data. Therefore, no recommendations can be made on the optimal type, dosage, or timing of dexamethasone for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants. A large, well-designed randomized"<|endoftext|>"This update did not include any new studies. The review included eight randomized controlled trials with 996 participants. The trials compared different steroidal agents to aspirin, placebo, or no treatment. Six of the trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965, one in 1990, and the final one in 2001. The results showed no significant difference in the risk of heart disease after one year between those treated with corticosteroids and those treated with aspirin. The use of prednisone did not reduce the risk of heart disease after one year. Adverse events were reported in three studies, but caution should be taken when interpreting the results due to the age of the studies and the risk of bias. The trials did not provide enough evidence to support the use of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions in patients with acute rheumatic fever. New trials are needed to assess the effects of different anti-inflammatory agents. Advances in echocardiography will allow for more precise assessments of cardiac outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies involving 12,294 participants from 79 communities. Two studies found that using insecticide spray to control flies reduced trachoma by 55% to 61% compared to doing nothing, but one study did not find it effective. One study found that providing latrines reduced trachoma by 29.5%, but this was not statistically significant and has not been confirmed by a more recent study. One study showed that health education reduced trachoma, but another study did not find the same result. Overall, there is not enough data to determine the effectiveness of environmental sanitation in controlling trachoma."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 15 studies involving 1043 people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Six studies with 373 participants compared Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to usual care, and found that CBT was significantly better at reducing fatigue symptoms. 40% of CBT participants showed clinical response compared to 26% in usual care. Four studies with 313 participants compared CBT to other psychological therapies, and found that CBT was better at reducing fatigue symptoms. However, the findings at follow-up were inconsistent. Only a few studies compared CBT to other interventions, and there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments. More studies are needed to develop effective treatment programs for people with CFS."<|endoftext|>"A study was done on 46 people with sickle cell disease, but only 39 completed the study. They were given either vitamin D or a placebo for six weeks and followed up for six months. The vitamin D group had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood and fewer pain days compared to the placebo group. However, the study had a high risk of bias and low-quality evidence, so it's not enough to guide clinical practice. More high-quality studies are needed to determine the effects and safety of vitamin D supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. Clinicians should follow existing guidelines for vitamin D and calcium intake."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at one study that compared two treatments for children aged 4 to 12 with speech difficulties. The study was funded by several organizations and involved 26 children who were randomly assigned to receive either the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3) or the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). Both treatments were delivered intensively over three weeks, and outcomes were assessed at one month and four months post-treatment. The study found that both treatments improved word accuracy, speech production consistency, and accuracy of connected speech at one month post-treatment. However, the study did not assess functional communication, and no formal analyses were conducted to compare the two treatments. The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to imprecision, and further research is needed to strengthen the evidence base for treating children with speech difficulties."<|endoftext|>"268 participants were included in four trials that administered antibiotics orally. One study in Brazil compared trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol to no treatment and was judged to have a high risk of bias. The other three studies compared antibiotics to placebo and were judged to have a mixture of low or unclear risk of bias. Antibiotics were found to reduce the risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis compared to placebo, but there is no good evidence that this leads to better visual outcomes. Further trials are needed to determine the effects of antibiotic treatment on visual outcomes for people with acute and chronic toxoplasma retinochoroiditis affecting any part of the retina."<|endoftext|>"We studied 43 trials involving mainly older people with trochanteric fractures. In 22 trials, the Gamma nail was compared to the sliding hip screw (SHS) and was found to have a higher risk of femur fracture and reoperation. However, there were no major differences in wound infection, mortality, or medical complications. In 5 trials, the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) was compared to the SHS and had more fracture fixation complications. However, both groups had similar post-operative complications, mortality, and functional outcomes. In 3 trials, the proximal femoral nail (PFN) was compared to the SHS and there were no significant differences in complications or length of hospital stay. Other nail versus extramedullary implant comparisons did not provide enough evidence to establish definite differences. Intramedullary nails may be better for subtrochanteric and some unstable trochanteric fractures, but more studies are needed. Overall, the SHS appears to be the better option for trochanteric fractures."<|endoftext|>"We found 183 references, but only 22 were potentially eligible based on their title and abstract. Only one study met our criteria and it looked at 47 women who received either surgery or Octreotide for ovarian cancer. Women with poor performance status were not included in the surgery group. Although some women who received surgery had serious complications and even died, the study found that they had better survival rates than those who received Octreotide. However, the study did not report the exact difference in survival rates or the quality of life of the patients. Overall, there is not enough evidence to determine which treatment is better for bowel obstruction in ovarian cancer, but there is some weak evidence in support of surgery."<|endoftext|>"Four studies were included in this analysis, involving 244 women with PCOS who received either 12 or 6 weeks of treatment with either simvastatin or atorvastatin. The studies found no evidence that these drugs improved menstrual regularity, ovulation rate, hirsutism, acne, or BMI, either alone or in combination with the oral contraceptive pill. However, the drugs were effective in lowering testosterone levels and improving cholesterol and triglyceride levels. No serious side effects were reported. Further research with larger sample sizes and well-designed studies is needed to assess clinical outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We found 1522 references, but excluded 1330 based on their title and abstract. We read the remaining 22 articles, but none met our criteria. We only found observational data from single-arm studies on women with cervical cancer who were treated with formalin-soaked packs, interventional radiology, or radiotherapy for palliative control of vaginal bleeding. No new studies have been found since the last review. There is no evidence from controlled trials to support or refute any of the proposed interventions compared to radiotherapy. Therefore, the choice of intervention will depend on local resources. Radiotherapy techniques are not easily available in resource-poor settings where advanced cases of cervical cancer are common. This review highlights the need for a randomized controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of palliative treatments for vaginal bleeding in women with advanced cervical cancer."<|endoftext|>"Temozolomide combined with radiotherapy is an effective primary therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) compared to radiotherapy alone. It increases overall survival and delays progression without affecting quality of life, but it does increase early adverse events. In recurrent GBM, temozolomide improves time-to-progression (TTP) and may have benefits on quality of life without increasing adverse events, but it does not improve overall survival. In the elderly, temozolomide alone is comparable to radiotherapy in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival, but with a higher instance of adverse events."<|endoftext|>"We found two studies that met our criteria. One study in Cambodia showed that private contracts with international NGOs for managing district health systems (called ""contracting-in"") may improve access to and use of healthcare. Antenatal care use increased by 28% and use of public facilities increased by 14%. However, contracting-in did not seem to improve overall population health. The other study showed that intermittent training courses over 18 months may improve the performance of district health system managers in Latin America. Managers who received the training had fewer deficiencies than those who did not. We did not find any studies on interventions for retaining district health system managers. While there is some evidence that contracting-in and intermittent training courses may be effective, more research is needed to draw firm conclusions. Other interventions, such as government regulations and professional support programs, have not been adequately studied."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies involving 123 people comparing surgical treatment to medical treatment. The methods used to keep participants and researchers unaware of the treatment group were not reported, which could introduce bias. Two studies did not describe how they concealed the randomization sequence. All three studies reported on mortality, but there was no clear evidence of a difference in mortality between the treatment groups. Six people died out of the 123 people treated, and the causes of death were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, mediastinitis, and septic shock. Surgery was associated with reductions in pneumonia, chest deformity, and tracheostomy. The duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and length of hospital stay were measured in all three studies, but the results could not be combined due to differences in reporting. Chest pain, chest tightness, bodily pain, and adverse effects were each measured in one study. The evidence from these small studies suggests that surgical treatment may be better than nonsurgical management in reducing pneumonia, chest deformity, tracheostomy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of ICU stay. However, more well-designed studies with a sufficient sample size are needed to confirm these results and detect possible surgical effects on mortality."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at the effectiveness of cerivastatin in reducing cholesterol levels in over 12,000 participants across 50 trials. The dose of cerivastatin ranged from 0.025 mg/day to 0.8 mg/day and was found to decrease LDL cholesterol by 11.0% to 40.8%, total cholesterol by 8.0% to 28.8%, and triglycerides by 9.0% to 21.4%. Cerivastatin was found to be more potent than other statins in reducing cholesterol levels. However, there was a high risk of bias for withdrawals due to adverse effects. The study did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with cerivastatin due to the short duration of the trials and lack of reporting of adverse effects in some of the trials."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 28 studies with a total of 6851 patients. Most studies had unclear to low risk of bias. Remote ischaemic preconditioning may help with continuous outcomes with negative values and dichotomous outcomes with values less than one. However, high quality evidence shows that it doesn't make much of a difference in reducing serum creatinine levels, need for dialysis, length of hospital stay, or all-cause mortality compared to control. Remote ischaemic preconditioning may slightly improve the incidence of acute kidney injury. Remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation seems safe and doesn't have many adverse effects. Overall, the available data doesn't confirm the effectiveness of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing renal ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major cardiac and vascular surgery where renal ischaemia reperfusion injury may occur."<|endoftext|>"We found 12,490 sources, read 58 studies, and chose 12 trials with 703 participants. Eight trials looked at treating post-stroke fatigue (PSF), and six of those trials (using fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline, Chinese herbs, a fatigue education program, and a mindfulness-based stress reduction program) showed that the intervention groups had less severe fatigue than the control groups. However, there was significant variation between the trials. Trials that had proper allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessors did not show a significant benefit. No trial looked at preventing PSF. Four trials looked at other symptoms after stroke and did not show any benefit for PSF. There is not enough evidence to say if any intervention is effective for treating or preventing PSF after stroke. The trials so far have been small and varied, and some have had a high risk of bias. More research is needed with better study designs and larger sample sizes."<|endoftext|>"Three small studies evaluated interventions for hyperkalaemia in preterm infants, with a total of 74 infants enrolled. Only one study measured urine output and none of the studies concealed allocation to comparison groups. Two studies were not blinded to clinical staff. One study found that glucose and insulin reduced all-cause mortality, while another found that albuterol inhalation reduced intraventricular haemorrhage. No serious side effects were noted for either intervention. Other potentially effective interventions have not been studied in randomised controlled trials. No firm recommendations can be made due to the limited information from small studies of uncertain quality. The combination of insulin and glucose is preferred over rectal cation-resin treatment, and both insulin and glucose and albuterol inhalation deserve further study."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at twelve trials comparing two treatments for a certain condition. Seven trials with 623 severely affected participants found no significant difference in disability improvement between intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) after four weeks. Three studies with 75 children showed that IVIg helped recovery more than supportive care. One trial with 21 mildly affected children found that IVIg improved disability grade significantly more than supportive treatment alone. One trial with 249 participants found no significant difference between PE followed by IVIg and PE alone. Adverse events were not significantly different between the two treatments, but IVIg was more likely to be completed. One trial with 51 children found no significant difference between a standard IVIg dose given over two days or five days. Overall, moderate quality evidence suggests that IVIg started within two weeks from onset is as effective as PE in severe disease. In children, low quality evidence suggests that IVIg probably helps recovery more than supportive care alone. More research is needed for mild disease and for patients whose treatment starts more than two weeks after onset. Dose-ranging studies are also needed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 28 clinical trials with 9330 participants. In 21 of these trials, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to receive either a high or routine amount of oxygen. In trials with low risk of bias, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference in surgical site infections, respiratory insufficiency, serious adverse events, or length of stay. However, in subgroup analyses, a high amount of oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections in trials using preoperative antibiotics and those that were adequately blinded for outcome assessment. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of a high amount of oxygen during anesthesia and surgery. Further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias are needed."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at 25 trials involving 3663 children with OME. 23 of these trials (3258 children) reported on the outcomes of interest. The studies were generally considered to have low to moderate risk of bias. The evidence suggests that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have complete resolution of OME at two to three months post-randomisation than those who received control treatment. However, there is also evidence that children treated with antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash. The impact of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain and there is no evidence that oral antibiotics reduce the need for ventilation tube insertion. The study did not report on the impact of antibiotics on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. It is important to weigh the benefits of antibiotics against the risks and the emergence of bacterial resistance."<|endoftext|>"In this study, twelve different research studies were analyzed, including nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three before-and-after studies. Only one of these studies looked at both all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as endpoints. The study found that patients who followed a low protein diet (LPD) had a lower risk of ESRD or death, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.23. However, when the results of seven RCTs in patients with type 1 diabetes were combined, there was only a slight reduction in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the LPD group. For patients with type 2 diabetes, one trial showed a small improvement in the rate of decline of GFR in the protein-restricted group, while another found no significant difference between the intervention and control groups. The actual protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 g/kg/day, and one study noted malnutrition in the LPD group. There was no data on the effects of LPDs on health-related quality of life and costs. Overall, reducing protein intake may slightly slow the progression to renal failure, but more research is needed to determine the optimal level of"<|endoftext|>"We found 19 studies involving 3480 people. 12 studies were of good quality and 7 were of lower quality. For mild brain injury, providing appropriate information can lead to good recovery without additional interventions. For moderate to severe injury, formal intervention is beneficial and starting rehabilitation early leads to better outcomes. More intensive programs lead to earlier functional gains for those already in rehabilitation. A milieu-oriented model with comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation in a therapeutic environment and involving a peer group of patients is effective for severe brain injury. Different interventions are needed for different problems. Follow-up and appropriate information and advice benefit those with mild brain injury, while routine follow-up is needed for those with moderate to severe injury. Patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation benefit from access to out-patient or community-based services. Group-based rehabilitation in a therapeutic environment is effective for neuropsychological rehabilitation following severe brain injury. Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness need to be considered in the future."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed one trial involving 176 women. The trial had four groups with two factors: infant location and type of infant apparel. We combined three groups as the intervention (rooming-in) and the fourth group as the control (separate care). The primary outcome was the duration of any breastfeeding, which was reported as a median of four months with no difference found between groups. Secondary outcomes showed that the rooming-in group had a higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding on day four postpartum before discharge from the hospital. There was little evidence to support or refute the practice of rooming-in versus mother-infant separation, and further research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at eight trials with 660 participants. Most of the studies were of poor quality and had a follow-up time of less than one month. Only two trials provided data on the number of participants who died or were dependent after 28 days of treatment. These trials showed that the sanchi group had a lower rate of death and dependency than the control group. One trial also showed higher Barthel index scores in the sanchi group. Pooled analysis of seven trials suggested that sanchi might improve neurological deficit more than the control group. The total case fatality rate was less than 1%, indicating that participants probably had mild strokes. Few adverse events were reported. However, data on stroke recurrence and quality of life were limited. The review suggests that sanchi may be beneficial and safe for acute ischaemic stroke, but more well-designed trials are needed to confirm this."<|endoftext|>"Out of 14 eligible RCTs, only 7 were included. Four of these evaluated implant placement timing. Two of them compared immediate versus delayed implants in 126 patients and found no significant differences. One of them compared immediate-delayed versus delayed implants in 46 patients and found that patients in the immediate-delayed group perceived the time to functional loading as shorter, were more satisfied, and had better perimplant marginal mucosa. However, more complications occurred in the immediate-delayed group after 5 years. Another RCT compared immediate with immediately delayed implants in 16 patients for 2 years and found no differences. Three RCTs evaluated different techniques of bone grafting for implants immediately placed in extraction sockets. There is not enough reliable evidence to determine the advantages or disadvantages of immediate, immediate-delayed, or delayed implants, or whether augmentation procedures are necessary."<|endoftext|>"Two trials were conducted on MPAC. In the first trial, 36 patients were given either clioquinol or a placebo. There was no significant difference in cognition between the two groups after 36 weeks. One participant in the clioquinol group experienced neurological symptoms. In the second trial, 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia were given PBT2 or a placebo. There was no significant difference in the Neuropsychological Test Battery or memory between the two groups after 12 weeks. However, two executive function tests showed improvement in the PBT2 group. PBT2 was found to be safe and well-tolerated. The effectiveness of clioquinol is uncertain due to concerns about the study methodology. Larger trials are needed to determine the cognitive efficacy of PBT2."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed 36 studies with 2999 participants who had pulmonary hypertension from various causes. The trials lasted an average of 14 weeks, with some lasting up to 12 months. Two trials included children, and 19 trials included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class, walk further in 6MWD, and were less likely to die compared to those who received a placebo. However, there was an increased risk of adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, such as headache, gastrointestinal upset, flushing, and muscle aches. Data comparing PDE5 inhibitors to other PAH-specific therapy were limited. PDE5 inhibitors appear to have clear beneficial effects in group 1 PAH, but there is no clear benefit for pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease or chronic thromboembolic disease. Further research is required to determine which subset of patients with PH-LHD may benefit from PDE5 inhibitors. Future trials in PH-LHD should be sufficiently powered and include invasive haemodynamic data, WHO functional class, six-minute walk distance, and clinical worsening."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed 22 trials with 2193 participants who received regional anesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm, or elbow surgery. The trials were generally well-designed, but some had weaknesses in blinding and allocation concealment. Nine trials showed that double injections were better than single injections for primary anesthesia failure, especially when using neurostimulation. Nine trials also showed that multiple injections were better than single injections for primary anesthesia failure and incomplete motor block. Twelve trials showed that multiple injections were better than double injections for primary anesthesia failure and incomplete motor block. Tourniquet pain was reduced with multiple injections. There were no significant differences in secondary analgesia failure, complications, or patient discomfort. Single and double injections were faster than multiple injections, but there was no difference in time to readiness for surgery. Overall, multiple-injection techniques using nerve stimulation for axillary plexus block were more effective than either double or single-injection techniques, but more research is needed to determine safety and other outcomes."<|endoftext|>"The search found 159 citations, but only three studies met the criteria. All three studies used beclomethasone to treat mild-moderate asthma in children for 7-12 months. The studies showed that children who received beclomethasone had a significant decrease in linear growth compared to those who received a placebo or non-steroidal therapy. The average decrease was -1.54 cm per year. It is unclear if this decrease is sustained or reversible after therapy is stopped. Other inhaled steroids with less systemic effects were not studied. If inhaled steroids are needed, use the lowest effective dose and monitor growth closely."<|endoftext|>"In three trials involving 139 patients, it was found that there was no significant difference between APD and CAPD in terms of mortality, risk of peritonitis, switching to a different dialysis modality, hernias, PD fluid leaks, PD catheter removal, or hospital admissions. There was also no difference in residual renal function. However, one study found that peritonitis rates and hospitalization were lower in patients on APD when expressed as episodes per patient-year, and another study found that patients on APD had more time for work, family, and social activities. While APD may be advantageous for certain groups of patients, such as younger PD patients and those in employment or education, there is a need for a larger study comparing both modalities and looking at important clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness."<|endoftext|>"The study analyzed 37 trials with a total of 9312 patients. The trials compared different treatments for Hodgkin's lymphoma. The results showed that combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) was better than radiation therapy (RT) alone in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary malignancies (SM). CRT was also better than chemotherapy (CT) alone in terms of PFS, but not OS. However, CRT had a higher risk of SM compared to CT. The data was insufficient to compare RT to CT. External-field radiation therapy (EF-RT) was better than involved-field radiation therapy (IF-RT) in terms of PFS, but not OS or SM. CRT was found to be the best treatment for early stage Hodgkin's lymphoma, while for advanced stages, CRT was better at preventing progression/relapse, but CT alone caused less SM. RT alone had a higher overall SM risk than CRT due to the need for salvage therapy. However, caution should be taken when applying these results to current therapies due to the exclusion of many studies and limited long-term data."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 26 studies with 27 groups of treatments that included 4893 participants. Most of the studies were not controlled, but one compared two opioids. The opioids were given orally, through the skin, or through the spine. Many people stopped taking the opioids because of side effects or because they didn't help with pain. Only a small number of people showed signs of addiction. All three ways of giving the opioids helped with pain, but the amount of relief varied. We don't know if the opioids helped with quality of life or functioning. Some people had minor side effects, but serious side effects were rare."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at one trial with 212 participants who all had spinal cord injuries and pressure ulcers. The trial compared a drug called oxandrolone to a placebo (an inactive substance) and looked at whether the ulcers healed and if there were any side effects. The trial found that there was not enough evidence to say whether oxandrolone helped or hindered the healing of ulcers, and that there was a risk of non-serious side effects with the drug. The trial was of low quality and stopped early because it showed that oxandrolone did not have any benefit over the placebo. More trials are needed to determine whether anabolic steroids can be used to treat pressure ulcers."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies involving 8372 people. All of the studies had some flaws. Four studies compared email to regular mail, and two compared email to usual care. There was no difference between email and regular mail for preventive screening. There was also no difference between the groups for patient or caregiver understanding and support. The results were unclear for patient or caregiver behaviors and actions. For email versus usual care, there was no significant difference in patient health status and well-being. There was no information about healthcare professionals or harms. The evidence for using email for disease prevention and health promotion was weak and not enough to guide clinical practice. The studies available did not provide clear evidence for the outcomes of interest. Future research should use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the latest technology and consider the complexity of email as an intervention."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 11 trials involving 855 people with vertigo. Nine of the studies used a modified version of the Epley manoeuvre that included postural restrictions. The results showed that there was no difference in vertigo intensity or improvement between those who received the modified Epley manoeuvre and those who received the regular one. However, the modified version did result in a higher frequency of positive to negative Dix-Hallpike test conversions. There were no serious side effects reported, but some patients experienced minor complications like neck stiffness and dizziness. The addition of postural restrictions has a small but statistically significant effect on treatment efficacy, with a number needed to treat of 10. Mastoid oscillation and additional steps in the Epley manoeuvre did not show any benefit. Patients who have difficulty with postural restrictions can still be cured with the regular Epley manoeuvre. More studies are needed with better techniques and longer follow-up."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at four studies involving 231 participants who were randomly assigned to different treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The studies compared different types of surgery to various types and doses of steroids and antibiotics. The primary outcomes measured were symptom scores and quality of life scores, and the secondary outcomes measured were endoscopic scores and complications. The evidence was of very low quality and did not show that one treatment was better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. Further research is needed to investigate this problem."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight trials involving 709 participants, mostly from middle-income countries where zinc deficiency is a problem. Four trials compared zinc-fortified staple foods with unfortified foods, and four compared zinc-fortified staple foods with the same foods containing other nutrients but no added zinc. The trials lasted between one and nine months. Most trials had unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, but low risk of bias for blinding and attrition. Foods fortified with zinc increased serum or plasma zinc levels compared to foods without added zinc. However, there was no difference in underweight or stunting risk between participants consuming foods fortified with zinc and those consuming the same food without zinc. Adding zinc to food in combination with other micronutrients may make little or no difference to serum zinc status. The effects of fortification of foods with zinc on other outcomes are unknown, and further investigation is required."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 11 studies with 3060 participants. The studies showed that using non-steroidal antiandrogens was not as effective as medical or surgical castration for advanced prostate cancer. Non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival and increased clinical progression and treatment failure. They also increased the risk of adverse events such as breast pain and gynaecomastia, but decreased the risk of hot flashes and urinary frequency. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate. Further research is needed for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer, but not for those with metastatic prostate cancer. High-quality, randomised controlled trials with long-term follow-up should be conducted."<|endoftext|>"Eight trials were identified, but one was excluded due to unequal groups. The remaining seven trials included 600,000 women aged 39 to 74. Three of the trials did not show a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality after 13 years, while four did. Overall, the seven trials showed a reduction in breast cancer mortality. However, the outcome was unreliable due to bias in favor of screening. The trials did not find an effect on total cancer mortality or all-cause mortality. More lumpectomies and mastectomies were performed in the screened groups, as well as more radiotherapy. There was no difference in chemotherapy use. Screening may reduce breast cancer mortality by 15%, but overdiagnosis and overtreatment occur in 30% of cases. This means that for every 2000 women screened, one will avoid dying from breast cancer, but 10 healthy women will be treated unnecessarily, and over 200 women will experience psychological distress from false positive results. An evidence-based leaflet is available to help women make informed decisions about screening. Advances in treatment and awareness may have reduced the absolute effect of screening today. Recent studies show more overdiagnosis and little reduction in advanced cancers with screening."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed four studies involving 522 women. One study was excluded from formal analysis because it did not report outcomes per woman randomized. Three studies looked at 10,000 units hCG priming versus no priming, while one study looked at 20,000 units hCG versus 10,000 units hCG priming. Three studies only included women with PCOS, while the fourth study excluded them. All four studies had an unclear risk of bias in more than one of the seven domains assessed, and the quality of evidence was low due to lack of blinding and imprecision. We found no evidence of a difference in live birth rates, miscarriage rates, or clinical pregnancy rates when comparing 10,000 units hCG priming to no priming. However, our findings suggested that hCG may be associated with a reduction in clinical pregnancy rates. The study comparing 20,000 units hCG with 10,000 units hCG did not provide enough data to calculate odds ratios. No studies reported on adverse events or drug reactions. In conclusion, there is no conclusive evidence that hCG priming has an effect on live birth, pregnancy, or miscarriage rates in IVM. Further well-designed RCTs are needed to determine the role of h"<|endoftext|>"Out of 24 trials, only 16 had usable data. The results of these trials showed that neither ERT nor HRT had any effect on preventing cognitive impairment after five or four years of treatment. In fact, both treatments may even have a negative effect on cognitive function. Smaller trials did not show any evidence of benefit for either treatment on individual cognitive domains. Overall, there is no evidence to support the use of ERT or HRT for cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment. It is unclear if specific types of hormone therapy or subgroups of women may benefit from treatment. Large trials in the USA may provide more information by 2010."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two studies with 880 participants, and found one ongoing study with 80 planned participants. The studies included people with partially reversible and non-reversible COPD, with a baseline mean of 43.4 to 49.6 %pred FEV₁. Both studies lasted 12 weeks and used the same combination of inhaled medication (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily; FF/VI) versus another medication (18 mcg tiotropium; TIO). Neither study was at low risk of bias in all areas. Compared to the TIO medication, the FF/VI medication did not show a statistically significant difference in primary or secondary outcomes, including mortality, COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and total serious adverse events. However, the quality of evidence was very low, and there were limitations in the studies. Therefore, we cannot say for certain whether the FF/VI medication is better or worse than the TIO medication for treating COPD. More studies are needed to determine this."<|endoftext|>"The review analyzed two drug therapy and three talk therapy trials. The data from four short-term trials with 169 participants showed that fluoxetine was better than a placebo in reducing symptoms. Fluoxetine and clomipramine were also better than desipramine in reducing symptom severity. Two talk therapy trials also showed a significant reduction in symptoms. One talk therapy trial had a low relapse rate. These results suggest that SRIs and CBT may be helpful in treating BDD, but more studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore other treatment options."<|endoftext|>"Three studies involving 268 adults looked at cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. The studies found that using a desensitization protocol was better than a rechallenge protocol at preventing discontinuation of cotrimoxazole and reducing overall hypersensitivity. No severe reactions occurred in either protocol. Cotrimoxazole desensitization resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations and adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients with a history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity. More studies are needed for pediatric patients and in resource-poor settings. Further studies are also needed for treating opportunistic infections, adjunctive medications, and different dosing schedules for desensitization."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies involving 148 newborns and found that midazolam sedation was more effective than a placebo, but the sedation scales used were not validated for premature infants. The midazolam group had a longer stay in the NICU, and one study showed lower pain scores during midazolam infusion compared to a placebo. However, another study found a higher incidence of adverse neurological events in the midazolam group compared to the morphine group. Overall, the quality of the trials was moderate, and there is not enough evidence to recommend midazolam as a sedative for newborns in intensive care. More research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at 12 trials with 767 participants to see if antibiotics were effective in treating diarrhea caused by Salmonella bacteria. The results showed that there were no significant differences between those who received antibiotics and those who did not in terms of diarrhea, clinical failure, fever, or duration of illness. However, those who received quinolone antibiotics had a higher chance of negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week of treatment, but also had a higher chance of passing the same Salmonella serovar one month after treatment. Additionally, those who received antibiotics had more non-severe adverse drug reactions. Overall, there is no evidence that antibiotics are beneficial in treating NTS diarrhea in healthy people, but it is unclear how they may affect very young or old people, or those with severe or extraintestinal disease."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 23 studies with a total of 4192 critically ill adult participants to see how accurate IL-6 is for diagnosing sepsis. There were also 20 studies that we couldn't classify yet because they were only available as conference proceedings. The participants in the studies were different in terms of age, gender, diagnosis, location, and other factors. The prevalence of sepsis varied a lot across the studies, from 12% to 78%. We found that all the studies had a high risk of bias. We couldn't calculate a formal accuracy estimate because the data was too different between studies. However, using a fixed prevalence of sepsis and specificity, we found that IL-6 had a sensitivity of 66%. If we tested 1000 adult patients with IL-6, 330 would receive appropriate antibiotic therapy, 130 would be wrongly diagnosed with sepsis, 370 would avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy, and 170 would be undiagnosed with sepsis. However, this approach has limitations. The evidence we found has many limitations, and the 20 studies awaiting classification may change our conclusions. We need more studies with rigorous methodology to accurately assess the accuracy of IL-6 for diagnosing sepsis in"<|endoftext|>"We looked at 29 trials involving 5718 participants. Most studies had an unclear or high risk of bias, were small, and had low numbers of SSI events. The trials included people with wounds from different types of surgical procedures. Four trials compared wound dressings with no dressing, while the rest compared different types of dressings. We found very low certainty evidence that wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared to alternative options. We assessed the certainty of evidence as low or very low due to risk of bias and imprecision. We found limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring, acceptability of dressing, and ease of removal. It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI or whether any particular dressing is more effective than others. Decision makers may want to consider dressing costs and patient preference when deciding how to dress a wound following surgery."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two studies. In one study, 179 women were randomly assigned to take either selenium yeast tablets or a placebo from the first trimester until birth. Only 85 women provided outcome data. The study found that selenium had a small effect on depression scores, but it was not statistically significant. There was a high risk of bias because many women withdrew from the study. The other study involved 126 women who were at risk of postpartum depression. They were randomly assigned to take either EPA, DHA, or a placebo from 12 to 20 weeks of pregnancy until six to eight weeks after giving birth. The study found that neither EPA nor DHA prevented postpartum depression. There is not enough evidence to recommend any dietary supplement for preventing postnatal depression."<|endoftext|>"We found 11 studies: 7 looked at different infusion times (803 people), and 4 looked at different peak doses (5280 people). The studies on infusion times showed that longer infusions (6 hours or more) had a lower risk of heart failure compared to shorter infusions. The studies on peak doses did not show a significant difference in heart failure risk. All studies had some issues with bias. More research is needed, especially in children and for different types of cancer."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 37 trials with 3110 participants who had traumatic brain injuries. Nine of these trials were new since 2009 and five were previously excluded but were re-evaluated and included in the 2017 update. Two ongoing studies were found and two studies are waiting to be classified. Treatment was started immediately after admission to the hospital or after craniotomies and lasted for at least 24 hours. The studies reported data on mortality, unfavourable outcomes, and pneumonia, but the results were inconsistent and could not be combined for analysis. The studies were poorly reported and had heterogeneity in design and participant inclusion. The quality of evidence for each outcome was judged using the GRADE approach and was found to be very low for mortality and unfavourable outcomes and low for pneumonia. Despite many studies, there is no high-quality evidence that hypothermia is helpful in treating people with TBI. More research is needed to establish the effect of hypothermia for people with TBI."<|endoftext|>"We found six studies involving 519 people with depression, but they were very different in terms of what they did and who was involved. Despite some positive results, the evidence for family therapy helping with depression is limited and conflicting. There is some evidence that family therapy is better than no treatment or waiting lists, but we can't say for sure if it's effective overall. It might be better to use other psychological treatments that we know work for depression. We need more high-quality studies to compare different types of family therapy."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a review of three trials involving 206 participants with vascular dementia. All three studies were found to have a high risk of bias. When the trials were analyzed together, Duxil was found to have a significant positive effect on cognitive function measured by MMSE. However, there was no data on behavior or death at the end of treatment and follow-up. Two trials did not show an improvement in functional performance measured by ADL. Adverse events were described in detail, but there were no significant differences across the trials. The trials did not measure behavior disturbance, quality of life, or caregiver burden. Due to the low quality of the trials and possible publication bias, there is not enough evidence to support the routine use of Duxil for treating dementia. More high-quality and large-scale trials are needed to confirm or refute these results."<|endoftext|>"Seven studies with 960 participants found that the quality of the trials was generally low, with some studies at risk of bias. None of the studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment, and there was a high level of statistical variation between them, which reduces the reliability of the evidence. The studies showed that participants with drains inserted had a lower incidence of seroma formation, but there was no significant difference in infection rates between those with and without drains. Participants with drains had a longer hospital stay, but fewer postoperative seroma aspirations. There was no significant difference in the volume of seroma aspirations, incidence of lymphoedema, or incidence of haematoma. Overall, the evidence suggests that using a drain after axillary lymphadenectomy can reduce the odds of developing a seroma and the number of post-operative seroma aspirations, but this should be balanced against the longer hospital stay for those with drains."<|endoftext|>"In this study, eight different research studies were analyzed, which included a total of 390,769 participants. The studies used different methods, including prospective cohort design, case-control studies, and a randomized controlled trial. The quality of the studies was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The results of the studies on the association between flavonoids and colorectal cancer and adenomas were contradictory. There was no evidence that total flavonoid intake reduced the risk of colorectal neoplasms. The evidence for different types of flavonoids was conflicting, but two studies suggested that increased intake of Flavan-3-ols reduced the risk of both CRC and colorectal adenomas. High intake of epicatechin was also found to reduce the risk of CRC. Medium quality evidence supported that increased intake of procyanidin and phytoestrogen could reduce the incidence of CRC. However, there was no evidence to suggest that high anthocyanin intake had an inverse association with colorectal adenomas. Overall, more evidence is needed to clarify the association between flavonoids and colorectal neoplasms."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven trials with 1369 participants, but all of them had a high risk of bias. Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three used the second definition (one used both). None of the trials mentioned our primary outcomes, but for secondary outcomes, extending the treatment period to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response according to both definitions. The end of treatment response was not significantly different between the two treatment groups. The number of participants who relapsed virologically was lower in the groups that had been treated for 72 weeks using both definitions. The length of treatment did not significantly affect adherence. In the single trial that reported adverse events, no significant difference was seen between the two treatment groups. This review shows that extending the treatment period from 48 weeks to 72 weeks in HCV genotype 1 infected patients can increase the proportion of sustained virological response. However, more data is needed to recommend or reject the policy of extending the treatment period for slow responders."<|endoftext|>"Two studies with a total of 34 participants were included in this review. Both studies looked at how well EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) can determine if pancreatic cancer can be removed with surgery. The studies had low concerns about their accuracy. One study had a low risk of bias, while the other had an unclear or high risk of bias. On average, 60.5% of patients who were thought to have resectable cancer after a CT scan actually had unresectable cancer during surgery. The summary estimate of EUS sensitivity for unresectability was 0.87 and the summary estimate of EUS specificity for unresectability was 0.80. This means that if EUS indicated unresectability, there was an 86.9% chance that the cancer was actually unresectable, and if EUS indicated resectability, there was a 20.0% chance that the cancer was actually unresectable. There is not enough evidence to recommend routine use of EUS in people with pancreatic or periampullary cancer who are found to have resectable disease on CT scan."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 34 studies involving 2169 people with blepharitis. 20 studies included 1661 people with anterior or mixed blepharitis, and 14 studies included 508 people with posterior blepharitis. The studies had different follow-up periods, interventions, and participant conditions, so it was difficult to do a meta-analysis. Topical antibiotics helped with symptoms and eradicated bacteria for anterior blepharitis, while lid hygiene helped with both anterior and posterior blepharitis. The effectiveness of other treatments like topical steroids and oral antibiotics was unclear. There is no strong evidence for any treatment to cure chronic blepharitis, and commercial products may not be effective. More research is needed, with randomized controlled trials separating participants by condition and comparing medical interventions and commercial products with conventional lid hygiene measures. Outcomes should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales, and participants should be followed for at least one year to assess chronic outcomes properly."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one study with 23 participants, but it had a high risk of bias. The study only measured one of our secondary outcomes, which was a reduction in disease volume. There was no significant difference between the groups, and adverse effects were reported, including airway swelling in a child with severe RRP after photodynamic therapy. We don't have enough evidence from high-quality studies to determine if photodynamic therapy helps patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. We need more studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up to see if photodynamic therapy is beneficial. Future studies should also measure outcomes like respiratory function, voice quality, and quality of life."<|endoftext|>"We found 42 studies with 4220 participants. 20 studies gave accuracy data based on individual participants, with 7 providing data with and without contrast. 16 of these studies evaluated the accuracy of CDUS, but they were generally of moderate to low quality. 11 studies evaluated the accuracy of CE-CDUS, which were of better quality than the CDUS studies. Based on the bivariate model, CE-CDUS was superior to CDUS in terms of sensitivity. Seven studies provided estimates before and after administration of contrast, and sensitivity improved significantly after contrast use. Regression testing showed evidence of statistically significant effect bias related to year of publication and study quality within individual participants based CDUS studies. For ruling in endoleaks, CE-CDUS appears superior to CDUS. In an endoleak surveillance programme CE-CDUS can be introduced as a routine diagnostic modality followed by CT scan only when the ultrasound is positive to establish the type of endoleak and the subsequent therapeutic management."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven studies with 766 participants who had low back pain during labor. Four studies used intracutaneous injections, two used subcutaneous injections, and one used both. The studies were of good quality, but four of them had a high risk of bias due to small treatment groups, incomplete outcome data, and performance bias. All studies reported that sterile water reduced pain more than other treatments, but the different scales used and the lack of a normal distribution for pain intensity or relief meant that we couldn't do a meta-analysis. One study reported that more women had a significant reduction in pain with sterile water than with a placebo. There was no significant difference in rates of caesarean section, instrumental delivery, rescue analgesia, timing of delivery, or Apgar scores between sterile water and saline. Two studies reported that more women treated with sterile water would request the same analgesia in the future. No adverse events were reported other than transient pain with injection, which was worse with sterile water. However, the outcomes reported limit conclusions for clinical practice. We found little robust evidence that sterile water is effective for low back or any other labor pain. Further large, methodologically rigorous studies are needed to determine the efficacy of sterile water to relieve pain in"<|endoftext|>"This review looked at twelve trials with a total of 1932 participants. The use of glue to fix mesh in hernia repair reduced chronic pain by 37% compared to using sutures. However, when lightweight mesh was used, the reduction in chronic pain was less significant. Heavyweight mesh showed a significant benefit from using glue. There was no significant difference in hernia recurrence between the two groups. Glue was better than sutures for duration of operation, haematoma, and recovery time to daily activities. There were no significant differences in adverse events. The quality of evidence was moderate to low. Glue may be a sensible alternative to sutures for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein repair, but larger trials with longer follow-up and high quality are needed. The difference between synthetic glue and biological glue should also be assessed in the future."<|endoftext|>"We found 32 studies on technical editing and 66 surveys on reference accuracy. Only three of the studies were randomized controlled trials. A package of editorial processes applied between acceptance and publication improved readability and reporting quality in some studies, but not all. More intensive editorial processes were associated with fewer errors in abstracts and references. Providing instructions to authors improved reporting of ethics requirements and reduced errors in references in some studies, but not all. Structuring improved the quality of abstracts but made them longer. The reference accuracy studies showed that many citations and quotations in biomedical articles are inaccurate. Few studies have rigorously evaluated the effects of technical editing, but there is some evidence that it improves papers."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 15 studies involving 721 adults with cancer pain from different types of cancer. None of the studies included children. Most studies used codeine alone or with paracetamol, and some compared it to other drugs or a placebo. Most studies only looked at the effect of a single dose of medication, but a few looked at longer treatment periods. Codeine was generally better than a placebo and similar to other drugs in reducing pain. However, there were more side effects like nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The studies were small, short, and had some problems with reporting. We don't know much about the long-term effects of codeine use for cancer pain."<|endoftext|>"This is a review of 12 trials involving 563 people with sickle cell disease, mostly African-American, aged 6 to 35 years old. The trials had different interventions and assessment times, and the overall risk of bias was low to unclear. Educational programs improved patient and caregiver knowledge, but there was no evidence of an effect on the utilization of health services or other outcomes such as coping, family relationships, or quality of life. Depression showed a statistically significant decline in intervention groups. The quality of evidence was low to moderate, suggesting that further research is needed to improve our confidence in the estimates. The review recommends further controlled trials with rigorous attention to recruitment, retention, and bias reduction."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at six trials involving 2411 participants with epilepsy. Only one trial included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizures, while the other five trials only included participants with focal onset seizures. All participants were adults between 16 and 80 years old, and the treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. Two trials were judged to have low risk of bias, while four had unclear risk of bias. Participants who received brivaracetam add-on had a significantly higher chance of experiencing a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency and achieving seizure freedom compared to those who received a placebo. However, participants receiving brivaracetam were more likely to withdraw from treatment due to adverse events compared to those receiving a placebo. The studies only included adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and future research should investigate the tolerability and efficacy of brivaracetam during longer-term follow-up and in managing other types of seizures and age groups."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 38 studies, mostly from rich countries, that explored what mothers thought about vaccine information. Many of the studies focused on the MMR vaccine. Overall, parents wanted more information than they were getting and felt worried and regretful when they didn't have enough information. They wanted balanced information about the benefits and risks of vaccines, presented in a clear and simple way, and tailored to their situation. They also wanted vaccine information to be available in more places and at the right time. Parents saw health workers as an important source of information, but poor communication and negative relationships with health workers sometimes made it hard for them to make vaccination decisions. Parents found it hard to know which sources of information to trust. The amount of information parents wanted and the sources they trusted were linked to whether they accepted vaccines or not. Most of the interventions in the studies addressed at least one or two key aspects of communication, but none of them responded to negative media stories or addressed parental perceptions of health worker motives. More research is needed, especially in rural and poorer countries, to strengthen the evidence for some of the findings. Planners should consider when and where to make vaccine information available, how to provide clear and impartial information tailored to parents' needs, and how parents perceive health workers and the"<|endoftext|>"We found 10 trials with 599 participants with anorexia nervosa. Three new trials were included in addition to the seven identified in previous versions of the review. One previously identified ongoing trial was deemed ineligible, and six new ongoing trials were included. Two of the 10 trials included children. The trials tested various psychological therapies, but comparability was poor, and risks of bias were mostly evident through lack of blinded outcome assessments and incomplete data reporting. Treatment as usual (TAU) when delivered by a non-eating-disorder specialist may be less effective than focal psychodynamic therapy. However, there were no differences between cognitive analytic therapy and TAU for this outcome, nor for body mass index (BMI). There were no differences in overall dropout rates between individual psychological therapies and TAU. Two trials found that non-specific specialist therapy or optimized TAU delivered by therapists with eating disorder expertise was similar in outcomes to cognitive behavior therapy. When comparing individual psychological therapies with each other, no specific treatment was consistently superior to any other specific approach. None of the trials identified any adverse effects. Insufficient power was problematic for the majority of trials. We can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents due to the"<|endoftext|>"This review looked at three studies involving 516 participants. One study was done in the USA and had two parts, with one group receiving silicone oil and the other sulfur hexafluoride gas or perfluropropane gas. The second study was international and compared heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil. The third study found that all three treatments had similar outcomes for retinal detachment. There were no major differences between silicone oil and perfluropropane gas, but sulfur hexafluoride gas had worse outcomes. Heavy silicone oil was not shown to be better than standard silicone oil. Adverse events were reported, but not for each group. All studies had good methods for randomization and allocation concealment. The choice of treatment should be individualized for each patient."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed five studies involving 1819 women and found that planned early delivery was associated with a lower risk of maternal mortality and severe morbidity, as well as a lower risk of HELLP syndrome and severe renal impairment. However, planned early delivery was also associated with a higher risk of respiratory distress syndrome and NICU admission for infants. There was no clear difference in the rate of caesarean section or duration of hospital stay for mothers and babies. The evidence was graded high for maternal mortality and morbidity, moderate for caesarean section and duration of hospital stay, and low for infant mortality and morbidity. For women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery may be beneficial, but further studies are needed to assess different types of hypertensive diseases and optimal timing of delivery. An individual patient meta-analysis would provide more information on outcomes."<|endoftext|>"Six studies with a total of 142 participants were included in this analysis. Two studies compared giving treatment three times a week to only giving treatment when needed in children with hemophilia. The results showed that giving treatment three times a week was better at preventing bleeding, especially joint bleeding. Three other studies looked at hemophilia A and found that prophylaxis (regular treatment) was better at preventing joint bleeds than a placebo or other prophylaxis regimens. One study looked at hemophilia B and found that weekly prophylaxis was better than bi-weekly prophylaxis at preventing joint bleeds. However, there were some side effects associated with prophylaxis, such as an increased risk of inhibitors and infections. Overall, there is strong evidence that prophylaxis can help preserve joint function in children with hemophilia, but more research is needed to determine the best prophylactic regimen for adult patients."<|endoftext|>"We added one new study to this update. Out of the 13 trials that met the criteria for this review, only 10 had usable data from 732 participants. The quality of the studies was not thoroughly assessed due to inadequate reporting of methodology. The interventions assessed in the studies were too different to pool data for any outcomes. Eight studies aimed to induce remission, and overall survival did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Five studies aimed to maintain remission, and in two out of three studies reporting survival, there was a substantial difference, but it was not statistically significant between treatment groups. Less aggressive treatment schedules seem to have similar effects with fewer adverse events. Recent studies show a preference for less aggressive care options for treating BL. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions is not strong due to small, underpowered studies prone to errors. We added one more trial, but our conclusions remain the same."<|endoftext|>"Two studies were conducted on 447 RhD negative women to compare the effectiveness of IM and IV administration of anti-D prophylaxis. Both studies gave the women a 1500 IU dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of pregnancy. Neither study had any cases of RhD alloimmunization. One study found that the mean anti-D IgG concentrations differed between IV and IM administration up to seven days, but were similar after two to three weeks. No women developed antibodies against the RhD antigen. The studies did not provide enough information to determine if there are any differences between IM and IV administration. The choice of administration route will depend on the available preparations, dose, and patient preferences."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses eight studies that looked at the use of ADP receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes to prevent cardiovascular disease. The studies included a total of 21,379 patients, most of whom had a history of cardiovascular disease. The studies compared ticlopidine and clopidogrel to aspirin or placebo. The trials had low risk of bias and lasted from 365 to 913 days. Only one trial had data on all-cause mortality, vascular mortality, and myocardial infarction, and it did not show any significant differences between ticlopidine and placebo. Three trials had data on stroke, but pooling the results did not show a significant reduction in stroke for ADP receptor antagonists compared to other antiplatelet drugs. There was no data on peripheral vascular disease, quality of life, adverse events, or costs specifically for patients with diabetes. The evidence for the use of ADP receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes is limited, and more trials are needed to guide clinical management."<|endoftext|>"Ten trials with a total of 191 participants were included in the review. Most trials had an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding. Non-invasive ventilation was evaluated in six trials for airway clearance and in three trials for overnight ventilatory support. Results showed that non-invasive ventilation may make airway clearance easier and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it. It also improved some lung function parameters. However, there were discrepancies in the results between the review and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between non-invasive ventilation and oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non-invasive ventilation. Adverse effects were reported in some trials. Non-invasive ventilation may be useful in addition to other airway clearance techniques and may improve gas exchange during sleep. However, the impact on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remains unclear. Long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis airway clearance and exercise."<|endoftext|>"This is an update to a review on using a breathing machine at night for people with COPD. Three new studies were added, making a total of seven studies with 245 people. The results showed no significant improvement in gas exchange, exercise tolerance, quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle strength, or sleep efficiency. The only small improvement was in walking distance, but it was not statistically significant. The review suggests that more research is needed to determine the effects of this treatment on COPD."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four studies involving 1190 women. The studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias, except for blinding. Inducing labor for suspected large babies did not increase the risk of C-section or instrumental delivery, but it did reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia and fractures. However, there was an increased risk of perineal tears and phototherapy. The accuracy of fetal weight estimates is often poor, so induction may not be necessary for many women. Induction did result in lower birth weight. More research is needed to determine the best timing for induction and improve accuracy of diagnosis."<|endoftext|>"We found 159 clinical trials, but only 56 with usable data on mortality. Most participants were women over 70 years old. Vitamin D was given for an average of 4.4 years. Vitamin D decreased mortality in all 56 trials, but different forms of vitamin D had different effects. Vitamin D3 decreased mortality, while vitamin D2, alfacalcidol, and calcitriol did not. Vitamin D3 also decreased cancer mortality, but when combined with calcium, it increased the risk of kidney stones. Alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of high calcium levels. Vitamin D3 seemed to decrease mortality in elderly people living independently or in institutional care. However, there were some weaknesses in the evidence, so more trials are needed."<|endoftext|>"Several studies were available for fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine, with a total of 296 participants for fluoxetine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine. These drugs produced modest reductions in weight and glycated hemoglobin, but had common side effects. Other drugs were also studied, but only a few showed significant weight loss. Fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine can achieve statistically significant weight loss over 12 to 57 weeks, but the long-term health benefits remain unclear. The safety of sibutramine is uncertain, and there is a lack of data on other drugs for weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at five studies with a total of 734 participants. Only one study was good quality, and the other four were poor quality. We couldn't do a meta-analysis because the studies didn't report the same outcomes. VGB and CBZ were similar in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six-month remission, but VGB was worse for time to first seizure. VGB caused more weight gain but fewer skin rashes and drowsiness compared to CBZ. We don't have enough data to say if VGB or CBZ is better for epilepsy. VGB can cause visual field defects, so it should be used with caution and the visual field should be checked often. Future studies should follow the recommendations of the International League Against Epilepsy and improve their quality."<|endoftext|>"We found four studies that met our criteria, but two of them ended early and didn't report results. The other two studies involved 600 people with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In both studies, one group got G-CSF plus plerixafor and the other group got G-CSF plus a placebo. The analysis showed no difference in mortality or adverse events between the two groups, but the plerixafor group had more successful stem cell collections. The studies didn't report on quality of life or progression-free survival. Two of the studies were conducted by the company that makes plerixafor and there were other studies that weren't published, so there may be some bias in our review."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 23 small trials involving 1806 women, with 717 receiving cones. The quality of the trials was hard to judge and the outcome measures differed, making it difficult to combine the results. Some trials reported high drop-out rates for both cone and comparison treatments. Seven trials were only published as abstracts. Cones were better than no active treatment for curing incontinence, but there was little evidence of a difference between cones and other treatments like PFMT and electrostimulation. There was not enough evidence to show that cones plus PFMT was different from cones alone or PFMT alone. Only seven trials used quality of life measures and no study looked at economic outcomes. The review suggests that cones could be offered as a treatment option for women with SUI if they find them acceptable, but larger, high-quality trials with comparable and relevant outcomes are needed to confirm this conclusion."<|endoftext|>"This text is discussing a review of eleven trials involving 2246 patients with atrial fibrillation. The trials tested different interventions such as education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education. The effect of self-monitoring plus education on TTR (a measure of anticoagulation control) was uncertain. Education had small positive effects on anxiety and depression compared to usual care. Decision aids did not have a significant effect on decision conflict. The review concludes that more trials are needed to determine the impact of interventions on anticoagulation control and the psychological implications for patients with atrial fibrillation."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a study that looked at the effectiveness of different forms of prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2a) in helping women achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours. The study included 70 randomized controlled trials with a total of 11,487 women, and seven new trials with 778 women were added in an update.

The results showed that PGE2 is probably effective in reducing the likelihood of vaginal delivery not being achieved within 24 hours, but it also increases the risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes. The caesarean section rate is probably reduced by about 10%. The overall effect on improving maternal and fetal outcomes is uncertain.

Different forms of PGE2 (tablets, gels, and pessaries) appear to be equally effective, with only small differences detected between some outcomes. PGF2a was only compared to placebo in one trial."<|endoftext|>"We found 11 studies, but only 5 with 247 infants were included. Cot-nursing and incubator care had no significant difference in body temperature, but cot-nursing had more episodes of hyperthermia. There was no significant difference in weight gain. Cot-nursing resulted in fewer infants being breastfed and fewer deaths before hospital discharge, but these results were not statistically significant. Cot-nursing with a heated water-filled mattress had similar effects to incubator care. However, cot-nursing using a space-heated room is not recommended as there is limited data available. More research is needed, especially in developing countries."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies with 146 participants. Two of the studies had a high risk of bias. The review found that both techniques were equally successful at exposing PDCs. One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain. One study reported complications, including infection and pain. We couldn't combine data for dental aesthetics, patient-reported pain and discomfort, periodontal health, and treatment time. However, individual studies found no differences between the surgical techniques. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that either technique is better for any of the outcomes. However, the evidence is of low quality, and more high-quality studies are needed. Three ongoing clinical trials may provide more certainty in these findings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies involving 244 women, but they were considered to have a high risk of bias. The prostaglandins used were not better than a placebo in reducing the rate of manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum hemorrhage, need for blood transfusion, mean blood loss, and the mean time from injection to placental removal. Side effects were similar between groups, except for shivering, which was more common in women who received prostaglandins. We don't have enough data to say whether prostaglandins are effective or safe for managing retained placenta. Larger studies are needed to confirm any potential benefits. The studies we looked at were of poor quality, so we can't make any recommendations for clinical practice. More high-quality research is needed in this area."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies involving 355 infants who received different types of CPAP treatment. Continuous distending pressure (CDP) was found to lower the risk of treatment failure and overall mortality, but increase the risk of pneumothorax. There was no difference in bronchopulmonary dysplasia or long-term outcomes. Using CDP as CPAP or CNP reduced respiratory failure and mortality, but most of the studies were done in the 1970s, so it's unclear how applicable the results are to current practice. More research is needed to determine the best way to administer CPAP treatment."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies with 157 participants and found that foam dressings do not help heal diabetic foot ulcers any better than basic wound contact dressings. Two studies comparing foam and alginate dressings showed no significant difference in ulcer healing. There was also no significant difference in healing when foam dressings were compared to hydrocolloid dressings. However, all the studies were small and had limited follow-up times. So, there is no clear evidence that foam dressings are better than other types of dressings for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes. Decision makers should consider factors like cost and wound management properties when choosing a dressing."<|endoftext|>"We found three trials that were eligible for our review. Two of the trials compared endoscopic intervention with surgical intervention and included a total of 111 participants. The surgical group had a higher proportion of participants with pain relief and improved quality of life at middle/long-term follow-up (two to five years), but not at long-term follow-up (≥ five years). There were no differences in major complications or mortality between the two groups. One trial compared surgical intervention with conservative treatment and showed that surgical intervention resulted in better pain relief and preservation of pancreatic function. However, this trial had limitations and a small number of participants. Overall, surgery seems to be better than endoscopy for pain relief in patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis and dilated pancreatic duct. More trials are needed to confirm the results of surgical intervention versus conservative treatment."<|endoftext|>"There was only one study included in this review, but it had a high risk of bias. The study looked at 857 patients who had minor skin surgery in a primary care setting. The patients were randomly assigned to either take a shower 12 hours after surgery (early bathing) or wait at least 48 hours before showering (delayed bathing). The only thing the study looked at was whether the patients developed a surgical site infection (SSI). There was no significant difference in the number of patients who developed SSIs between the two groups. However, the study was not conclusive because the confidence intervals were wide, meaning that it's possible that early bathing could increase or decrease the risk of SSIs. Therefore, more studies are needed to determine whether early or delayed post-operative showering or bathing is better for preventing wound complications."<|endoftext|>"A study was done with 35 participants comparing prednisone to no treatment. The study was not very reliable and did not report side effects in detail, but it did show that 12 out of 19 participants who took prednisone had improved Neuropathy Impairment Scale scores after 12 weeks compared to only 5 out of 16 participants who did not take prednisone. Another study with 40 participants compared daily prednisolone to monthly dexamethasone. The study was more reliable, but still limited, and showed little difference in outcomes between the two treatments. Both treatments had similar side effects, but dexamethasone may cause less sleeplessness and moon facies. While corticosteroids are commonly used, there is limited evidence to support their effectiveness and they can cause serious side effects. Further research is needed to identify factors that predict response."<|endoftext|>"Six studies with a total of 2100 participants were included in this analysis. Four of these studies, with 792 participants, were used for the main analysis. Two other studies, one with 1213 participants and another with 95 participants, were analyzed separately. The studies recruited people with asthma who were taking regular medication and excluded those with COPD or severe asthma. One study compared two types of check-ups for oral steroid tapering in severe refractory asthma. The studies could not be blinded and there was a high dropout rate in four of the six studies, which may have affected the results. The analysis found no significant difference in asthma control or quality of life between remote and face-to-face check-ups. However, there was insufficient information to determine whether remote check-ups are a safe alternative to face-to-face consultations."<|endoftext|>"Out of 16 studies, only three met the criteria and had a total of 212 participants. All three studies met at least seven out of 10 methodological criteria. The studies looked at functional ability, quality of life, and aerobic capacity, but none of the results were statistically significant. No negative effects of exercise therapy were reported. However, there is not enough evidence to suggest that exercise therapy can improve functional ability, quality of life, aerobic capacity, or pain. The studies did show that exercise does not worsen arthritis. There is a need for a standardised assessment or core set of outcome measurements for health research. The short-term effects of exercise therapy look promising, but the long-term effects are unclear."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 19 studies involving 2663 people, including outpatients, inpatients, and ICU patients. For outpatients with mild to moderate exacerbations, low-quality evidence suggests that antibiotics currently available can reduce the risk of treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation. Studies using older antibiotics not in use anymore also showed a reduction in treatment failures. However, one trial showed no effects of antibiotics on mortality, and another showed no effects on re-exacerbations. For inpatients with severe exacerbations, evidence of moderate quality does not show that currently used antibiotics statistically significantly reduced the risk of treatment failure, but the effect was statistically significant when trials included older antibiotics no longer in clinical use. Evidence of moderate quality from two trials including inpatients shows no beneficial effects of antibiotics on mortality. The only trial with ICU patients showed a large and statistically significant effect on treatment failure, mortality, and length of hospital stay. Overall, antibiotics have some effect on inpatients and outpatients, but these effects are small and inconsistent for some outcomes and absent for others. Antibiotics did not increase the risk of adverse events compared to placebo. More research is needed to identify patients who would benefit from antibiotics while avoiding downsides such as side effects, costs, and multi-resistance."<|endoftext|>"We looked at nine studies with a total of 1414 participants who were either given whole grain or lower whole grain/refined grain diets. None of the studies reported on the effect of whole grain diets on cardiovascular mortality or events. All studies looked at risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure and lipids. The studies were done on people who had not yet developed cardiovascular disease and had unclear or high risk of bias. None of the studies lasted longer than 16 weeks. Overall, there was no difference in total cholesterol between the whole grain and control groups. The quality of the evidence was low. Some studies were funded by organizations with commercial interests in cereals. There is not enough evidence to say whether whole grain diets affect cardiovascular outcomes or major risk factors. More well-designed studies with longer durations are needed."<|endoftext|>"38 studies with a total of 1896 participants were reviewed. Only one study had low risk of bias. 8 studies had high risk of selection bias due to lack of allocation concealment and over half of the studies had high risk of selective reporting bias. 3 small studies looked at rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. 2 studies showed short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis or a walking cast. 1 study found that 12 weeks of hypnosis did not reduce activity or improve other outcomes. 30 studies investigated rehabilitation interventions during the immobilisation period after surgical fixation. Using a removable type of immobilisation to enable controlled exercise significantly reduced activity limitation in 5 of the 8 studies reporting this outcome, reduced pain, and improved ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. However, it also led to a higher rate of mainly minor adverse events. During the immobilisation period after surgical fixation, commencing weight-bearing made a small improvement in ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. Evidence from one small but potentially biased study showed that neurostimulation may be beneficial in the short-term. There was little and inconclusive evidence on what type of support or immobilisation was the best. 5 studies"<|endoftext|>"Four studies were conducted, two in low-income countries. Two studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT), and two were non-randomised trials. One RCT of a home-based nursing programme showed a positive effect on knowledge and medication refills, but no effect on CD4 count and viral load. Another RCT of caregiver medication diaries showed no significant difference in missed doses between the intervention and control groups. A non-randomised trial of peer support group therapy for adolescents showed no change in self-reported adherence, but an increase in the percentage of participants with suppressed viral load. The second non-randomised trial found no difference in adherence between children on different regimens, but a greater proportion of children on the LPV/r regimen achieved virological suppression. More evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve paediatric adherence to ART."<|endoftext|>"Five studies with a total of 696 participants were included in this analysis. Participants had pain following various procedures. The study compared the effectiveness of different doses of fenoprofen, zomepirac, morphine, codeine, and placebo in providing pain relief. The results showed that a single dose of fenoprofen 200 mg was effective in providing at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours compared to placebo, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 2.3. However, there was not enough data to analyze other doses or active comparators, time to use of rescue medication, or numbers of participants needing rescue medication. There was no significant difference in adverse events between fenoprofen 200 mg and placebo. The study concludes that oral fenoprofen 200 mg is effective in treating moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, but more research is needed to assess other doses, efficacy outcomes, safety, and tolerability."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses six trials that looked at the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for treating prolapse in women. Four of the trials compared PFMT to a control group, while two trials looked at PFMT as an addition to surgery. The trials showed that PFMT can improve prolapse symptoms and severity, with greater improvement in symptoms in the PFMT group compared to the control group. Two trials found better pelvic floor muscle function in the PFMT group, and one trial showed less frequency and bother with bowel symptoms in the PFMT group. However, some trials had a risk of bias and the findings on urinary outcomes were contradictory. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PFMT in the long term, as well as the usefulness of combining PFMT with surgery. Other interventions, such as lifestyle changes, also need to be considered."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses the results of 14 trials involving 1,724 participants with various ear infections. The quality of the studies varied, but topical quinolone antibiotics were found to be more effective than no treatment or antiseptics in clearing discharge from the ear. There was no significant difference between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics without steroids at one or three weeks, but there was a positive trend in favor of quinolones at two weeks. Topical quinolones were also found to be significantly better at curing ear infections than antiseptics. The safety of these treatments was not well studied, and further research is needed to clarify their effects and potential risks."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 21 studies involving 6253 people, with 5515 people included in the analysis. The studies were done between 1974 and 2011, mostly in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Many studies did not report their methods well and had concerns about how applicable their findings were.

In 20 studies, FRS was able to distinguish schizophrenia from other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 81.4%. In seven studies, FRS distinguished schizophrenia from non-psychotic mental health disorders with a sensitivity of 61.8% and a specificity of 94.1%. In sixteen studies, FRS distinguished schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with a sensitivity of 58% and a specificity of 74.7%. Overall, FRS correctly identified people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time.

However, relying solely on FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage could lead to incorrect diagnoses in 5 to 19 out of every 100 people with FRS. Specialists may not agree with these diagnoses, and these people will still need specialist assessment and help. Additionally, FRS may not correctly diagnose around 40% of people that"<|endoftext|>"We looked at 10 studies, 5 of which were new. All of the interventions were added to regular treatment and given in primary and secondary care settings. 2003 people were in the educational interventions and 44 were in the psychological study. Some studies had problems with their methods. Our main goals were to see how participants rated their overall experience, how much their disease improved, and how their sleep and quality of life changed. No study reported on overall experience or sleep. The biggest study showed that both nurse-led and dermatologist-led interventions helped reduce disease severity and improve quality of life. It had 6 group education sessions. All interventions showed improvement in disease severity compared to the control group. The studies showed that interventions were more effective for older children. There is limited evidence that educational and psychological interventions help manage atopic eczema in children. More research is needed to see how these interventions compare to each other and to self-help."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 14 trials involving 753 participants. The evidence suggests that HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen therapy) may be more effective in achieving mucosal coverage for osteoradionecrosis (ORN) and may reduce the chance of wound breakdown following operative treatment for ORN. There is also evidence that HBOT can improve or cure radiation proctitis, surgical flaps, hemimandibulectomy, and healing of irradiated tooth sockets. However, there is no evidence of benefit for neurological tissues. The trials did not report any adverse events. Further research is needed to determine the best timing and selection of participants for HBOT, and an economic evaluation should be done."<|endoftext|>"We found 10 studies involving 2961 surgeons comparing the use of blunt needles to sharp needles during various surgeries. Blunt needles reduced the risk of glove perforations by 46% compared to sharp needles, preventing one perforation in every six operations. Blunt needles also reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69%. Although blunt needles require more force, they were still rated as acceptable in five out of six studies. The evidence is of high quality and shows that using blunt needles significantly reduces the risk of exposure to blood and bodily fluids for surgeons and their assistants during various surgeries. It is unlikely that future research will change this conclusion."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at seven studies with 422 participants comparing trifluoperazine to low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The studies were between four and 52 weeks long and had between 20 and 157 participants. The quality of reporting was poor for sequence generation, allocation procedures, and blinding. The results showed no significant difference in response to treatment or acceptability of treatment between trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics. However, trifluoperazine caused more movement disorders, incoordination, and rigor. There was not enough data on other outcomes like death, sedation, and quality of life. The quality of evidence for outcomes ranged from moderate to very low, so more studies are needed to draw conclusions about the effects of trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics."<|endoftext|>"We looked at nine studies with a total of 593 preterm infants. These studies compared feeding schedules that were either responsive or scheduled. The studies were small and had some weaknesses in their methods, such as not blinding the participants and not assessing all of them. When we analyzed the data, we found that responsive feeding resulted in slightly slower weight gain and may help infants transition from tube to oral feeding faster. However, the evidence was of low quality and did not strongly affect the length of hospitalization. None of the studies reported the views of parents, caregivers, or staff. Overall, the evidence does not strongly support responsive feeding as a way to improve outcomes for preterm infants and their families. There is some low-quality evidence that responsive feeding may help infants achieve full oral feeding earlier, but more research is needed to confirm this finding and determine if responsive feeding has other benefits."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at two studies with a total of 161 participants. The studies didn't report on death or limb loss. One study with 133 participants found that those who took folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate had a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI). The other study with 18 participants found no difference in ABI between those who took a multivitamin B supplement and those who took a placebo. No major events were reported. The review concludes that there isn't enough evidence to recommend treating hyperhomocysteinaemia in peripheral arterial disease and more studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"Two studies were conducted on dental practices with a total of 821 dentists and 4771 patients. Both studies had a high risk of bias and the overall quality of evidence was low. One study found that offering a fee-for-service payment increased clinical activity, but the study was limited to four deprived areas in Scotland. The other study compared capitation payments to fee-for-service payments and found that the capitation system resulted in later restoration of teeth and less frequent visits, but more preventive advice. However, there was not enough information on cost-effectiveness. Financial incentives can affect clinical activity, but more research is needed to understand the impact on patient outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 21 studies involving over 17,000 women and their babies. Zinc supplements slightly reduced the risk of preterm birth, but did not affect the number of low birthweight babies. There were no other significant differences between the groups. The quality of evidence was moderate for some outcomes, but low for others. The reduction in preterm birth was mainly seen in women with low income. However, it's important to focus on improving overall nutrition in impoverished areas rather than just using zinc supplements."<|endoftext|>"We looked at ten studies with 1656 participants that used probiotics along with antifungal drugs. None of these studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Probiotics helped with short-term clinical and mycological cure, and decreased relapse rate at one month. However, there was no significant effect on long-term clinical or mycological cure. Probiotics did not cause any serious side effects. We need more studies with better design and larger sample sizes to fully understand the benefits of probiotics."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven trials involving 696 participants from different countries with varying economic classifications. Six of the trials had participants that met the inclusion criteria, while the seventh only included a subgroup that met the criteria. We used the GRADE tool to assess the quality of evidence, which ranged from very low to moderate. Progestogens may reduce the risk of miscarriage compared to placebo or no treatment, with oral progestogen being more effective than vaginal progesterone. However, progestogens may have little or no effect on preterm birth. The evidence on congenital abnormalities is uncertain due to the low quality of evidence from only two small trials. Overall, progestogens are likely effective in treating threatened miscarriage."<|endoftext|>"We found 83 trials on using laser photocoagulation to treat diabetic retinopathy, but only five of them were eligible for our review. These studies compared laser treatment to no treatment or delayed treatment, and included a total of 4786 people. Four of the studies used panretinal photocoagulation with argon laser, while one used selective photocoagulation of non-perfusion areas. Three studies compared laser treatment to no treatment, and two compared it to delayed treatment. At 12 months, there was little difference in visual acuity between eyes that received laser treatment and those that did not. However, laser treatment reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months, and also reduced the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy and vitreous haemorrhage. None of the studies reported on quality of life or adverse effects. We concluded that laser photocoagulation is beneficial in treating proliferative diabetic retinopathy, but the evidence is of moderate or low quality. Future research should investigate combining laser treatment with newer treatments."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two trials with 269 participants, mostly men around 65 years old, in China and Italy. Both trials involved adults with breathing problems after upper abdominal surgery. We found that using CPAP or bilevel NPPV instead of just oxygen therapy may lower the chance of needing a breathing tube (tracheal intubation) and shorten the time spent in the ICU. However, we couldn't say for sure if it affected other complications like infections or bleeding. One trial showed that bilevel NPPV improved blood gas levels and pH. The trials didn't report on other potential problems like gastric insufflation or skin irritation. Overall, CPAP or bilevel NPPV seems like a good and safe option for treating breathing problems after upper abdominal surgery, but more high-quality studies are needed to confirm this."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four trials involving 388 women who were at an unclear to high risk of bias overall. The trials tested different agents for pain relief and used different methods to measure pain relief, so we couldn't combine the results. Three trials compared diazepam with other agents for general anesthesia, and one trial compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block. In one small trial, women receiving diazepam for forceps delivery were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with women receiving vinydan-ether. In another small trial, there was no significant difference in the number of women judging their pain relief as effective when diazepam was compared with ketamine. In the trial that compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block, women receiving spinal analgesia were significantly more likely to regard their analgesia as adequate and were less likely to report severe pain during forceps delivery. No trials reported on serious maternal adverse effects or complications, and neonatal mortality or serious morbidity. Women receiving diazepam were significantly less likely to experience vomiting. There is not enough evidence to support any particular pain relief agent or method as most effective for forceps delivery, and neonatal outcomes have not been evaluated."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 15 studies involving 1048 people with mild to moderate asthma for six months to over 23 years. Most studies were done in India, Europe, and the United States. Some studies only looked at yoga breathing, while others looked at yoga interventions that included breathing, posture, and meditation. The studies lasted from two weeks to 54 months, with most lasting no more than six months. The quality of the studies varied, with some having a low risk of bias and others having unclear or high risk. Yoga may improve quality of life, symptoms, and reduce medication usage in people with asthma, but more research is needed to confirm these effects. There were no serious adverse events reported, but more research is needed to understand the potential risks of yoga for people with asthma."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 10 trials with 249 participants who received different treatments for a muscle disease called IBM. Seven of the trials used one treatment, and three used a combination of treatments. However, many of the studies did not provide enough information about the main outcome, which was the change in muscle strength after six months. Two trials using interferon beta-1a showed no significant difference in muscle strength compared to a placebo, and one trial using methotrexate showed no effect on disease progression after 12 months. Three trials using intravenous immunoglobulin compared to a placebo could not be analyzed due to differences in the way the studies were conducted. Other trials using different treatments did not provide enough information to draw conclusions. All trials reported side effects, but only one trial analyzed them for statistical significance. Overall, the trials had limitations, and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these treatments."<|endoftext|>"We found no new trials for this update, but we included nine previous trials with 3144 participants. Linezolid was more effective than vancomycin in treating adults with infections caused by MRSA, with higher rates of clinical and microbiological cure. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between the two drugs, but linezolid had fewer incidents of red man syndrome, pruritus, and rash, while more people reported thrombocytopenia and nausea. Length of hospital stay was shorter with linezolid, and outpatient therapy with oral linezolid was less expensive than intravenous vancomycin. However, the available evidence is at high risk of bias and further well-designed, independently-funded trials are needed to confirm these findings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight studies with 512 participants and found that there were many differences in how the studies were done and what they measured. We found that there were no significant differences in postoperative mortality, overall survival, or morbidity between the two types of surgery, except for delayed gastric emptying, which was better with one type of surgery. We also found that the PPW surgery had shorter operating times, less blood loss, and fewer blood transfusions. However, the evidence for these findings was not very strong. Overall, there is not enough evidence to say which surgery is better, and more high-quality studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"This is a review of six studies involving 1862 participants that looked at the effect of calcium channel blockers on the risk of death and severe disability in patients with acute traumatic head injury. The results showed that there is still uncertainty about the effects of these drugs. However, in two of the studies that looked at a subgroup of patients with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, the drug nimodipine was found to have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of death. However, some patients in the intervention group experienced adverse reactions, so the drug may not be suitable for everyone."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four studies with a total of 3090 participants (one study used a different method). Three studies had a low risk of bias, and one had a high risk. When we compared survival rates, there was no significant difference between the group that received CPR first and delayed defibrillation and the group that received immediate defibrillation. We also found no significant difference in neurological outcome, return of spontaneous circulation, or survival at one year. There were no adverse effects associated with either treatment. However, the evidence is of low quality, so we cannot say for sure which treatment is better. We need more high-quality studies with larger sample sizes and proper subgroup analysis to determine the best approach."<|endoftext|>"Fifteen trials were found, but only three were eligible for inclusion. Ten trials with eight different comparison groups were included, but only one reported live birth rates. The conventional GnRHa long protocol resulted in significantly fewer oocytes retrieved compared to the stop protocol and GnRH antagonist protocol. The GnRHa long protocol group also used a significantly higher dose of gonadotrophins compared to the stop protocol and GnRH antagonist groups. Cancellation rates were significantly higher in the GnRHa flare up group compared to the GnRHa long protocol group. No studies reported a difference in miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates. There is not enough evidence to support any particular intervention for poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF. More high-quality studies with relevant outcomes are needed."<|endoftext|>"This update includes 21 new studies, bringing the total to 53 randomized controlled trials. Family intervention may help reduce the frequency of relapse, hospital admissions, and improve medication compliance and social impairment. However, it may not affect the tendency of individuals/families to leave care or prevent/promote suicide. The treatment effects may be overestimated due to poor methodological quality, but more data from trials implementing CONSORT guidelines would increase confidence in these findings."<|endoftext|>"Three trials with a total of 263 participants from Germany and Austria examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis in the femoropopliteal arteries using paclitaxel drug-eluting balloons. Two of the trials were sponsored by industry and used drug-eluting balloons manufactured by Eurocor and Medtronic. The trials looked at both anatomical and clinical outcomes, but there was heterogeneity in the frequency of bailout stenting deployment and the dosage of paclitaxel used. The certainty of evidence was very low for outcomes such as amputation, target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis, death, and improvement of Rutherford categories. However, the trials showed that drug-eluting balloons had better outcomes for target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis, and improvement in Rutherford category for up to 24 months compared to uncoated balloon angioplasty. There were no clear differences in death between the two treatments. More randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the role of drug-eluting technologies in managing in-stent restenosis."<|endoftext|>"This analysis looked at seven trials with 922 participants. Corticosteroids were found to reduce the occurrence of heart problems without causing serious side effects or death. They also reduced fever duration, time for laboratory results to normalize, and length of hospital stay. However, more studies are needed to determine which groups of patients benefit the most from corticosteroids. The quality of evidence was graded as high for serious adverse events, mortality, and time for laboratory results to normalize, but moderate for heart problems and duration of symptoms. The study suggests that corticosteroids should be considered for all children with KD until more research is done."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight studies with 846 participants, including women with postpartum depression, anxious or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We evaluated the studies for potential bias and found that some were at low risk of bias, while others were at high risk. Six studies compared PIP with control groups, and 19 meta-analyses were conducted on outcomes such as parental depression, parent-child interaction, infant attachment, and infant behavior. The results showed that PIP did not significantly improve parental depression compared to control groups, but it did improve infant attachment security. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality due to small sample sizes and risk of bias. There was no evidence that PIP was more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further research is needed to determine the impact of PIP on other factors such as parental mental health and parent-infant interaction."<|endoftext|>"We added one new study to our updated review, bringing the total to 11 studies with 753 participants. The evidence we found was of low quality and did not show any significant differences in Apgar scores at one or five minutes. None of the studies reported any issues with maternal desaturation. The evidence we found of very low quality showed that women who received supplementary oxygen during labor had higher oxygen saturation, oxygen pressure in the blood, and foetal umbilical arterial and venous blood oxygen pressure compared to those who did not receive oxygen. However, there was high variability in these outcomes. A subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in foetal umbilical arterial blood oxygen pressure between the two groups in low-risk studies, but high-risk studies showed a benefit for the neonatal oxygen group. Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving supplementary oxygen to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus' short-term clinical outcome as assessed by Apgar scores. However, the evidence we found was of low quality, so the results should be interpreted with caution."<|endoftext|>"We looked at twelve studies with 2196 participants, four of which were new for this 2011 update. Six groups in four trials showed that reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken. However, there was a lot of variation between the trials. Two trials showed that reminder packaging did not significantly reduce the number of patients who reported being adherent. Two trials showed that reminder packaging significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin levels, but there was a lot of variation between the trials. There was not enough data to analyze the effect of reminder packaging on other outcomes. One study found that patients with low literacy levels preferred reminder packaging. Reminder packaging may be a simple way to improve adherence for some patients, but more research is needed to improve the design and targeting of these devices."<|endoftext|>"We found 15 studies that looked at 11 different drugs for liver surgery. All of the studies had problems with their methods. None of the drugs made a big difference in death, liver failure, or problems after surgery. One drug, trimetazidine, made people leave the hospital sooner. Some drugs, like methylprednisolone, helped liver function, and others, like trimetazidine, methylprednisolone, and dextrose, helped prevent liver injury. But we can't be sure because the studies were small and had problems. These drugs should only be used in well-designed studies before being used in real life."<|endoftext|>"We included a total of 61 studies in our review, 37 from the original review and 24 new studies. Of these, 46 studies evaluated prevalence, six evaluated both prevalence and risk factors, and nine evaluated risk factors but did not meet the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of adverse renal effects varied widely, from 0% to 84%, due to differences in malignancies, treatments, outcome measures, follow-up duration, and study quality. Chronic kidney disease was reported in seven studies, with a prevalence ranging from 2.4% to 32%. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was present in 0% to 73.7% of participants in 36 studies. One study found an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction with concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides and vancomycin. Nephrectomy and high-dose ifosfamide were identified as risk factors for decreased GFR in non-eligible studies. Proteinuria was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants in 22 studies, with contradictory and incomparable risk factors identified. Hypophosphataemia and impaired tubular phosphate reabsorption were present in up to 36.8% and 62."<|endoftext|>"Two trials were conducted with a total of 182 participants using two phytomedicines, Niprisan® (also known as Nicosan®) and Ciklavit®. The Phase IIB trial showed that Niprisan® was effective in reducing severe painful sickle cell disease crises over a six-month period, but it did not affect the risk of severe complications or the level of anaemia. No serious adverse effects were reported. The single trial of Ciklavit® showed a possible benefit in reducing painful crises, but also a possible adverse effect on the level of anaemia. Further trials are needed to assess the role of Niprisan® in managing sickle cell disease, and the results of its multicentre trials are awaited. Currently, no conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of Ciklavit®. Based on the published results for Niprisan® and the limitations in data collection and analysis of both trials, phytomedicines may have a potential beneficial effect in reducing painful crises in sickle cell disease, but this needs to be further validated in future trials. More trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of phytomedicines in managing sickle cell disease."<|endoftext|>"We found 308 references and chose three studies with 1999 participants. The studies had moderate potential for bias and were reported as RCTs. Two studies compared standard treatment with PET-adapted therapy in early-stage HL patients with negative PET scans. The third study was more complex, dividing participants into favorable and unfavorable prognosis groups and randomizing them to receive PET-adapted or standard treatment. Only data from PET-negative participants have been published so far. Of the 1999 participants, only 1480 were analyzed. There were two deaths in each treatment group, and progression-free survival was shorter in the PET-adapted therapy group. Short-term adverse events were similar between the groups, but no data on long-term adverse events were reported. There is no data on overall survival, response rate, TRM, QoL, or long-term adverse events. More studies are needed to determine if PET-based treatment adaptation is beneficial for PET-positive individuals or those with advanced HL."<|endoftext|>"We found 31 trials that met the criteria. No new trials were eligible in 2014. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, only eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome. Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from levonorgestrel COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose. Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose and higher means for two-hour glucose response and insulin area under the curve (AUC). Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the levonorgestrel-COC group. Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables. In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a levonorgestrel-C"<|endoftext|>"We found that seven out of 10 studies had a low risk of bias, but there may be some issues with performance and detection bias because participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. Most studies reported blinded outcome assessment, but pain, physical function, and quality of life were self-reported by participants. One study did not provide enough data for bias evaluation. Nine high-quality studies showed that exercise reduced pain and improved physical function immediately after treatment. Quality of life did not show any benefit from exercise. Seven studies showed an increased likelihood of withdrawal from the exercise allocation, but this was not significant. Adverse events were rare and related to increased pain from the exercise program. Reduction in pain and improvement in physical function were sustained at least three to six months after treatment. Studies exclusively recruiting people with symptomatic hip OA did not show significant differences in outcomes compared to studies recruiting participants with hip or knee OA. Overall, land-based therapeutic exercise programs can reduce pain and improve physical function in people with symptomatic hip OA."<|endoftext|>"Nine high-quality studies involving 260 participants were included in this review. Six studies compared exercise therapy to no exercise therapy, while three studies compared different types of exercise therapy. The evidence strongly supports exercise therapy for improving muscle power, exercise tolerance, and mobility-related activities, and moderately supports improving mood. There was no evidence that exercise therapy improved fatigue or perception of handicap compared to no exercise therapy. Additionally, there was no evidence that one type of exercise therapy was more effective than another. No negative effects of exercise therapy were reported. This review suggests that exercise therapy can benefit patients with MS who are not experiencing an exacerbation. However, there is a need for agreement on outcome measures and for studies to control for treatment dose and type of MS."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a study that compared early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgery within 24 hours of diagnosis) to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgery after an average waiting period of 4.2 months) for the treatment of biliary colic. The study included 75 participants, with 35 in the early group and 40 in the delayed group. The study found that there were no deaths or bile duct injuries in either group, but complications developed in the delayed group during the waiting period. The proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was significantly lower in the early group (0%) compared to the delayed group (22.5%). The early group also had a shorter hospital stay and operating time. However, the study had a high risk of bias and further research is needed to confirm these findings."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 11 trials. Most of the studies had unclear bias, so the quality of evidence was lowered. Seven of the trials showed that long-term antibiotic use probably reduces the risk of SSI. Short-term antibiotics may also help, but there is not enough evidence to be sure. No negative effects were reported. The trials did not compare different antibiotics or look at other outcomes. Overall, long-term antibiotics are better than short-term for preventing SSI in orthognathic surgery."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one study with 40 babies and 42 women. The study wasn't strong enough to find any big differences between two ways of giving birth early. There were no clear benefits or problems with giving birth early at 36 weeks for babies with gastroschisis. The main things we looked at were how many babies were born by caesarean section and how many survived until they could leave the hospital. Two babies in the early birth group died before they could leave the hospital, but none in the other group. A similar number of women in both groups had caesarean sections. We also looked at other things like birth weight and whether the babies needed help breathing, but there were no big differences between the two groups. We couldn't find any information about how the mothers were affected. The babies in the early birth group were born a little earlier than the others, but we're not sure why. We can't say for sure if it's better or worse to give birth early for babies with gastroschisis because we only looked at one small study. We need more research to know for sure."<|endoftext|>"Three studies in adults were conducted using paracetamol as an add-on to established treatment with strong opioids. The studies lasted up to one week and included 122 participants who were initially randomized, with 95 completing treatment. No studies were found in children. The studies were at high risk of bias and did not report any of the primary outcomes. Pain reports indicated no difference between paracetamol and placebo when added to another treatment. There was no convincing evidence of paracetamol being different from placebo with regards to quality of life, use of rescue medication, or participant satisfaction or preference. Measures of harm were inconsistently reported and provided no clear evidence of difference. The evidence quality was very low for all outcomes, and it is not clear whether any additional analgesic benefit of paracetamol could be detected in the available studies, in view of the doses of opioids used. Therefore, there is no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol alone or in combination with opioids for the first two steps of the three-step WHO cancer pain ladder."<|endoftext|>"Out of 15 trials, 14 were conducted in China and hospitals. The quality of reporting was poor, with missing or unusable data and no clear description of allocation concealment. The results are biased. The primary outcome was usually the size of the wet patch on the pillow. Antimuscarinics were the most commonly evaluated drugs. Astemizole and diphenhydramine were more effective than placebo for 'no clinically important improvement,' but the doses of astemizole used can cause toxicity. Propantheline showed benefit over placebo, but the data were inconsistent. Oryzanol and Chinese medicine showed benefit over doxepin for 'no clinically important change.' There is not enough data to inform clinical practice confidently, and the risk of bias is high. Well-conducted randomized trials are possible, and some may be underway. Current practice outside of well-designed randomized trials should be justified."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies involving 195 people with MS. Two studies looked at breathing exercises with a device that makes it harder to breathe in, three studies looked at breathing exercises with a device that makes it harder to breathe out, and one study looked at regular breathing exercises. 18 people dropped out, but there were no serious problems reported. We combined the results of five studies (137 people) and found that breathing exercises with the device that makes it harder to breathe in did not make a significant difference in how hard people could breathe in or out, but it did improve their predicted maximum breathing capacity. Breathing exercises with the device that makes it harder to breathe out did not show any significant effects. None of the studies looked at quality of life. The quality of evidence was low because of limitations in the studies. In conclusion, breathing exercises with the device that makes it harder to breathe in may be moderately effective for improving breathing capacity in people with mild to moderate MS, but we don't know if the effects last or if they improve quality of life."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at one study that involved 38 women with 41 pregnancies, but only 26 women with 28 pregnancies were analyzed. The study compared the effects of betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) to no medication and found no significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia or bleeding. The study did not look at maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum hemorrhage, or neonatal intracranial hemorrhage. The evidence suggests that betamethasone does not reduce the risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia or bleeding in ITP during pregnancy, and there is not enough evidence to support its use. More well-designed studies are needed to determine the best treatment for ITP during pregnancy, including important outcomes such as maternal and neonatal health. Until then, betamethasone should not be used for ITP in pregnant women."<|endoftext|>"We found two studies in Iran that met our criteria. They involved 111 participants with moderate to severe keratoconus who were randomly assigned to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. The smaller study had 12-month follow-up data for all participants, while the larger study had follow-up data ranging from 6.8 to 36.4 months for 77 participants. The studies did not report any differences between the two techniques in terms of visual achievement, astigmatism, or spherical equivalent. Graft rejection was less likely to occur in DALK. However, there were methodological limitations and incomplete data analysis in both studies, so the overall quality of evidence was low. Large randomized trials are needed to determine which technique is better for treating keratoconus."<|endoftext|>"A search found over 31,000 records, but only 90 reports were eligible. 67 trials were included, with over 8,500 women participating. The number of women analyzed varied by outcome, with the largest number for haemoglobin concentration. Only 10 studies had low risk of bias. Women who received iron were less likely to be anaemic and had higher haemoglobin concentration and reduced risk of iron deficiency. There were no reports of mortality or iron-deficiency anaemia. Side effects were reported in some studies, including gastrointestinal issues, but adherence was not different between groups. Iron supplementation can improve exercise performance and reduce fatigue, but may cause gastrointestinal side effects."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at five studies involving 1,726 patients. Another ongoing trial was found but not included in this review. The combination treatment did not reduce all-cause mortality, but it did lead to longer progression-free survival. However, this result may have been influenced by one study. The evidence for overall survival was low and for progression-free survival was moderate due to study limitations. The combination treatment had higher risks of diarrhea and alopecia, but lower risks of neutropenia compared to the control group. There was no overall survival benefit of the combination treatment over irinotecan alone. Both treatments are reasonable options for advanced or metastatic CRC. More studies with larger patient groups are needed to clarify the benefit of the combination treatment."<|endoftext|>"The study found that using a transverse or oblique incision during abdominal surgery may have less impact on breathing and is less likely to cause wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. However, the data on pain is not clear and there were no significant differences in other complications or recovery times. While a transverse incision may look better, the choice of incision is ultimately up to the surgeon and the study's results should be interpreted with caution due to potential biases and differences in methodology."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed nine studies with a total of 981 participants, conducted in Europe and North America, with sample sizes ranging from 33 to 351 and mean ages between 32.0 and 43.7 years. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and four had additional sources of possible bias. MBR was found to be more effective than usual care for subacute LBP in reducing pain, disability, sick leave days, and increasing the likelihood of return-to-work. However, the effect sizes for pain and disability were low, and there were no differences between MBR and other treatments. Adverse events were not reported in any of the studies. The available evidence is mainly of low to very low quality, so more high-quality trials are needed to determine the value of MBR for clinical practice."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 18 studies with 4843 participants comparing bisphosphonate treatment to control methods. The primary outcome showed no significant difference in pain response between the two groups. Bisphosphonates may reduce skeletal-related events and disease progression, but may also increase the risk of nausea and renal adverse events. There was no clear difference in mortality or osteonecrosis of the jaw. Quality of life and pain assessment varied across studies. Future studies should use standardized assessment tools."<|endoftext|>"We found 3046 references in our search, but only five studies involving 1093 patients were included. The quality of these studies was moderate, and they were open-label because stem cell transplantation trials are usually not blinded. We found a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated FL patients who received HDT + ASCT, but this did not translate into a statistically significant overall survival (OS) advantage. There were no significant differences in terms of treatment-related mortality (TRM), secondary cancers, or adverse events between HDT + ASCT and the control arm in previously untreated patients. In patients with relapsed FL, there is evidence that HDT + ASCT is advantageous in terms of PFS and OS. Further trials are needed to determine the effect of HDT + ASCT more precisely, especially in the era of rituximab, and longer follow-up data are necessary to determine whether the PFS advantage will translate into an OS advantage in previously untreated patients with FL."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 15 studies involving 1437 people with schizophrenia who were treated with WDD. The studies had some bias, but overall, the risk of bias was low or unclear. WDD was found to improve short-term global state compared to placebo or no treatment, but there was no difference when compared to antipsychotic drugs. WDD was associated with fewer side effects than other treatments. When WDD was used with antipsychotics, it improved global and mental state and caused fewer side effects. However, there was no effect on weight gain. There was limited evidence on quality of life, hospital service use, and economics. Better studies are needed to fully test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia."<|endoftext|>"We found three new studies for this update, bringing the total to 12 studies with 799 participants. Three studies were judged to have a high risk of bias, three had a low risk, and six were unclear. None of the studies reported adverse outcomes. The review assessed six comparisons between different types of arch wires used in orthodontic treatment. The evidence is insufficient to determine whether there is a difference in alignment rate, time to alignment, pain, or root resorption between different types of arch wires, except for one comparison. Coaxial superelastic NiTi arch wires may produce greater tooth movement over 12 weeks than single-strand superelastic NiTi arch wires, and there may be no difference in pain at day 1 between multistrand stainless steel and superelastic NiTi arch wires."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at one study of 306 older people with dementia in 16 nursing homes in France. The study measured changes in behavior using three scales. The study found that four out of five scales improved in the intervention group, but the evidence is of very low quality due to bias and indirectness of the outcome measures. There were no differences in other measures between the groups. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of de-escalation techniques."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 13 studies with 1316 participants who had urinary or fecal incontinence and were in nursing homes or hospitals. Most of the studies had small sample sizes and short follow-up periods, and the overall quality of the studies was not great. We couldn't combine the data from the studies because they were too different in terms of the people involved, the skin care products used, and the outcomes measured. Nine studies compared different skin care products, two tested a structured skin care procedure, and the others looked at how often to use skin care products. Two studies showed that soap and water were not effective in preventing or treating incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). One study suggested that a skin cleanser might be better than soap and water, and another showed that a structured skin care procedure with a washcloth was more effective. Other studies suggested that using a leave-on product like a moisturizer or skin protectant might be helpful. No studies reported on whether participants were satisfied with the treatment or if there were any side effects. Overall, there isn't much high-quality evidence on how to prevent or treat IAD in adults. Using leave-on products and avoiding soap might be helpful, but more research is needed to figure out the best approach. It would"<|endoftext|>"We reviewed seven studies with a total of 333 participants. Three studies were done in hospitals, two in outpatient settings, and two were unclear. The participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. Different antivirals were used in the studies, and the length of treatment varied. The quality of evidence was very low, and the risk of bias was unclear or high. Two of the 12 outcomes showed improvement in the treatment group, but the results may not be clinically significant. The duration of lymphadenopathy was reduced by nine days in the treatment group. Viral shedding was suppressed during treatment but returned after treatment stopped. There was no significant difference between treatment and control groups for other outcomes. The effectiveness of antivirals in treating acute IM is uncertain, and decision makers should consider potential adverse events and costs. Further research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at four trials involving 2250 people who were given either insulin detemir or glargine for 24 to 52 weeks. The studies had a high risk of bias. Insulin glargine was given once a day in the evening, while insulin detemir was given once a day in the evening with the option of an extra dose in the morning in three studies, and twice a day in one study. Between 13.6% and 57.2% of patients were injecting insulin detemir twice a day by the end of the trial. There was no significant difference in glycaemic control or hypoglycaemia between the two treatments. Insulin detemir was associated with less weight gain, while treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily dose and fewer injection site reactions. There was no significant difference in the variability of glucose values between the two treatments. The study did not provide enough information to draw conclusions about quality of life, costs, or mortality. Overall, the study suggests that there is no significant difference in efficacy or safety between insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating hyperglycaemia."<|endoftext|>"The study included eight trials, six of which looked at the effects of SNS for faecal incontinence. In one trial, participants who received SNS had fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to those who received medical therapy. Adverse events were reported in some participants, including pain and tingling. In another trial, SNS was compared to percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, and again, SNS resulted in fewer episodes of faecal incontinence. Adverse events were reported in three participants. In a crossover trial, some participants preferred the 'on' period of stimulation and experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence, while others preferred the 'off' period and experienced more episodes. Adverse events were reported in four participants. In another crossover trial, participants did not experience any episodes of faecal incontinence during either the 'on' or 'off' periods. In a trial looking at SNS for constipation, one trial showed improvement in bowel movements and less abdominal pain and bloating, while another trial did not show improvement and reported many adverse events. Overall, SNS may improve continence in some patients with faecal incontinence, but more high-quality trials are needed to confirm this and assess the effects on"<|endoftext|>"This text is discussing two studies that looked at the success rates of molar bands and molar tubes in dental treatments. The studies found that molar bands had a higher success rate than molar tubes, with fewer instances of decalcification. The studies were well-designed and had low risk of bias. However, more evidence is needed to make stronger conclusions."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 66 articles published between 1988 and 2012 that met our criteria and found data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer who had EUS staging. The studies were mostly good quality, but some had biases. We analyzed the data to see how well EUS could distinguish between different stages of gastric cancer. Overall, EUS was useful in guiding physicians in locoregional staging, but there was some variation in the results between studies. EUS was not as good at distinguishing between certain stages of cancer, so physicians should be cautious when using it for those purposes. More research is needed to understand the sources of variation in EUS results."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies with 492 participants who had laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones. Some had day surgery and some stayed overnight. The studies had mostly women and people in their 40s. Only one study reported short-term deaths, but there were none in either group. Long-term deaths were not reported. Serious side effects were similar in both groups. Quality of life, pain, time to return to activity, and return to work were also similar. Hospital readmission rates and failed discharge rates were not significantly different. Day surgery is as safe as overnight stay surgery, but it doesn't seem to improve patient outcomes. The studies had some errors and more studies are needed to look at quality of life and other outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight studies with 2488 participants, which is more than the previous review. Most studies were good quality, but one was not. Two studies used a placebo and six used a low dose of capsaicin as a placebo. The results were not always reported consistently, so we couldn't analyze all the data. For postherpetic neuralgia, four studies showed that high-concentration capsaicin was better than the placebo at reducing pain. For painful HIV-neuropathy, two studies showed that high-concentration capsaicin was better than the placebo at reducing pain. For peripheral diabetic neuropathy, one study showed that high-concentration capsaicin was better than the placebo at reducing pain. One small study did not show a difference between capsaicin and placebo for pain reduction. There were some side effects, but they were not serious. High-concentration capsaicin can help with chronic pain, but more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three trials with 6343 participants, but they used different methods to measure carotid stenosis and define stroke. So, we combined the data from all three trials and re-analyzed it to make it comparable. We found that surgery increased the risk of stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis, had no significant effect in those with 30% to 49% stenosis, was beneficial in those with 50% to 69% stenosis, and highly beneficial in those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion. However, there was no benefit in participants with near-occlusions. Endarterectomy was of some benefit for participants with 50% to 69% symptomatic stenosis and highly beneficial for those with 70% to 99% stenosis without near-occlusion."<|endoftext|>"A study was conducted on the effectiveness of different surgical approaches for enterostomy placement in patients with rectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and other conditions. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) met the inclusion criteria, and the results were inconclusive for the incidence of parastomal herniation, development of ileus or stenosis, or skin irritation. Ten non-randomized studies (NRS) were also included, but the effects of different surgical approaches on parastomal herniation and stomal prolapse were uncertain. The study concludes that there is still a lack of high-quality evidence to support the ideal surgical technique of stoma formation."<|endoftext|>"We added four new trials to the review, bringing the total to 24 studies with 2126 participants. The evidence quality was very low, and we found no significant differences in relapse, hospitalization, and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. However, other psychological or psychosocial treatments showed significant advantages over supportive therapy in hospitalization rates, clinical improvement in mental state, and satisfaction of treatment for the recipient of care. There were no significant differences in primary outcomes between supportive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Limited data were available for comparing supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation, and no studies provided data on clinically important change in general functioning. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to identify a difference in outcome between supportive therapy and standard care. Future research should focus on larger trials using supportive therapy as the main treatment arm."<|endoftext|>"Eleven studies were conducted with 949 participants who had moderate or severe pain. However, not all participants completed the treatment or had results. Eight studies were double-blind, two were single-blind, and one was open-label. None of the studies had a placebo-only control. Most studies were at high risk of bias. It was not possible to compare NSAIDs as a group or with other treatments. The results for all NSAIDs were reported as a randomised cohort, but the evidence was of very low quality. None of the studies reported the primary outcomes. Four studies showed that NSAIDs reduced moderate or severe pain to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks. Adverse events and withdrawals were inconsistent. Two serious adverse events and 22 deaths were reported, but they were not clearly related to any pain treatment. Common adverse events were thirst/dry mouth, loss of appetite, somnolence, and dyspepsia. Withdrawals were mostly due to lack of efficacy or adverse events. There is no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for the three steps of the three-step WHO cancer pain ladder. There is very low-quality evidence that some people with moderate or severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of"<|endoftext|>"Two studies were conducted with a total of 287 participants. One study had unclear to high risk of bias and involved 253 participants. The quality of evidence for most outcomes was very low. This study found that tinzaparin resulted in a more rapid resolution of pain and fewer hospitalization days compared to the placebo group. The second study had unclear risk of bias and only addressed pain intensity. It found that dalteparin reduced pain intensity more than the placebo group. However, the quality of evidence was rated very low due to serious risk of bias and imprecision. Based on these two studies, there is incomplete evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparins in people with sickle cell disease. Further well-designed studies with other types of low-molecular-weight heparins and in participants with different genotypes of sickle cell disease are needed to confirm or dismiss these results."<|endoftext|>"We did not find any completed randomised trials. However, after comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 36 observational studies (1285 patients), there were no significant differences in the odds of death or the occurrence of ischaemic stroke. For the outcome of death or disability, there was a non-significant trend in favour of anticoagulants. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages and major extracranial haemorrhages occurred only in the anticoagulation group, but the estimates were imprecise and indicated no significant difference between the two treatment modalities. There were no randomised trials comparing either anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs with control, thus there is no evidence to support their routine use for the treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. There were also no randomised trials that directly compared anticoagulants with antiplatelet drugs and the reported non-randomised studies did not show any evidence of a significant difference between the two."<|endoftext|>"We found 26 studies involving 2066 patients, but we couldn't combine the results because the treatments and outcomes were too different. We looked at the results based on the type of wound and the type of silver preparation used. For burns, 13 studies compared silver dressings with non-silver dressings. One study showed that silver nitrate was better at preventing infections than a non-silver dressing, but three studies showed that silver sulphadiazine (SSD) cream caused more infections than non-silver dressings. Six studies compared SSD cream with other silver-containing dressings, but only one showed that a silver-containing dressing (Hydron AgSD) was better at preventing infections than SSD. One study compared two silver-containing dressings and found that silver-coated gauze (Acticoat®) was better at preventing infections than silver nitrate gauze. For other types of wounds, six studies compared silver dressings with non-silver dressings, but most of them found no significant difference in infection rates. Only one study showed that a silver-containing hydrofibre dressing was better at reducing healing time for diabetic foot ulcers. Overall, there isn't enough evidence to say whether silver-containing dressings or topical agents help with wound healing or"<|endoftext|>"We looked at 12 studies with 3571 participants that compared different antimicrobial treatments for adults with VAP. Some studies didn't report outcomes for all participants and most had funding or affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We found no significant difference in all-cause mortality, clinical cure, length of stay in ICU, or adverse events between monotherapy and combination therapy. For the comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives, we found that imipenem-cilastatin had a statistically significant increase in clinical cure compared to tigecycline. We also found that carbapenems may result in better clinical cure than other antibiotics. However, the quality of evidence for mortality, clinical cure, and adverse events was downgraded to moderate or low. These findings may not apply to all patient groups. Overall, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and supports the use of effective monotherapy for empiric treatment."<|endoftext|>"We studied 29 analyses of policies that restricted 11 drug classes. Most participants were senior citizens or low-income adults in publicly subsidized pharmaceutical benefit plans. The impact of policies varied by drug class and whether restrictions were implemented or relaxed. Policies targeting gastric-acid suppressant and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug classes decreased drug use and saved money for up to two years without increasing the use of other health services. Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs increased treatment discontinuity and the use of other health services without reducing overall drug expenditures. Relaxing restrictions for reimbursement of antihypertensives and statins increased appropriate use and decreased overall drug expenditures. Implementing restrictions to coverage and reimbursement of selected medications can decrease third-party drug spending without increasing the use of other health services. Relaxing reimbursement rules for drugs used for secondary prevention can also remove barriers to access. Policy design should be based on research quantifying the harm and benefit profiles of target and alternative drugs to avoid unwanted health system and health effects. Health impact evaluation should be conducted where drugs are not interchangeable. Impacts on health equity require explicit measurement."<|endoftext|>"Nineteen studies were reviewed, involving 4232 participants, with a variety of interventions, populations, outcomes, and measures. Due to the differences between the studies, data could not be combined in a meta-analysis. Instead, similar interventions were grouped together for comparison. Four studies compared any form of one-to-one oral health advice (OHA) to no OHA, with low-quality evidence suggesting a benefit for OHA in reducing gingivitis and plaque. Two studies reported a benefit for OHA in reducing dental caries at 12 months. Four studies compared personalised OHA to routine OHA, but there was little evidence of a difference in outcomes. Five trials compared self-management to professional OHA, but there was little evidence of a difference in outcomes. Seven trials compared enhanced OHA to routine OHA, but there was little evidence of a difference in outcomes. Overall, there was insufficient high-quality evidence to recommend any specific one-to-one OHA method as being effective in improving oral health or being more effective than any other method. More high-quality trials are needed to determine the most effective method of one-to-one OHA."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses five small trials that looked at the effectiveness of different treatments for adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). The trials had varying quality and used different types and dosages of oral steroids. One trial showed that oral steroids provided short-term benefits in pain, range of movement, and function compared to a placebo, but these benefits were not maintained after six weeks. Another trial showed no significant differences between oral steroids and a placebo in pain or range of movement, but suggested that improvement occurred earlier in the steroid-treated group. A third trial showed that oral steroids provided a more rapid initial improvement in pain compared to no treatment, but negligible differences by five months. Overall, the available evidence suggests that oral steroids may provide short-term benefits for adhesive capsulitis, but the effect may not last beyond six weeks."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at three studies with a total of 50 participants that compared rTMS to sham TMS. The studies were of poor quality and had high dropout rates, which increased the risk of bias. None of the studies provided detailed data on the primary outcome, ALSFRS-R scores at six months follow-up. One study had data on secondary outcomes, but found no difference between rTMS and sham rTMS at 12 months follow-up. None of the studies reported any adverse events, but due to the small sample size and methodological limitations, it's unclear if rTMS is completely safe. There isn't enough evidence to say if rTMS is effective or safe for treating ALS, and more studies may be helpful."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 10 studies with a total of 1049 participants that had moderate to high risk of bias. None of the studies had a placebo group. One study found that plasma exchange plus prednisone was better than prednisone alone at controlling the disease after 1 month, while another study found no difference after 6 months. Different doses or formulations of prednisolone, azathioprine plus prednisone, prednisolone plus azathioprine or plasma exchange, prednisolone plus mycophenolate mofetil or plus azathioprine, and tetracycline plus nicotinamide compared with prednisolone did not show any differences in disease control. Chinese traditional medicine plus prednisone was not effective. One study found no significant difference in healing between a standard regimen of topical steroids and a milder regimen. Another study found that clobetasol was more effective than oral prednisolone in people with extensive and moderate disease, with reduced mortality and adverse events. Very potent topical steroids are effective and safe treatments for BP, but their use in extensive disease may be limited by side-effects and practical factors. Milder regimens are safe and effective in moderate BP. Starting doses of prednis"<|endoftext|>"75 trials were conducted on 7957 people with irritable bowel syndrome. The quality of some trials was low, but a few were high. 71 different herbal medicines were tested against placebo or conventional therapy, and some were combined with conventional therapy. Some herbal medicines showed significant improvement in symptoms compared to placebo, while others were not significantly different from conventional therapy. In some trials, combining herbal medicine with conventional therapy showed additional benefits. No serious adverse events were reported. However, caution should be taken when interpreting findings from less rigorous trials. Some herbal medicines should be further examined in high-quality trials."<|endoftext|>"We found 22 studies that looked at using hormonal drugs, including levonorgestrel (LNG), to prevent pregnancy when taken before or after sex. The studies involved 12,400 women from Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs tested included LNG in different doses and other hormonal drugs. The studies looked at pregnancy rates, side effects, and how well women liked the method. Pericoital LNG was found to be effective and safe, with a low pregnancy rate. Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effect, but non-menstrual side effects were mild. Most women liked the method despite the irregular periods. However, some of the studies had issues with their methods and were old. More research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of pericoital LNG as a primary form of contraception for women who have infrequent sex. If it is shown to be effective, safe, and acceptable, it may change current recommendations and marketing strategies."<|endoftext|>"This update includes 14 new studies, bringing the total to 15 studies with data from 561 patients. The studies were conducted in various countries and mostly included adolescents and young adults, but two studies had a wider age range. Most studies had a similar number of male and female patients, but some had more females. Eight studies had a high risk of bias, six had an unclear risk, and one had a low risk. Ten studies compared surgical anchorage to conventional anchorage for the movement of upper first molars. A meta-analysis of seven studies showed that surgical anchorage was more effective than conventional anchorage in reinforcing anchorage by 1.68 mm. However, there was some variation in the results. There was no difference in treatment duration between the two methods. There was limited information on patient-reported outcomes, and no adverse effects were reported. Overall, there is moderate quality evidence that surgical anchorage is more effective than conventional anchorage in reinforcing anchorage, and mini-screw implants show promise. However, there is no information on the harms of either method."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 50 studies involving over 45,000 participants. Most of the studies compared statins to a placebo or no treatment, while a few compared different statin regimens. We found that the quality of the studies was not great, but some studies were conducted well and reported adverse events. Overall, statins were effective in preventing major cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and heart attacks. However, their effects on stroke and kidney function were uncertain, and we don't know much about their potential harms. Statins are useful in preventing cardiovascular events and death in people with CKD who don't have CVD at the start."<|endoftext|>"We found 24,704 citations in our search, but only nine trials with 379 participants met our criteria. Five of the studies involved participants with cerebral palsy (CP) and the other four involved participants with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The participants' ages ranged from 2 to 19 years. Most of the trials were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), except for one. Three trials on CP evaluated intrathecal baclofen (ITB) and two evaluated botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A). All OI trials evaluated bisphosphonates (two alendronate and one pamidronate). None of the trials evaluated commonly used analgesics for this patient group. Pain was a secondary outcome in five of the eight identified studies. The quality of the trials varied, with only one involving over 100 participants. The ITB studies found an effect on pain, but adverse events were related to the procedure or device for administration rather than the drug. The BoNT-A trials found no evidence of a difference in pain, but adverse events mostly involved seizures. Gastrointestinal problems were the most frequent adverse event in those who received alendronate. The trial investigating pamidronate found no evidence of a difference in pain"<|endoftext|>"Seven trials were found, but only six were included in the analysis. Three trials looked at efficacy outcomes, and four looked at safety and tolerability outcomes. Five trials were judged to have a high risk of bias, and three were judged to have a high risk of attrition bias. The evidence suggests that latrepirdine has a low-quality benefit on the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input after 26 weeks. However, it is unclear whether latrepirdine has any effect on cognition or function. There is some evidence of a small benefit on behavior, but further studies are needed to investigate the potential benefit of latrepirdine on neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven studies with 735 participants to see how RIC affects preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. We evaluated the studies for bias and found some to be low and some unclear. We analyzed three trials with 371 participants to see how RIC affects preventing ischaemic stroke. We found that RIC significantly reduced recurrent stroke in people with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of ischaemic stroke in people with carotid stenosis undergoing carotid stenting. Adverse events associated with RIC were higher, but no severe adverse events were reported. We analyzed four trials with 364 participants to see how RIC affects treating ischaemic stroke. We found that RIC increased the rate of death or dependency in people receiving intravenous thrombolysis. There was no significant difference in reducing stroke severity or improving psychological and cognitive impairment. No trial reported ischaemic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke, improvement in neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke, cardiovascular events, and RIC associated adverse events. We found low-quality evidence that RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in participants with intracerebral artery stenosis and reduce stroke severity in participants undergoing carotid"<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies involving 204 premature babies and found that adding protein to human milk increased weight, length, and head circumference growth while having no clear effect on skin fold thickness. However, protein supplementation led to longer hospital stays and higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations. There was not enough evidence to determine if protein supplementation increased the risk of feeding intolerance or necrotizing enterocolitis, or if it affected serum albumin concentrations. We could not find any data on the long-term effects of protein supplementation. The studies we looked at were not conducted in low-resource settings, so our findings may not apply to those settings. Future studies should compare different amounts of protein in multi-component fortifiers and examine their effects on various outcomes."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 45 studies, including 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies. Almost all of the studies compared PEM to no intervention. One study compared paper-based PEM to the same document on CD-ROM. The review found that PEMs may have a small beneficial effect on professional practice outcomes when compared to no intervention. However, there is not enough information to know how PEMs affect patient outcomes or how they compare to other interventions. The review also could not determine which characteristics of PEMs were most effective."<|endoftext|>"Out of 5271 references, 23 RCTs met the criteria for inclusion. Most of the trials were conducted in the USA in health-care clinics, focusing on STI information and safer sex skills. The interventions varied in duration, contact time, provider, and outcomes, and addressed a variety of STIs, but did not explicitly mention HPV or cervical cancer prevention. The trials showed statistically significant effects on behavioral outcomes, such as increasing condom use, but not on biological outcomes. There is uncertainty in the risk of bias due to incomplete reporting. Future evaluations should focus on HPV and its link to cervical cancer, with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behavior change, rates of HPV infection, and progression to cervical cancer. Studies should use an RCT design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate. Evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed twenty studies with a total of 2337 participants. Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation to routine care or conventional information delivery, while one study compared brief psychoeducation to cognitive behavior therapy. Participants who received brief psychoeducation were less likely to be non-compliant with medication in the short and medium term. Compliance with follow-up was similar between the two groups in the short, medium, and long term. Relapse rates were lower among participants receiving brief psychoeducation in the medium term, but not in the long term. Brief psychoeducation can improve long-term global state, promote improved mental state in the short and medium term, and lower the incidence and severity of anxiety and depression. Social function such as rehabilitation status and social disability were also improved in the brief psychoeducation group. There was no difference found in quality of life or death rate in either group. Based on limited evidence, brief psychoeducation appears to reduce relapse in the medium term and promote medication compliance in the short term. However, further high-quality studies are needed to confirm or refute the use of this approach."<|endoftext|>"We analyzed 11 studies with 9839 participants to compare the effectiveness of two treatments for COPD. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD who had not recently experienced exacerbations. One study, which was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and included only people with recent exacerbations, accounted for 37% of participants. All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, which means they may have had biases. The unsponsored study was also at risk of bias. The studies recruited participants with different levels of COPD severity and had follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 52 weeks.

Compared to the LABA+ICS treatment, the LAMA+LABA treatment resulted in fewer exacerbations, a larger improvement in FEV1, a lower risk of pneumonia, and more frequent improvement in quality of life as measured by an increase of 4 or more units on the SGRQ. However, the evidence supporting these findings was of low or moderate quality, and the studies were heterogeneous. Our findings support the recently updated GOLD guidance."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 3 studies involving 91 children aged 6 months to 4 years in emergency departments in the USA and Spain. Heliox was given as a mix of 70% heliox and 30% oxygen. One study of 15 children with mild croup found no difference in croup score changes between heliox and 30% humidified oxygen after 20 minutes. Another study of 47 children with moderate croup found that heliox may slightly improve croup scores after 60 minutes, but there was no difference between groups after 120 minutes. The third study of 29 children with moderate to severe croup found that heliox may slightly improve croup scores after 90 minutes. However, the evidence for all outcomes was of low quality and there was uncertainty about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. More studies are needed to assess the role of heliox in treating children with croup."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses eight studies that looked at the prevalence of vertebral fractures in different healthcare settings. The studies had some flaws, such as poor reporting of tests and a high risk of bias. The studies found that certain red flags, such as significant trauma, older age, and corticosteroid use, were potentially useful in primary care, but their accuracy was imprecise. In tertiary care, contusion/abrasion was found to be informative. Combining red flags improved the accuracy of screening for vertebral fractures. However, many red flags have high false positive rates, so they should be used with caution. Further research is needed to identify appropriate sets of red flags and improve reporting of tests."<|endoftext|>"Two trials were conducted to compare different treatments for urethral stricture disease in men. The first trial compared surgical urethral dilatation and optical urethrotomy in 210 adult men and found no significant difference in the proportion of men being stricture free at three years or in the median time to recurrence. The second trial compared urethrotomy and urethroplasty in 50 men with traumatic stricture of the posterior urethra following pelvic fracture injury. Men in the urethrotomy group were more likely to require further surgery in the first six months than those in the primary urethroplasty group. After two years, more men in the urethrotomy group required continued self-dilatation or further surgery for stricture recurrence compared to those in the primary urethroplasty group. It is unclear which treatment is best for urethral stricture disease in terms of balancing efficacy, adverse effects, and costs. More well-designed trials are needed to answer relevant clinical questions regarding treatment of men with urethral strictures."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at six trials with a total of 1211 patients with persistent asthma. The trials compared daily use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to intermittent use. There was no significant difference in the risk of patients experiencing exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids between the two groups. However, the daily ICS group showed better lung function, asthma control, and reliever use compared to the intermittent group. Both treatments appeared safe, but daily use of budesonide and beclomethasone was associated with modest growth suppression. Clinicians should carefully consider the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, as the long-term impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and function decline is unknown."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies had 341 people on dialysis, four studies had 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies had 1130 people with CKD stages 1 to 5. Eleven studies (900 people) looked at dietary counseling with or without lifestyle advice, and six studies looked at dietary patterns (739 people). The studies were generally of low quality, so the results are not very reliable. The participants were followed up for a median of 12 months. The studies did not look at all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. The evidence suggests that dietary interventions may prevent one person in every 3000 treated for one year from developing ESKD, but the certainty in this effect was very low. The studies showed that dietary interventions may increase health-related quality of life, eGFR, and serum albumin, and lower blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. However, the studies did not measure or report on mortality or cardiovascular events. More research is needed to determine the effects of dietary interventions on patient outcomes."<|endoftext|>"One study was conducted on 156 children aged between seven weeks and 24 months with signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis. The participants were divided into three groups: nebulised salbutamol, nebulised saline, and mist in a tent. The results showed that nebulised salbutamol was effective in reducing respiratory distress symptoms, but mist in a tent and nebulised saline did not show significant improvement. The study did not report any adverse effects of the interventions. Although steam inhalation or cool mist therapy is commonly used to treat acute bronchiolitis in resource-constrained settings, there is insufficient evidence to support its effectiveness in children up to three years old."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four studies involving 1154 participants aged 50 to 90 years with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease. The studies measured changes in cognitive function using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Participants were mostly taking cholinesterase inhibitors. When we combined the data, we found that statins did not provide any significant benefit in improving cognitive function or reducing adverse effects compared to a placebo. The studies did not assess the role of statins in treating vascular dementia. Overall, the studies suggest that statins do not improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at four studies with 149 participants. Two studies looked at night splinting for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, but there were no significant differences between wearing a night splint and not wearing one. One study looked at prednisone treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and found that while it improved some strength and function parameters, it did not significantly improve ankle range of motion. Another study looked at early surgery for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and found that while it increased ankle range of motion at 12 months, functional outcomes were better in the control group and many boys in the surgical group had a relapse of achilles tendon contractures by 24 months. Overall, there is no evidence that any intervention significantly improves ankle range of motion in these conditions and more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"The study included 25 trials with 5218 women, but the quality of the trials varied. The results showed that women who were upright during the first stage of labor had a shorter labor time by about one hour and 22 minutes compared to those who were lying down. They were also less likely to have a caesarean section or an epidural. Babies of mothers who were upright were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. However, there were no significant differences between groups for other outcomes related to the well-being of mothers and babies. The study suggests that women in low-risk labor should be informed of the benefits of upright positions and encouraged to assume whatever positions they choose. However, better quality trials are still needed to confirm the true risks and benefits of upright and mobile positions compared to lying down for all women."<|endoftext|>"This review was difficult because there are no agreed-upon criteria for diagnosing TOS. The review only relied on the diagnosis given by the researchers in the studies. Only one study compared natural progression to an active intervention. Three randomized controlled trials were found, but only two had a follow-up of six months or more, which was the minimum required for inclusion in the review. The first trial involved 55 participants with the disputed type of TOS and compared two treatments. The second trial involved 37 people with TOS of any type and compared a treatment with a botulinum toxin injection to a saline placebo injection. The first trial had a high risk of bias, but TFRR decreased pain more than SNBP. The second trial had a low risk of bias, but there was no significant difference in pain relief or disability improvement between the treatment and placebo groups. However, the treatment did improve paresthesias at six months' follow-up. There is very low quality evidence that TFRR is better than SNBP, but no evidence that either is better than no treatment. There is moderate evidence that treatment with BTX injections is not significantly better than saline injections. There is a need for agreed-upon diagnostic criteria, outcome measures, and high quality randomized trials to compare treatments"<|endoftext|>"This text discusses different treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. A hand brace was found to improve symptoms and function after four weeks. Ultrasound treatment did not show significant benefit in one analysis, but one trial showed improvement after seven weeks which was maintained at six months. Oral steroids were found to significantly improve symptoms compared to placebo, but diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs did not. Vitamin B6 did not significantly improve symptoms. Yoga, carpal bone mobilisation, and steroid and insulin injections for people with diabetes were found to significantly improve symptoms. Ergonomic keyboards did not show clear results. Magnet therapy, laser acupuncture, exercise, and chiropractic care did not show significant benefit. Overall, more trials are needed to compare treatments and determine how long the benefits last."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two studies with a total of 708 participants who had CRVO-ME. One study compared triamcinolone acetonide injections to no treatment, and the other compared dexamethasone implants to fake injections. We found that both studies had some issues with bias and missing data. The dexamethasone implant did not seem to improve vision for people with CRVO-ME, but the triamcinolone injections did help some people gain more letters in visual acuity. However, all groups had a decrease in average visual acuity over time. More people in the treatment groups had adverse events like high eye pressure, cataracts, and retinal neovascularization. We think the evidence is not strong enough to say whether IVS is helpful for people with CRVO-ME."<|endoftext|>"Six studies involving 394 patients found that intranasal corticosteroids were effective in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and reducing adenoid size. In one study, treatment with beclomethasone showed greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in adenoid size compared to a placebo. Another study showed that beclomethasone was effective in reducing the Nasal Obstruction Index. A third study found that mometasone improved symptoms and reduced adenoid size, avoiding the need for adenoidectomy. A fourth study showed that flunisolide was more effective than saline solution in reducing adenoid size. A fifth study found that fluticasone significantly reduced symptoms and adenoid size, avoiding adenoidectomy in 76% of patients. However, one study did not find significant improvement with beclomethasone. Overall, intranasal corticosteroids appear to be effective in improving symptoms and reducing adenoid size in children with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy, but their long-term efficacy is still uncertain."<|endoftext|>"We looked at a small study in Mexico involving 24 women. The study compared a group that received standard treatment for high blood pressure and seizures with a group that received an epidural block instead of the standard treatment. The study found that the epidural block reduced diastolic arterial pressure in the mothers, but there was no significant difference in other outcomes between the two groups. The study did not report on important outcomes such as maternal death, eclampsia, or fetal death. There is not enough evidence to determine if epidural therapy is effective, safe, or cost-effective for treating severe pre-eclampsia in non-laboring women. More research is needed to determine the potential benefits, side effects, and costs of epidural therapy, as well as how it interacts with other treatments and affects patient satisfaction."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 16 trials that met our criteria. All but one of the trials had a high risk of bias. We analyzed data from 15 trials (927 people received glucocorticosteroids and 934 received placebo or no treatment). The glucocorticosteroids were given orally or through injection for about 28 days. The participants were between 25 and 70 years old, had different stages of alcoholic liver disease, and 65% were men. Follow-up was up to the time of discharge from the hospital, until they died (about 63 days), or for at least one year. We found no evidence that glucocorticosteroids had an effect on all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, liver-related mortality, or complications. We are uncertain about the effect of glucocorticosteroids because the evidence was very low. Only one of the trials was not funded by the industry, and we need more trials that follow guidelines and report data properly."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed four trials with 245 participants. The studies had small sample sizes and different interventions, controls, and outcome measures, so we couldn't combine them. Most of the studies had a low risk of bias, but some had a high or unclear risk of bias in areas like performance and attrition. The interventions included driving simulation and skill development. The studies involved relatively young people at different stages of stroke recovery. We found no clear evidence that on-road driving skills improved after training, but road sign recognition was better in those who underwent training. One study suggested that simulator-based driving rehabilitation may be helpful, but we need more research to confirm this. We couldn't find any studies that evaluated on-road driving lessons. It's unclear which impairments can be improved with rehabilitation and which approach is best."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a review of studies on the use of corticosteroid treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD in adults. Eight studies with a total of 582 participants were included in the review, and five of these studies with 519 participants were used for a meta-analysis. The mean age of participants was 65 to 73 years, and the proportion of male participants varied from 58% to 84%. The studies classified COPD as severe or very severe, and corticosteroid treatment was given for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. The studies found that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (around five days) were likely to be sufficient for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD in adults and did not lead to worse outcomes than longer courses (10 to 14 days). The studies did not include people with mild or moderate COPD, and further research is needed to compare short-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment with conventional longer-duration treatment."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one study with 13 participants and found three ongoing studies that examine RBC transfusion methods for people with MDS. The quality of the evidence was very low according to GRADE methodology. The one study we included randomly assigned participants to either a restrictive or liberal transfusion policy based on their haemoglobin levels. We couldn't find enough evidence to determine if there was a difference in all-cause mortality or the number of red blood cell transfusions between the two groups. There were no reported complications or effects on activity levels. The study didn't report on other important factors like mortality due to bleeding or infection, quality of life, or hospital admissions. This review shows that there isn't enough evidence to recommend a specific transfusion strategy for bone marrow failure patients undergoing supportive treatment. We need more studies with strong methodology to determine the best transfusion strategy, especially as the incidence of MDS rises with an aging population."<|endoftext|>"We found 2079 citations in our search, but only included two RCTs out of 84 potentially eligible citations. The first study used a game based on ""Family Feud"" to teach infection control, but did not measure patient or process outcomes. The group that played the game had higher knowledge scores. The second study compared a game-based approach to traditional case-based learning for stroke prevention and management. There was no significant difference in knowledge between the two groups immediately or 3 months after the intervention, but the game-based group reported higher enjoyment. Overall, this review does not confirm or deny the usefulness of games as a teaching tool for healthcare professionals. More high-quality research is needed to explore the impact of educational games on patient and performance outcomes."<|endoftext|>"In eight trials with 475 people, lithium was found to be more effective than antidepressants in preventing relapse (defined as admission to hospital) for both depressive and manic episodes. However, there were no other significant differences between lithium and antidepressants in terms of other outcomes such as quality of life, social and occupational functioning, and side effects. The relative efficacy of lithium and antidepressants in preventing relapse in unipolar affective disorder is unknown, and patients and clinicians should consider the patient's clinical history, side effects, and adherence to treatment when deciding between the two. Large-scale, long-term randomized trials are needed in unselected groups of subjects with unipolar affective disorder."<|endoftext|>"Two studies with a total of 130 patients (67 and 63 patients in each study) were analyzed. Both studies had a low risk of bias. The use of Amifostine did not show any significant differences in the incidence of xerostomia, the decrease of salivary or submandibular gland function, or the reduction of blood pressure. Two patients in one study had adverse reactions to Amifostine but recovered without any lasting effects. A meta-analysis was not performed due to inconsistent findings. The studies did not investigate death, morbidity, quality of life, or costs. The results suggest that Amifostine does not have significant radioprotective effects on salivary glands in high-dose radioactive iodine treated differentiated thyroid cancer patients. More studies are needed to evaluate patient-oriented outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies involving 45 children with Down syndrome aged between 29 months and six years. Two studies compared parent-led interventions to standard treatment, while the third compared a parent-led and clinician-led intervention to a clinician-led intervention alone. The length of treatment varied from 12 weeks to six months. The studies had limitations, so we couldn't combine their results. We judged all three studies to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and outcome assessors. The studies had inconsistent findings, but they did suggest that children in the intervention group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with language targets in certain contexts post-intervention, compared to those in the control group. However, this was not maintained 12 months later. One study found gains for the intervention group on total-language measures immediately post-intervention. No study reported evidence of language attrition following the intervention in either group, while one study found positive outcomes on children's socialisation skills in the intervention group. The studies had limitations, so we have very little confidence in the results. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of parent-led interventions for improving the language and communication of children with Down syndrome."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two trials with a total of 148 participants who had heart valve surgery, but both trials had a high risk of bias. We couldn't find enough evidence to determine if exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to no exercise had an effect on mortality or serious adverse events at 3 to 6 months follow-up. The trials didn't report on health-related quality of life or other outcomes. However, we did find that exercise-based rehabilitation may increase exercise capacity compared to no exercise. We couldn't evaluate the impact on other outcomes due to a lack of evidence, so more high-quality trials are needed to assess the impact of exercise-based rehabilitation on patient-relevant outcomes, including mortality and quality of life."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses five studies that looked at interventions for adults with terminal illnesses. Two studies looked at meditation, while the others looked at palliative care interventions that involved a chaplain or spiritual counselor. The studies on meditation found no significant difference in quality of life or well-being compared to usual care, but combining meditation with massage helped buffer against a reduction in quality of life. The studies on palliative care interventions did not find a significant difference in quality of life or well-being. Coping with the disease was not evaluated in any of the studies. The quality of the studies was limited by under-reporting of design features. Overall, there is inconclusive evidence that interventions with spiritual or religious components may or may not enhance well-being. More rigorous studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six trials with 137 participants. Two studies with 45 participants showed that tDCS did not have a significant effect on the overall UPDRS score, but did have an effect on the motor subsection score. One study with 25 participants measured the reduction in off and on time with dyskinesia, but found no effect. Two trials with 41 participants measured gait speed and found no effect. One study with 25 participants reported on health-related quality of life, but found no significant difference. There was no study on the effects of tDCS on activities of daily living. There were no significant differences in dropouts, adverse events, or deaths between the intervention and control groups. One trial with 16 participants found no effect on gait speed when tDCS was combined with movement therapy. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of tDCS on reducing off time, on time with dyskinesia, and improving health-related quality of life, disability, and impairment in patients with IPD."<|endoftext|>"We added four new studies (N = 154) and excluded four studies from the previous review that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours. We included a total of 12 studies (N = 461), all of which had a high or unclear risk of bias. The quality of evidence was low to very low due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these. Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (N = 32) and did not show significant short-term pain relief (moderate quality evidence). One small study (N = 36) at high risk of bias found statistically significant and clinically important differences in pain intensity at one-year follow-up but not at short-term follow-up when comparing thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents into the subcutaneous space (very low quality evidence). Of two studies that investigated LASB as an addition to rehabilitation treatment, the only study that reported pain outcomes demonstrated no additional benefit from LASB (very low quality evidence). Eight small randomized studies compared sympathetic blockade to various other active interventions, and most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block versus other active treatments (low to very low quality evidence)."<|endoftext|>"A total of 14 trials with 2488 participants met the criteria, but most were small and had a high risk of bias. Four new studies were included. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may not have much effect on incomplete recovery compared to corticosteroids alone. Corticosteroids alone were more effective than antivirals alone, and antivirals plus corticosteroids were more effective than placebo or no treatment. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids probably reduced long-term sequelae compared to corticosteroids alone. Adverse events were not significantly different between treatment and comparison groups. A larger study comparing different antiviral agents may be needed."<|endoftext|>"Two studies were reviewed, one comparing leuprorelin to treosulfan and the other comparing decapeptyl to a placebo. The studies had different control groups, so a meta-analysis was not possible. The evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference in overall survival or progression-free survival between leuprorelin and treosulfan. Alopecia and fatigue were more common with treosulfan. The decapeptyl study reported a longer mean progression-free survival compared to the placebo, but no other outcomes were reported. Overall, there is not enough evidence to determine the safety and effectiveness of LHRH agonists in treating platinum-resistant and platinum-refractory EOC, and the quality of evidence is very low."<|endoftext|>"We found 17 studies that looked at the use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in term and near-term infants with hypoxia. Ten of these studies compared iNO to a control group (either a placebo or standard care without iNO) in infants with moderate or severe illness scores. One study allowed back-up treatment with iNO for infants who continued to have severe illness after two hours. Another study only looked at infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and one study compared iNO to high-frequency ventilation. Six studies enrolled infants with moderate illness scores and randomized them to immediate iNO treatment or iNO treatment only after their condition worsened. Overall, iNO improved outcomes in hypoxaemic term and near-term infants by reducing the need for ECMO (with a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 5.3), but did not affect mortality. Oxygenation was improved in about half of the infants receiving iNO. Infants with diaphragmatic hernia did not benefit from iNO, and earlier treatment did not improve clinical outcomes. There were no differences in disability, deafness, or infant development scores between infants who received iNO and those who did not. An initial concentration of 20 ppm of i"<|endoftext|>"This review looked at seven studies on preventing low-back pain and eight studies on treating it. The quality of the studies was not very good, with only five out of fifteen meeting at least half of the quality criteria. The evidence suggests that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and it's unclear if they are helpful in addition to other preventive measures. It's also unclear if lumbar supports are more effective than other treatments for low-back pain. More high-quality studies are needed, with a focus on ensuring participants use the lumbar supports correctly and measuring outcomes in different types of patients."<|endoftext|>"We added one new study to our update, bringing the total to 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations. The number of participants enrolled was unclear in some studies. Most studies enrolled participants over 18 years old, including those in intensive care units, oncology units, and those receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition. The studies had low or unclear risks of bias, except for blinding. Catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection and catheter colonization, but did not significantly affect clinically diagnosed sepsis, all-cause mortality, or catheter-related local infections. The benefits of catheter impregnation varied depending on the setting and type of participants. There were no significant differences in adverse effects between impregnated and non-impregnated groups. While antimicrobial CVCs are effective in reducing CRBSI and catheter colonization, caution is needed in recommending their routine use in all settings. Further studies should assess important clinical outcomes like sepsis and mortality."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 15 studies, mostly from Bangladesh, India, and Peru, that focused on interventions for infants, children, and pregnant women living in slums or poor urban areas. The interventions were mainly nutrient supplementation and education. The studies had a high risk of bias and the evidence was complex, with a wide range of outcome measures reported. Only a few study findings were reported in meta-analyses. The evidence was very low to moderate overall and there was no evidence of differential impacts of interventions relevant to equity issues. The review found that zinc supplementation for pregnant women did not have an effect on LBW or length, while nutrition education for pregnant women had a positive impact on LBW. There was no evidence of an effect of nutrient supplementation for children on HFA or length. The review suggests that challenges linked to urban slum programming should be taken into account when proposing nutrition-specific interventions. More evidence is needed on the effects of multi-sectorial interventions and upstream practices and policies on nutrition-related outcomes."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 12 studies involving over 1000 participants comparing different types of wound dressings for venous leg ulcers. The results showed no significant difference in healing outcomes between hydrocellular foam dressings and polyurethane foam dressings, or between foam dressings and hydrocolloid, paraffin gauze, hydrocapillary, knitted viscose, or protease modulating matrix dressings. There were also no significant differences in adverse events between the different types of dressings. However, the quality of the evidence was low and more well-designed studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of foam dressings for venous leg ulcers."<|endoftext|>"No studies have assessed the safety of certain COX-2 inhibitors. Two studies were reviewed, one comparing etoricoxib to placebo in IBD patients and the other comparing celecoxib to placebo in patients with ulcerative colitis. Both studies had low risk of bias, but were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in patients and treatment duration. There was no significant difference in exacerbation of IBD or ulcerative colitis between the drug and placebo groups. Adverse events were similar between the drug and placebo groups, with no deaths or serious adverse events reported. GI adverse events led to premature withdrawal from the study in a small percentage of patients. The results were uncertain, so clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of these drugs when treating IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations. Further studies are needed to determine the safety of these drugs."<|endoftext|>"We found 22 studies that met our criteria with over 2310 participants. Most studies had small numbers of participants and short follow-up periods. Some studies included only people with infected ulcers, while others included people with non-infected ulcers. Various topical antimicrobial treatments were used, including dressings and solutions. We compared different treatments and found that using an antimicrobial dressing may increase the number of ulcers healed, but the evidence is not strong. There is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events between systemic antibiotics and topical antimicrobial treatments. More research is needed to evaluate the effects of topical antimicrobial treatments on diabetic foot wounds."<|endoftext|>"We looked at six studies with 5193 participants and found that taking zinc supplements can reduce the incidence of pneumonia by 13% and the prevalence of pneumonia by 41%. We also found that zinc reduced the incidence of pneumonia confirmed by chest examination or chest radiograph by 21%, but had no effect on pneumonia defined by age-specific fast breathing with or without lower chest indrawing. Overall, taking zinc supplements can help reduce the incidence and prevalence of pneumonia in children."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at ten studies with over 33,000 participants to see if vitamin A can prevent acute respiratory infections. Eight studies found that vitamin A did not have a significant effect on preventing these infections or reducing symptoms. One study found that vitamin A actually increased the incidence of acute respiratory infections and two other studies found that it increased coughing and fever. Three studies found no difference in the use of vitamin A. Two studies found that vitamin A reduced the incidence of acute respiratory infections in malnourished children, but increased it in healthy children. Therefore, vitamin A should not be given to all children to prevent acute respiratory infections. While it can help prevent diarrheal illnesses, its benefits for preventing acute respiratory infections are limited to populations with malnutrition. Low-dose vitamin A has fewer side effects and is just as effective as high-dose vitamin A."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at 20 different trials that met certain criteria. The treatments given varied from no treatment to a combination of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. The study found that treatment improved forced expiratory volume, forced vital capacity, and maximum oxygen consumption. Arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels also improved at rest. However, walking distance and breathlessness did not improve. Theophylline had a modest effect on lung function and improved blood gas levels, but it also had a higher risk of causing nausea. Despite this, patients preferred theophylline over placebo. Few participants withdrew from the studies. The study suggests that the participants may have been known to be tolerant to theophylline, which could limit the generalizability of the results."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 10 studies involving 439 children with egg allergies, aged 1 to 18 years. The studies used different methods of oral immunotherapy, but none used sublingual immunotherapy. Three studies used a placebo and seven used an egg avoidance diet as the control. The main outcomes were the amount of egg that could be eaten without adverse effects and complete recovery from egg allergy. Most children in the oral immunotherapy group could eat a partial serving of egg, but fewer than half could tolerate a full serving. Serious adverse events requiring epinephrine occurred in 8.4% of children in the oral immunotherapy group, but none in the control group. Mild-to-severe adverse events were more common in the oral immunotherapy group. The studies had inconsistent methods and small sample sizes, and the quality of evidence was low. Oral immunotherapy appears to be effective, but there are risks and uncertainties."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four trials with 579 participants and found that there was no difference in the risk of long-term mortality between those who received ILR and those who were managed conventionally. Two studies reported data on adverse events after ILR implant, but we couldn't do a formal analysis because of missing data. Two studies showed a trend towards a reduction in syncope relapses after diagnosis in participants implanted with ILR. Cost analyses from two studies showed higher overall mean costs in the ILR group, but the mean cost per diagnosis and the mean cost per arrhythmic diagnosis were lower for participants who received ILR. Participants who underwent ILR implantation experienced higher rates of diagnosis compared to those in the standard assessment group. We found no evidence that an ILR-based diagnostic strategy reduces long-term mortality compared to a standard diagnostic assessment. Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of ILRs on clinically relevant outcomes such as quality of life, syncope relapse, and costs."<|endoftext|>"We found four small studies that enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. Participants were randomly assigned to either aspiration and sclerotherapy or surgery. All studies had low or unclear risk of bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators. There was no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups, but there was significant heterogeneity. When one study was removed from the analysis, the result was significant in favor of surgery. Sclerotherapy had a higher recurrence rate compared to surgery. There was no significant difference in haematoma formation between the two groups. Only one study reported patient satisfaction, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of different types of sclerosant agents, sclerosing solution concentration, and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles. Studies should evaluate clinical outcomes such as pain, recurrence, satisfaction, complications, and cure using validated instruments. Cost-effectiveness studies should also be undertaken."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one study that compared a medicine called nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) to a placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection. We found that the study was done well and had low risk of bias. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the main outcome, which was the proportion of children who were cough-free after two weeks. However, the group that received the placebo had less night time coughing than the group that received nebulised rhDNase. Other outcomes, such as difficulty breathing and lung function tests, also favored the placebo group but were not statistically significant. We don't have enough evidence to say which treatment is best for airway malacia. More studies are needed to look at different treatments, including antibiotics and chest physiotherapy, and to measure the effects on the trachea and other physiological outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 21 studies with 2658 participants who received psychological therapy. None of the studies included physical therapy. Most of the studies evaluated cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), but some looked at other types of therapy. The number of therapy sessions and follow-up time varied. Most participants had chronic symptoms. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding and high loss to follow-up. Psychological therapy was better than usual care or waiting list, but there was a higher dropout rate. CBT was the only therapy with enough evidence to draw conclusions. It reduced symptoms, but not more than enhanced care. There were no major harms reported. It's unclear how many people are willing to receive psychological treatment. More studies are needed on other types of therapy and physical therapy. Future studies should include participants of different ages and blind outcome assessors."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed 63 studies on regional anesthesia for preventing persistent pain after surgery. We found that epidural anesthesia for thoracotomy and regional anesthesia for breast cancer surgery and caesarean section may reduce the risk of persistent pain. Intravenous infusion of local anesthetics may also reduce the risk of persistent pain after breast cancer surgery. However, the evidence is limited and there are risks of bias and missing data. We cannot extend these conclusions to other surgeries or anesthesia techniques. There are ongoing studies that may change our conclusions."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses the results of 28 trials involving 1742 participants with borderline personality disorder. The trials tested various drugs, including first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and omega-3 fatty acids. The findings suggest that second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and omega-3 fatty acids may be helpful, but more research is needed. Adverse effects were observed with olanzapine, including weight gain and sedation. Direct comparisons between drugs did not show significant differences, except for olanzapine, which showed more weight gain and sedation than fluoxetine. Antidepressants were not widely supported for BPD treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. The drugs did not significantly influence the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance, and abandonment. The limitations of the RCT evidence constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven trials with 349 participants, but only 217 completed the studies. Three trials were cross-over and four were parallel-group randomised controlled trials. Two more trials were added for this update. Some of the trials had limitations, such as small sample sizes or difficulties with recruitment and maintaining participants. The studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures, but none of them addressed certain important factors, such as patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain, and psychological health. The trials assessed only three of the eight intervention comparisons identified. The evidence was of low or very low quality due to the high risk of bias of the included studies. The data from the trials comparing different washout policies were limited and generally of poor methodological quality or were poorly reported. Further high-quality trials are needed to determine if washouts are beneficial or harmful and to compare different washout solutions, volumes, and frequencies or timings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 30 studies with a total of 18,682 participants. 18 studies were focused on the main objective and 22 studies were focused on secondary objectives. We found differences between studies in cancer diagnosis, treatment, age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and sample size. All studies had at least one unclear or high-risk item. We couldn't combine the results due to differences between studies. 18 studies reported severe fatigue prevalence, ranging from 0% to 61.7%. Prevalence rates were higher in participants aged 16 and over than in children aged up to 18 years. Prevalence rates in survivors of haematological cancer ranged from 1.8% to 35.9%, while in brain cancer survivors, it was 14.6% and 21.1%. Survivors were more often fatigued than controls, but this difference was statistically significant in only two studies. Depression might be associated with fatigue, but age at diagnosis and education level did not seem to be associated with fatigue. One study found that 31.4% of participants reported persistent severe fatigue over 2.7 years. The evidence is weak, and the exact prevalence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains to"<|endoftext|>"We studied 36 trials with 6914 people and found differences in the antibiotics used, patient characteristics, and risk of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and mortality in the control groups. Trials that compared a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics showed a significant decrease in both RTIs and total mortality in the treated group. Trials that compared topical antimicrobials alone or with systemic antibiotics versus systemic antibiotics alone showed a significant decrease in RTIs but not in total mortality in the treated group. Using a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics reduces RTIs and overall mortality in adult patients receiving intensive care. Using only topical prophylaxis reduces respiratory infections but not mortality. The risk of resistance occurring as a negative consequence of antibiotic use was only explored in one trial, which did not show any such effect."<|endoftext|>"Five studies were included in this analysis, all of which looked at educational approaches to reducing the use of physical restraints in nursing homes. Two studies offered consultation and two offered guidance to nursing staff. Four studies looked at nursing home residents and one study looked at residents in group dwelling units. The studies had low methodological quality and inconsistent results. One study found an increase in physical restraint use in both groups after eight months, while three studies found reduced use of physical restraints in the intervention groups after seven and 12 months. The single study examining residents in group dwelling units found no change in physical restraint use in the intervention group after six months, but an increase in the control group. Overall, there is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of educational interventions for reducing physical restraint use in geriatric long-term care."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at four studies involving 416 women who were undergoing IVF treatment. The studies compared the use of glucocorticoid supplements to a placebo. However, two of the studies could not be included in the analysis. The evidence was of low quality due to small sample sizes and few events. The results suggest that there may be a slight increase in clinical pregnancy rate with glucocorticoid supplements, but there is not enough evidence to determine if there is a difference in live birth rate. There was also not enough evidence to determine if there was a difference in multiple-pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. The safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid supplements in IVF treatment is unclear and more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight trials involving 291 participants aged between five and 23 years. Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH to no treatment, while one three-arm trial compared placebo, standard-dose rhGH, and high-dose rhGH. Six trials lasted for one year and two for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some pulmonary function outcomes, but there was no difference between standard and high-dose levels. RhGH therapy improved height, weight, and lean body mass, but there were no differences between dose levels. RhGH therapy also caused a change in fasting blood glucose levels, but it did not cause diabetes. There is limited evidence for improvement in pulmonary exacerbations and exercise capacity, and inconsistent evidence for improvement in quality of life. No significant changes in clinical status or side-effects were observed. Long-term, well-designed randomized controlled trials of rhGH in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH in CF."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 26 studies with 1,695 participants that compared complete removal from exposure, reduced exposure, and continued exposure. Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment, changing to another job, or implementing education programs. In studies comparing removal from exposure to continued exposure, removal may improve asthma symptoms and lung function, and increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms. In studies comparing reduction of exposure to continued exposure, reduction may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms. When comparing removal from exposure to reduction of exposure, removal may improve symptoms and lung function more for patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. However, removal from exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment and decrease income. The quality of evidence is very low for all outcomes. More high-quality studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions for occupational asthma."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at six trials involving 1758 participants aged 48 to 57 years (except for one trial with an average age of 73 years) who had nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis. Five trials studied on-demand deprescribing and one trial examined abrupt discontinuation of PPI. The evidence suggests that continuous PPI use is better than on-demand use for controlling symptoms, but on-demand use can reduce the number of pills taken per week. On-demand use may also lead to reduced participant satisfaction. There is not enough information to determine the long-term benefits and harms of PPI discontinuation. In people with mild GERD, on-demand deprescribing may lead to an increase in GI symptoms and a reduction in pill burden."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 13 studies with 975 participants that compared social skills programs to standard care or discussion groups. The evidence showed that social skills programs were better than standard care in improving social functioning, reducing relapse and rehospitalization rates, and improving mental state and quality of life. However, when compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in these outcomes. The quality of evidence for these findings was very low. It's unclear if these results apply to different cultures and settings, and more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"One study met the criteria and showed that biweekly pegloticase infusion reduced tophi in participants with tophi, but caused more adverse events and withdrawals compared to placebo. Monthly infusion appeared to be less effective. Biweekly treatment resulted in resolution of tophi in more participants compared to placebo, but also had more adverse events. Monthly treatment had similar results. The study suggests that pegloticase can be beneficial in managing tophi in gout, but more research is needed to consider other interventions."<|endoftext|>"The search found five studies on oral immunoglobulin for preventing NEC, but only three met the criteria. In these three studies, which included 2095 babies, giving IgG or a combination of IgG/IgA orally did not significantly reduce the incidence of definite NEC, suspected NEC, need for surgery, or death from NEC. Based on these trials, there is no evidence to support using oral immunoglobulin to prevent NEC. There are no randomized controlled trials on using oral IgA alone for this purpose."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses the results of several studies comparing different treatments for women who have had a hysterectomy and radiotherapy. The studies looked at the effectiveness of adding chemotherapy to the treatment. The results showed that adding chemotherapy can improve overall survival and reduce the risk of recurrence outside the pelvis. However, the effectiveness of chemotherapy in preventing pelvic recurrence is unclear. Overall, the study suggests that postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy can be beneficial for women who have had a hysterectomy and radiotherapy."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 35 studies from different countries on six continents. Some studies asked people about their experiences with digital health interventions, while others were hypothetical. The studies covered different types of digital communication, such as medication reminders and prenatal health information. Clients had mixed experiences with these programs. Some felt supported and connected, while others had problems accessing them due to poor network or phone issues. Language and privacy concerns were also raised. Clients suggested using neutral language and tailoring the content and timing of messages. Future programs should consider these factors when designing and implementing digital health interventions."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 23 trials with 2467 people. When comparing methadone to other treatments, we found no difference in completion of treatment or number of people who stayed abstinent. However, we couldn't compare discomfort or adverse events. This was true when comparing methadone to adrenergic agonists, other opioid agonists, anxiolytic, and paiduyangsheng. When comparing methadone to placebo, the placebo group had more severe withdrawal symptoms and drop-outs. Overall, the medications used were similarly effective, but the symptoms experienced varied. The studies were hard to compare because the programs and outcome measures were different. Slow tapering with temporary substitution of long-acting opioids can reduce withdrawal severity, but most patients still relapsed to heroin use."<|endoftext|>"Nine studies, involving 1109 participants, were reviewed. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but shorter than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone. Naltrexone can be established more quickly with antagonist-induced withdrawal than with clonidine and symptomatic medications. Sedation level does not affect withdrawal intensity and duration, but the duration of anesthesia may influence withdrawal severity. Heavy sedation has a greater risk of adverse events than light sedation and probably has more risks than other forms of detoxification. Heavy sedation does not provide additional benefits in terms of less severe withdrawal or increased rates of naltrexone maintenance treatment. Antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anesthesia is not supported due to potentially life-threatening adverse events and high cost. Therefore, this form of treatment should not be pursued."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 14 studies with varying durations, some lasting only 10 days and others over three months. The available data does not show that molindone is more effective than a placebo or other typical antipsychotics. Molindone does not cause more movement disorders than typical drugs, but it does cause more weight loss. However, the evidence for molindone is limited due to small sample sizes, poor study design, and incomplete reporting. While it may be effective, it does not have a significantly different adverse effect profile than typical antipsychotics, except for weight loss. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest that molindone has an atypical profile."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 20 studies with 2125 participants and 23 different treatments for melasma. The treatments were too different to combine the data statistically. The studies used different interventions, but they can be grouped into those using bleaching agents, triple-combination creams, and other less conventional therapies. Triple-combination cream was the most effective at lightening melasma. Azelaic acid was also effective, but only when compared to 2% hydroquinone. Tretinoin was effective in reducing the severity of melasma, but the quality of the studies was generally poor. Adverse events were mild and transient. More high-quality studies are needed to determine the best treatments for melasma."<|endoftext|>"Twelve trials with 1319 participants were reviewed, but the quality of the trials was not high. Only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU, and not all studies reported population characteristics. A significant reduction in surgical failure was found in eyes at high risk of failure and those undergoing surgery for the first time receiving regular-dose 5-FU postoperative injections. No surgical failures were detected in studies assessing combined surgery. Intraocular pressure was reduced in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving intraoperative 5-FU and regular-dose postoperative 5-FU. No evidence was found of an increased risk of serious sight-threatening complications, but other complications are more common after 5-FU injections. Postoperative injections of 5-FU are now rarely used as part of routine packages of postoperative care but are increasingly used on an ad hoc basis. The small but statistically significant reduction in surgical failures and intraocular pressure at one year in the primary trabeculectomy group and high-risk group must be weighed against the increased risk of complications and patient preference."<|endoftext|>"55 studies with over 16,000 participants were analyzed to see if long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) helped patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The results showed that ICS did not consistently reduce the decline in lung function (FEV1) or mortality, but did reduce the number of exacerbations and slowed the decline in quality of life. However, there were side effects such as an increased risk of candidiasis and hoarseness, and a higher risk of pneumonia in some cases. Patients and doctors should weigh the benefits and risks of using ICS for COPD."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 80 studies involving 5820 women that compared 20 different pain relievers (18 non-selective and 2 COX-2-specific) to each other, placebo, or paracetamol. NSAIDs were found to be more effective than placebo for pain relief in women with primary dysmenorrhoea, but they also had more adverse effects. When compared to each other, there was little evidence to suggest that any one NSAID was better than the others. Only two studies looked at COX-2-specific inhibitors, and there was not enough evidence to suggest they were more effective or tolerable than traditional NSAIDs. NSAIDs were found to be more effective than paracetamol for pain relief, but there was not enough evidence to suggest a difference in adverse effects. Most of the studies were commercially funded, and the quality of evidence was rated as low due to poor reporting of study methods."<|endoftext|>"We looked at seven studies with 2565 participants that compared high and low levels of PEEP. In five studies with 2417 participants, the same tidal volume was used in both groups, but in two studies with 148 participants, the tidal volume was different. Three studies had a risk of bias, but the others were good quality. We only looked at mortality before hospital discharge in the five studies with the same tidal volume, and found no significant difference between high and low PEEP in terms of mortality or risk of barotrauma. Oxygenation was better in the high-PEEP group, but there was a lot of variation in the data. The number of ventilator-free days was the same in both groups, and we couldn't pool data on length of stay in the ICU. In the subgroup of participants with ARDS, there was lower mortality in the ICU, but two of the three studies used a different ventilatory strategy. Overall, high PEEP did not reduce mortality before hospital discharge, and there was no significant difference in risk of barotrauma, but it did improve oxygenation. The studies were different from each other in important ways."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 42 studies with 11,399 patients, including 19 studies from 2010 and 23 new studies. Fifteen studies were excluded from the original review due to concerns about data integrity or lack of patient information. The review found that HES fluid therapy increased the risk of kidney failure and the need for RRT compared to other fluid therapies. HES therapy also increased the risk of AKI based on RIFLE-F criteria, but decreased the risk of AKI based on RIFLE-R criteria. However, when urine output was excluded, the risk of AKI in HES-treated patients was not significant. The risk of AKI was higher in patients treated with HES products compared to other fluids, regardless of the type of patient or HES solution used. The study suggests that alternate volume replacement therapies should be used instead of HES products."<|endoftext|>"We found nine studies with 682 participants, but none of them reported blinding or group allocation methods. Seven studies had complete outcome reporting, three studies had all relevant outcomes reported, and two studies had no other potential biases. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale to no treatment, and two studies compared it to captopril. Rheum officinale had a positive effect on SCr and BUN compared to no treatment, but there was no significant difference compared to captopril. There was no data on all-cause mortality or cost of treatment, and only minor adverse events were reported. The evidence for the effectiveness of Rheum officinale in improving SCr and BUN levels in patients with CKD is limited and of low quality. There is currently no evidence to support its use."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 72 papers about the IQCODE test and chose 13 papers with data from 2745 people (1413 with dementia). When we combined the data, we found that the test was 91% accurate at detecting dementia (with a range of 86% to 94%), but only 66% accurate at ruling it out (with a range of 56% to 75%). The test was better at detecting dementia in a general hospital setting than in a specialist memory setting. The length of the test and the language it was given in did not affect its accuracy. However, there were some problems with the studies we looked at, including differences in the prevalence of dementia and potential biases in the way participants were chosen. Overall, the IQCODE test can be useful for identifying older adults who may have dementia and need further assessment, but its accuracy may be limited in some cases."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies with 91 participants that investigated different types of outpatient rehabilitation programs for adults with chronic stroke who had upper limb spasticity after receiving BoNT treatment. All three studies were considered low quality and had a high risk of bias. The rehabilitation programs included modified constraint-induced movement therapy, task practice therapy with cyclic functional electrical stimulation, and occupational therapy with dynamic elbow extension splinting. The evidence showed that modified constraint-induced movement therapy improved upper limb motor function and spasticity for up to six months, while dynamic elbow splinting and occupational therapy reduced elbow range of motion at 14 weeks. Task practice therapy with cyclic FES did not show significant improvement compared to task practice therapy alone. There is not enough evidence to determine the best types and intensities of therapy for improving active and passive function in adults and children with post-stroke spasticity. More research is needed in this area."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses four trials that involved a total of 136 participants. The trials compared different treatments for preventing the recurrence of HBV infection after liver transplantation. Two trials compared lamivudine alone to HBIg alone, with randomisation performed at different times. Another trial compared combination treatment with lamivudine and HBIg to lamivudine alone after one month of combination treatment. The fourth trial compared the combination of lamivudine and HBIg to a combination of lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil after at least 12 months of lamivudine and HBIg combination treatment. None of the comparisons showed statistically significant differences in outcomes. The trials were not powerful enough to show a difference in HBV recurrence, and no meta-analyses were performed. The review concludes that large randomised clinical trials are needed to compare long-term combination treatment to each of the monotherapy alone, including newer antiviral drugs, for preventing the recurrence of HBV infection after liver transplantation."<|endoftext|>"A search found 13,306 citations, but only 15 publications (10 studies) were included. These studies involved 1019 participants who were followed for 3 months to 10 years. All studies had a high risk of bias. Sulphonylurea (SU) with insulin did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone at 3 or 12 months. SU (with or without metformin) gave poorer metabolic control compared to insulin alone. SU also caused earlier insulin dependence. No intervention influenced fasting C-peptide, but insulin maintained stimulated C-peptide better than SU. GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase formulated with aluminium hydroxide) showed improvements in fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels after 5 years. Chinese remedies and vitamin D with insulin did not show significant differences in improving fasting C-peptide levels compared to insulin alone. Comparing studies was difficult due to heterogeneity. There was limited evidence on adverse events and no significant evidence for or against other lines of treatment of LADA."<|endoftext|>"70 studies with almost 45,000 participants were reviewed, and 63 studies with over 42,000 participants were analyzed. The studies were of moderate or low quality. The researchers were interested in outcomes that lasted at least four months after the intervention. They only reported results for delivery modes that were not substantially different. The results showed that social norms interventions did not have a significant impact on preventing alcohol misuse among college/university students. Although some effects were found, they were too small to be meaningful for policy or practice. Additionally, the effects were not consistent for all measures of alcohol misuse, and there may have been bias in the studies."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three trials involving 492 participants who had received 530 THA. The evidence presented had a high risk of bias. One study with 81 participants compared outcomes for those who received hip precautions, equipment, and functional restrictions versus those who did not. The evidence was of very low quality, so we are uncertain if these measures improved function or health-related quality of life compared to not providing them. There were no hip dislocations or adverse events in either group during the first 12 months. Another study with 265 participants evaluated the provision of hip precautions with or without postoperative equipment and restrictions. The evidence was of very low quality, so we are uncertain if perceived satisfaction in the rate of recovery differed between those who were prescribed postoperative equipment and restrictions versus those who were not. We are also uncertain if the incidence of hip dislocation differed between the two groups. A third study with 146 participants investigated the provision of enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation versus conventional rehabilitation. The evidence was of very low quality, so we are uncertain if the provision of enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation improved function compared to conventional rehabilitation. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the adoption of different occupational therapy interventions for those who undergo THA. Further high-quality trials are needed"<|endoftext|>"This study looked at three trials comparing the use of the LNG-IUD to other treatments for painful periods in women with endometriosis. Two of the trials showed that the LNG-IUD group had fewer painful periods compared to those who did not use it. The LNG-IUD group also reported higher satisfaction with their treatment, but this was not statistically significant. More women in the LNG-IUD group reported changes in their menstruation, but the number of women who did not complete treatment was the same in both groups. In one trial, women using the LNG-IUD had lower pain scores than those using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists, but this was not statistically significant. The study suggests that using the LNG-IUD after surgery may help reduce the recurrence of painful periods in women with endometriosis, but more research is needed to confirm this."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 24 studies that investigated the effects of changing the number of food options or the positioning of foods on people's behavior. Most of the studies (20/24) had concerns about bias and all of them looked at food products, not alcohol or tobacco. Most studies were done in labs with adult participants and used between-participants designs. All studies were done in high-income countries, mostly in the USA. Some studies changed the number of options available or the proportion of healthier options, while others changed the distance or order of food placement. The evidence suggests that changing the number of options or positioning of foods can lead to meaningful changes in behavior, but the certainty of this evidence is low or very low. More research is needed in real-world settings, with a wider range of foods and over sustained time periods."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for preventing HIV transmission. There were no randomized controlled trials found, but one case-control study showed that deep injury, visible blood on the device, procedures involving a needle placed in the source patient's blood vessel, and terminal illness in the source patient were associated with HIV transmission. After controlling for these risk factors, there were no differences in the rates at which cases and controls were offered PEP with zidovudine. However, cases were less likely to have taken zidovudine after exposure compared to controls. Adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen, but discontinuation rates were not significantly different. A four-week regimen of PEP should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion. A combination of antiretroviral drugs should be used for PEP, and healthcare workers should be counseled about expected adverse events and the strategies for managing these. PEP is not 100% effective in preventing HIV seroconversion, and a randomized controlled clinical trial is neither ethical nor practical. A formal systematic review of all relevant animal studies is recommended."<|endoftext|>"The evidence for behavior therapy is lacking, except for a small improvement in mood right after treatment compared to an active control. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has some positive effects on disability and catastrophizing, but not on pain or mood when compared to active controls. CBT has small to moderate effects on pain, disability, mood, and catastrophizing immediately after treatment compared to usual treatment or waiting list, but most effects disappear at follow-up. There is not enough information on the quality or content of treatment to determine their influence on the outcome. CBT is more effective than usual treatment or waiting list in improving mood and catastrophizing, with some evidence of maintenance at six months. Behavior therapy has no effect on mood but has an effect on catastrophizing immediately after treatment. CBT is a useful approach to managing chronic pain, but more studies are needed to identify which components of CBT work for which patients and outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 881 documents and found 15 national initiatives that met our criteria, involving over 260,000 people. None of the initiatives were in lower-middle-income or low-income countries. Most initiatives used an uncontrolled pre-post study design, and we focused on individual initiatives due to high study heterogeneity. Ten initiatives had enough data for quantitative analysis, but the evidence was graded as very low due to bias and variation in results. Five initiatives showed a decrease in salt intake, while two showed an increase. Seven of the 10 initiatives were multi-component and had structural interventions. For women, three initiatives showed a decrease in salt intake, while for men, five initiatives showed a decrease. There were no adverse effects found. The quality of evidence was low, but population-level interventions have the potential to reduce salt intake, especially if they are multi-component and have structural interventions. Future initiatives should have better evaluation methods."<|endoftext|>"We found 18 studies, but only seven met our criteria. All studies had a small number of participants, ranging from seven to 16 people per study and had a cross-over design. Amitriptyline, bromocriptine, clonidine, propranolol, levodopa, and tryptophan were compared with placebo. Results were imprecise and consistent with benefit, no difference or harm. Adverse effects were frequent in people who took amitriptyline and propranolol. Clonidine was associated with prolonged morning hypotension in three of 16 participants. There was insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of sleep bruxism. This systematic review points to the need for more, well-designed, RCTs with larger sample sizes and adequate methods of allocation, outcome assessment, and duration of follow-up."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 10 studies with 1015 participants that compared different types of supplements. Some of the studies had flaws in their methods. The studies were different in many ways, including the type and length of the supplements given and the outcomes reported. All studies reported on mortality, but there was no difference in all-cause mortality between groups. We are unsure if the supplements improve ICU length of stay, ventilator days, or oxygenation at day 4. We are also unsure if the supplements increase adverse events. Overall, the quality of evidence is very low, and more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses studies that compared different methods of asking participants about adverse events (AEs). The studies found that more specific questioning led to more AEs being reported. Some studies showed that more severe AEs were reported with open-ended questions, while less severe AEs were only reported with specific questions. However, some severe AEs were only detected through participant interviews. The studies did not find a difference in the nature of AEs between different questioning methods. Overall, the studies suggest that the method used to ask about AEs can affect the detection of these events. It is important to use clear definitions and terminology for AEs and to report how they were assessed and graded. Any questioning method used should be feasible for both staff and participants."<|endoftext|>"We found 592 records through various databases and search methods. After removing duplicates, we screened 381 records based on their title and abstract. Out of these, we excluded 364 records and assessed 17 full-text articles. We excluded 15 studies that did not measure interventions to prevent SUDEP or were not directly related to SUDEP. One study is still awaiting classification. We included one case-control study that found a protective effect for nocturnal supervision in preventing SUDEP. However, the study had serious risk of bias and did not report on other factors such as changes in quality of life or hospital attendances. Overall, there is very low-quality evidence for the effectiveness of nocturnal supervision in preventing SUDEP. Further research is needed to identify the effectiveness of other interventions such as seizure detection devices, safety pillows, SSRIs, early surgical evaluation, educational programmes, and opiate and adenosine antagonists in preventing SUDEP in people with epilepsy."<|endoftext|>"35 references to 21 studies were found, but only 7 studies with a total of 208 participants were eligible for inclusion. The studies compared autogenic drainage to other airway clearance techniques and had varying study designs, participant numbers, and study durations. The quality of evidence was generally low due to design issues and outcome reporting bias. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the most commonly measured outcome, with only three studies reporting on quality of life. Autogenic drainage was not found to be superior to other techniques, but larger studies are needed to better evaluate its effectiveness. The varied length and design of the studies made analysis of pooled data difficult."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a review of studies on the effectiveness of psychological therapies for treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The review included 25 studies with a total of 1305 participants, and 22 of these studies (with 1060 participants) provided data for meta-analyses. The results showed that psychological therapies based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) were more effective than usual care or waitlist in achieving clinical response and reducing anxiety, worry, and depression symptoms. However, there were no studies that looked at the long-term effects of CBT compared to usual care or waitlist. Six studies compared CBT to other types of therapy, but there was no significant difference in clinical response between CBT and supportive therapy. The evidence comparing CBT to other psychological therapies is limited and inconsistent, so more research is needed to determine the most effective forms of psychological therapy for treating GAD."<|endoftext|>"In 12 trials, involving 1,856 women, progestogen treatment was compared to either placebo or no treatment. The trials were conducted in India, Jordan, UK, and USA. Most of the trials were at low risk of bias. The analysis of all women suggests that progestogen supplementation may reduce the number of miscarriages compared to placebo or no treatment. However, there were no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. None of the trials reported on any secondary maternal outcomes, but there was a slight benefit for women receiving progestogen in the outcome of live birth rate. The effect on the rate of preterm birth is uncertain. There were no clear differences for women receiving progestogen for other secondary outcomes. For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages, supplementation with progestogen therapy may reduce the rate of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 14 studies with 1298 participants. Nine studies (704 participants) compared CM to control, and five studies (594 participants) compared MIB interventions to control. We didn't find any studies that looked at other types of psychosocial interventions. It wasn't clear if the studies we included controlled for biases, as this information wasn't often reported. We assessed the risk of bias in the studies we included relating to participant selection, allocation concealment, personnel and outcome assessor blinding, and attrition. The studies we included rarely looked at maternal and neonatal outcomes. For the studies that did measure these outcomes, there was no difference in pre-term birth rates, maternal toxicity at delivery, or low birth weight. However, neonates stayed in the hospital for fewer days after delivery in CM intervention groups. There were no differences observed in retention or abstinence in any psychosocial intervention group compared to control. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate. The evidence suggests that there is no difference in treatment outcomes to address drug use in pregnant women with the use of psychosocial interventions, when taken in the presence of other comprehensive care options. However, few studies evaluated obstetrical or neonatal outcomes, making it difficult to assess"<|endoftext|>"We found 31 studies with over 27,000 participants comparing the transradial and transfemoral approaches for diagnostic coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention. The transradial approach was associated with lower rates of short-term adverse events, cardiac death, bleeding, and access site complications, but had a lower procedural success rate. There was no significant difference in short-term myocardial infarction between the two approaches. However, there is not enough evidence to determine the long-term outcomes beyond 30 days."<|endoftext|>"We found two studies on palliative care for people with advanced dementia, but they were too different to combine their results. They measured 31 different outcomes, but none of them were the same. There are six more studies coming in the future. Both studies had problems with bias and small sample sizes, so we can't be very certain about the evidence. One study looked at a palliative care team for people with advanced dementia in the hospital. They found that more participants in the intervention group had a palliative care plan, but it was only adopted for two people. The plan was more likely to be available on discharge in the intervention group. The study didn't find any evidence that the intervention affected mortality or clinical care. Another study looked at a decision aid for end-of-life feeding options for nursing home residents with advanced dementia. The intervention group had lower decisional conflict scores and were more likely to discuss feeding options with a clinician, but the results were uncertain. Overall, there isn't enough evidence to say if palliative care interventions work for advanced dementia. However, there are more studies being done in this area."<|endoftext|>"Three trials compared different sequencing methods for adjuvant therapy in 1166 women with breast cancer. The results showed no significant differences in survival rates between the methods. However, concurrent chemoradiation increased the risk of anaemia, telangiectasia, and pigmentation. Physician-reported assessments showed worse cosmesis with concurrent chemoradiation, but treated women did not report this. One trial showed that RT before CT increased the risk of neutropenic sepsis compared to CT before RT. Overall, the data suggests that different sequencing methods do not have a major effect on recurrence or survival if RT is started within seven months after surgery."<|endoftext|>"We looked at nine studies involving 622 people. The studies were done in the community and lasted up to 24 weeks. Some studies compared CrP plus exercise with a placebo plus exercise, while others compared CrP alone to a placebo. We wanted to see which dose of CrP was most effective, but we also looked at the overall effect of CrP on body weight compared to a placebo. We found that CrP had a small effect on body weight after 12 to 16 weeks, but it's not clear if this is clinically significant. We couldn't find any evidence to support the use of CrP supplements for weight loss or to determine their safety."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 11 studies with 886 participants that compared different treatments for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. The studies were generally small and some did not provide clear data or analyses related to clinical outcomes, which reduced the quality of evidence. Two comparisons found no clear evidence of effects for different iodine preparations compared to no antiseptic treatment. One study found no clear difference in time to wound healing between a zinc oxide mesh dressing and a plain mesh dressing, but there was some evidence that the zinc oxide group had fewer wound infections. Another study found that sucralfate cream increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy compared to petrolatum cream, and Triclosan post-operative treatment reduced time to healing compared to a standard sodium hypochlorite solution. There was also moderate quality evidence that honey-soaked gauze and Dermacym®-treated post-operative foot wounds in people with diabetes were more effective than other treatments. However, the evidence was based on small studies and further research is needed to confirm these findings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at five studies involving 1049 women who underwent either amniocentesis or CVS and evaluated five different technique modifications. Three interventions were evaluated for amniocentesis, but none of them showed conclusive evidence of benefit. The same was found for terbutaline tocolysis and continuous vacuum aspiration during CVS. The evidence is not strong enough to change current clinical practice, so operators should continue to use familiar methods. High-quality randomized trials of technique modifications with adequate safety outcomes and power to detect important clinical differences would be welcome."<|endoftext|>"This text describes a review of 10 studies on the effects of fortifying wheat and maize flour with folic acid and other micronutrients. The studies were conducted in different countries and had varying durations. Most studies had unclear risk of bias. One non-RCT reported that wheat flour fortified with folic acid and other micronutrients was associated with lower occurrence of neural tube defects. Folic acid fortification may increase erythrocyte and serum/plasma folate concentrations, but evidence is limited for the effects on haemoglobin levels or anaemia. The review has limitations due to the small number of studies and participants, limitations in study design, and low-certainty of evidence. No adverse effects were reported."<|endoftext|>"Six trials were identified, but only two involving over a million neonates were eligible for inclusion. The study designs and outcomes varied, so only data from one study were analyzed. Screened participants had less severe malnutrition and better lung function parameters at age seven. Chest radiograph scores were also better at diagnosis, but over time, they became worse in the screened group. Screening for CF is less expensive than traditional diagnosis and provides potential for better pulmonary outcomes, but other factors can influence long-term prognosis."<|endoftext|>"We looked at five studies with a total of 7314 participants over an average of 4.5 years. One study compared the effects of lower blood pressure targets (less than 120 mmHg) to standard targets (less than 140 mmHg) in 4734 participants. The group with lower blood pressure had a lower risk of stroke, but there was no significant difference in mortality. Trying to achieve the lower blood pressure target led to more serious side effects. Four studies looked at the effects of lower diastolic blood pressure targets (less than 80 mmHg) compared to standard targets (less than 90 mmHg) in 2580 participants with diabetes. The group with lower diastolic blood pressure had a lower achieved blood pressure, but there was no significant difference in mortality, stroke, heart attack, or heart failure. There was not enough evidence to support lower blood pressure targets for people with high blood pressure and diabetes. More studies are needed to look at the effects on mortality, serious side effects, and cardiovascular and renal events."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 14 trials involving 709 participants. One study compared two types of casts and found no difference. Seven studies compared non-removable casts with removable pressure-relieving devices. In five of those studies, non-removable casts were better at healing ulcers than removable devices. Two studies found that non-removable casts were better than dressings alone. One study found that combining Achilles tendon lengthening with a non-removable cast was more effective than using a non-removable cast alone. Other treatments like surgical debridement, felt fitted to the foot, and felted foam dressings did not show a significant effect. Overall, non-removable, pressure-relieving casts are more effective in healing diabetes-related foot ulcers than removable casts or dressings alone."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses five studies that looked at different interventions for breast cancer survivors to improve cognitive function. The interventions included computer-assisted cognitive training, compensatory strategy training, meditation, and physical activity. The studies found that cognitive training and compensatory strategy training had positive effects on cognitive function and mental well-being. However, the evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions was unclear. The studies were rated as having a high risk of bias and the evidence was of low quality, so caution should be taken when interpreting the findings. Larger studies with appropriate control groups and consideration of functional outcomes are needed to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits of these interventions."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 12 records of six trials, but only included five trials from the 1970s with 343 participants. The methodology and data reporting of the trials were poor, and only short-term data were available. The results showed no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine in terms of global state improvement or change scores on the mental state scale. Both treatments had similar adverse effects, with around 60% of participants experiencing some sort of adverse effect and approximately 40% experiencing some parkinsonism-type movement disorder. No clear difference was observed in the number of participants leaving the study early for any reason. However, the evidence is of very low quality, and we cannot make firm conclusions based on such data. Clinicians and people with schizophrenia should be aware that there is no good quality evidence to base decisions, and more high-quality research is needed."<|endoftext|>"In this study, 207 participants were randomly assigned to either colorectal stenting or emergency surgery. The emergency surgery group had a higher success rate and shorter time to relief of obstruction. Stent insertion was successful in 86.02% of attempts, but there were some complications such as perforation, migration, and obstruction. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups. The use of stents resulted in shorter hospital stays, less blood loss, and shorter procedure times. However, more research with larger sample sizes and well-defined trial designs is needed to confirm these findings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at nine studies involving 1867 women to compare the effectiveness of human albumin, HES, and mannitol versus no treatment for preventing OHSS. The quality of evidence was low to moderate for all comparisons due to imprecision, poor reporting, and lack of blinding. Intravenous albumin was found to have a beneficial effect on OHSS, but it may reduce pregnancy rates. HES was also found to be effective in reducing OHSS, but there was no evidence of an effect on pregnancy rates. Mannitol was found to be effective in reducing OHSS, but there was no evidence of an effect on pregnancy rates. Adverse events were uncommon but not well reported. Overall, the evidence suggests that these plasma expanders can reduce rates of moderate and severe OHSS in high-risk women, but more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety."<|endoftext|>"Ten studies with 484 patients were reviewed to compare the effectiveness and patient satisfaction of different sclerosing agents for treating telangiectasias of the lower limbs. The evidence did not show that any one agent was more effective or satisfying than the others, but all agents were more effective than a normal saline placebo. Patients were less satisfied with the placebo. Some evidence suggested that higher concentrations of polidocanol and sodium tetradecyl sulfate caused more adverse reactions, and that STS was more painful than other agents. However, the available evidence was limited and of poor quality, so more research is needed to determine the best agent and dosing for optimal results and patient satisfaction. Future research should also include demographic data and symptom measures for better comparison."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed seven studies with 241 participants, but we couldn't do a meta-analysis because the treatments were too different and some studies didn't provide enough statistical information. Most studies didn't describe their allocation and blinding methodology well. None of the studies evaluated the effectiveness of drugs in preventing serious outcomes like death or heart arrhythmias, but some treatments were found to reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol, given through a nebulizer or inhaler, was effective in reducing serum potassium levels. The peak effect was seen at 120 minutes for 10 mg nebulized salbutamol and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulized salbutamol. One study found that 1.2 mg salbutamol via inhaler produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes. Salbutamol was found to be as effective as insulin-dextrose and more effective than bicarbonate. Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate and aminophylline. None of these treatments were studied in placebo-controlled studies. IV calcium and potassium binding resins were not evaluated in any of the studies. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such"<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 39 studies with 4216 participants, but only 30 studies with 3392 participants had enough data to be analyzed. Most of the studies had low or unclear risk of bias. The studies compared different types of solutions used to seal catheters for hemodialysis. Some solutions contained antibiotics, some contained other antimicrobial agents, and some contained both. The studies reported the incidence of catheter-related infections (CRI) and catheter thrombosis. The results suggest that antimicrobial lock solutions may reduce the risk of CRI, but there is little or no evidence that they reduce the risk of thrombosis. Antibiotic and combined lock solutions seem to be more effective at reducing CRI than non-antibiotic solutions, especially for tunnelled catheters. However, the evidence is not strong, and better-designed studies are needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of antimicrobial lock solutions."<|endoftext|>"We found 15 studies with a total of 1098 participants. Six studies compared pre-emptive treatment to no treatment or placebo, eight studies compared pre-emptive treatment to antiviral prophylaxis, and one study compared oral to intravenous pre-emptive treatment. Some studies had a low risk of bias, but blinding of participants and outcome assessment was not reported in any study. Pre-emptive treatment reduced the risk of CMV disease compared to no treatment or placebo, but did not affect acute rejection or all-cause mortality. Pre-emptive treatment and prophylaxis had similar effects on preventing CMV disease, but pre-emptive treatment caused less leucopenia. There were no significant differences in other adverse effects or risks. More studies are needed to determine the best way to prevent CMV disease in solid organ transplant recipients."<|endoftext|>"We found three studies that met our criteria. They were conducted by the same person and involved a total of 140 participants over six weeks to five months. The studies compared sweet potato preparations to a placebo for controlling blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. The studies had unclear or high risk of bias. However, the results showed that taking 4 g/day of sweet potato preparation for three to five months led to a statistically significant improvement in blood sugar control compared to the placebo. No serious side effects were reported, but other factors like quality of life and costs were not studied. Overall, there is not enough evidence to recommend sweet potato for treating type 2 diabetes, and more research is needed to determine its effectiveness and safety."<|endoftext|>"We found 62 studies, but only 19 of them met our criteria. Out of those 19, 5 were included in our analysis, with 192 participants. The other 14 studies didn't have enough information for us to assess them properly. The participants' ages ranged from 6 to 63 years old, and most of the studies didn't report on important quality factors. The active cycle of breathing technique was compared to other airway clearance therapies, and while some participants preferred one over the other, there wasn't a significant difference in outcomes like quality of life, lung function, or sputum weight. We need longer studies to better understand the effects of the active cycle of breathing technique on people with cystic fibrosis."<|endoftext|>"This study looked at 8 trials involving 733 women that compared a brief co-incubation method to the standard insemination protocol for IVF. Live birth rates were not reported. However, the study found that the brief co-incubation method was associated with higher ongoing and clinical pregnancy rates compared to the standard method. There was no significant difference in miscarriage rates between the two methods. More research is needed to determine if the brief co-incubation method leads to higher live birth rates and lower miscarriage rates."<|endoftext|>"In five studies involving 694 infants, it was found that using a long IT (inspiratory time) during ventilation increased the risk of air leaks and mortality before hospital discharge. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). It's important to note that these studies were conducted before the use of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant, and synchronised modes of ventilatory support. The participants mostly had a single pathology (HMD) and the effects of long IT on newborns ventilated for other reasons were not examined. Despite this, it's recommended that infants with poorly compliant lungs should be ventilated with a short IT to avoid the increased risk of air leaks and death associated with long IT."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 33 studies with 5110 patients, but most of them were of low quality. TFU has been used in many patient groups, but it was done in different ways (by different health professionals, at different frequencies, etc.) and measured different outcomes. The effects of TFU varied between studies and patient groups, and we could only combine a few outcomes due to the diversity of the studies. Some meta-analyses showed significant differences between studies. Overall, we cannot say for sure if TFU is effective because the studies had low quality and inconsistent results. No harmful effects were reported. While some studies showed positive effects, the results were not significantly different from the control groups."<|endoftext|>"We found 38 trials that looked at ways to improve retention. These trials used six different strategies, including incentives, communication, and management. Most of the trials focused on getting participants to complete questionnaires, either by mail or electronically. A few trials looked at keeping participants in the trial. The trials were done in different countries and settings. We found that offering monetary incentives increased the likelihood of participants returning questionnaires. Shorter questionnaires and disease-specific questions did not show clear benefits. Sending questionnaires by recorded delivery and using reminder letters seemed to be effective. Other strategies, such as non-monetary incentives and enhanced letters, did not show clear benefits. We need more research to evaluate case management and behavioral strategies. Overall, the findings of this review depend on the specific trial and its procedures."<|endoftext|>"We looked at eight studies with a total of 829 participants, split between two groups. We found six more studies that we haven't classified yet, and one study that's finished but not published. Seven studies gave us data on the main outcome, and eight studies gave us data on secondary outcomes. Unfortunately, many of the studies didn't report any events in either group, which made it hard to analyze the data. We didn't find any significant differences between the two devices in terms of mechanical ventilation failure. However, we did find that it took longer to establish an effective airway with one device, and that peak airway pressure was lower with the other device. We also found that one device made a better seal, but the other device was quicker to insert. We didn't find any important differences between the devices in terms of complications, but the quality of evidence was low. Overall, we're uncertain about the effects of either device on oxygenation or ventilation, and there were very few events to analyze."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 19 studies involving 1453 children from eight countries, aged 4-18 years, with gastrointestinal problems. Most studies used probiotics, fiber, low FODMAP, or fructose-restricted diets. Probiotics were found to reduce pain frequency and intensity in children at 0-3 months after treatment, and improve pain in those with irritable bowel syndrome. However, the quality of evidence was low to moderate. Fiber-based interventions did not show significant improvement in pain. There were not enough studies to assess other outcomes like school performance or quality of life. No major side effects were reported. Probiotics may be considered as part of a treatment plan, but more research is needed to determine the best strain and dosage, and to assess long-term effects. More high-quality studies are also needed for fiber and other dietary interventions."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 22 studies with 4490 participants, all of which were randomised trials. 19 of the studies had analysable outcome data, and 17 of them involved students. Most of the studies had unclear or high risk of bias, except for detection bias. The results from the five trials with discrimination outcomes were mixed, with some showing a reduction, increase, or no effect. The median standardised mean difference for the three trials with continuous outcomes was -0.25. Odds ratios for the two studies with dichotomous discrimination outcomes showed no evidence of effect. The 19 trials with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention, indicating that mass media interventions may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects, or other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects, and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review."<|endoftext|>"We analyzed 85 studies from 41 countries, including high-, middle-, and low-income countries, that explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women and healthcare providers. We developed 52 findings and organized them into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context, service design and provision, and what matters to women and staff. The third domain was further divided into two areas: personalized supportive care and information and safety. We found that women's perception of antenatal care (ANC) depends on their beliefs about pregnancy and local socio-cultural norms. The quality of ANC design and provision affects whether women continue to use ANC or not. Healthcare providers need sufficient resources, staffing, training, and education to provide high-quality, relationship-based, locally accessible ANC. This review identifies key barriers and facilitators to the uptake of ANC services and provides insights into why a particular type of ANC may or may not be acceptable, accessible, or valued by some pregnant women and their families/communities. The three thematic domains identified by the review should be considered for service development and improvement, with input from pregnant and postnatal women, community members, and other stakeholders."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 16 trials involving 3,361 patients with aneurysmal SAH. Calcium antagonists were found to reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia. Oral nimodipine alone was particularly effective. The evidence for other calcium antagonists and intravenous administration of nimodipine is not clear. Magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine showed some promise but more evidence is needed. Overall, oral nimodipine is currently recommended for patients with aneurysmal SAH due to its potential benefits and modest risks. Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists is not recommended based on the current evidence."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies with 739 children, all of which used one year as the age cut-off for pre-treatment risk stratification. One study had updated follow-up data, and another had an erratum. Myeloablative therapy was found to be better than conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment for event-free survival and overall survival, but the difference in overall survival was no longer significant when additional follow-up data was included. There were no significant differences in secondary malignant disease or treatment-related death between the treatment groups, but myeloablative therapy had higher rates of renal effects, interstitial pneumonitis, and veno-occlusive disease. No information on quality of life was reported, and the results for different subgroups were not consistent across all studies. Myeloablative therapy seems to work for event-free survival, but there is no evidence of effect for overall survival when additional follow-up data is included. More research is needed to identify the most optimal induction and/or myeloablative regimen, and future studies should be performed in homogeneous study populations with long-term follow-up. The relevance of these studies to current practice may be questioned due to changes in the age cut-off for high-risk disease."<|endoftext|>"We found eight clinical trials with a total of 632 participants that met our criteria. All eight trials had a high risk of bias, and the evidence was of low to very low certainty. The participants' ages ranged from 16 to 78 years, with 60% to 75% being men and 22% to 85% having stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The median follow-up duration was 12 months. TACE followed by 3-DCRT may have reduced all-cause mortality and the proportion of participants without tumour response compared to TACE alone, but the evidence was of low certainty. One trial showed that TACE followed by 3-DCRT may improve health-related quality of life, but the evidence was very low certainty. None of the trials reported serious adverse events, but the evidence on non-serious adverse events was of very low certainty. TACE followed by 3-DCRT may be associated with lower all-cause mortality and increased tumour response, but caution is needed due to the low-quality evidence. High-quality trials are needed to assess the role of TACE followed by 3-DCRT for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma."<|endoftext|>"No trials were found that directly compared increased versus standard energy intakes in infants with CLD/BPD. However, two excluded trials provided some insights into the topic. One study showed that infants with CLD/BPD who were fed formula enriched with protein and minerals had improved growth parameters up until the cessation of the intervention at three months of corrected age. The other study compared different energy density of formula but identical energy intake by setting different feed volumes for both groups. It showed that both groups were unable to achieve the pre-designated feed volumes and that there were no differences in growth, respiratory outcomes, oedema and the diuretic requirements. No randomised controlled trials are available that examine the effects of increased versus standard energy intake for preterm infants with (or developing) CLD/BPD. Research should be directed at evaluating the effects of various levels of energy intake on this group of infants on clinically important outcomes like mortality, respiratory status, growth and neurodevelopment. The benefits and harms of various ways of increasing energy intake, including higher energy density of milk feed and/or fluid volume, parenteral nutrition, and the use of various constituents of energy like carbohydrate, protein and fat for this purpose also need to be assessed."<|endoftext|>"Thirteen studies with 2341 participants and 2360 procedures met the criteria. The quality of evidence was generally low, with only a few outcomes having moderate or high quality evidence. Most trials had unclear risk of bias and there was significant heterogeneity among the studies. Two-dimensional ultrasound was found to reduce the risk of inadvertent arterial puncture and hematoma formation in subclavian vein cannulation, but there was no evidence of a difference in total or other complications. For femoral vein cannulation, ultrasound increased the likelihood of success on the first attempt and overall success rate, but there was no evidence of a difference in complications. Overall, two-dimensional ultrasound offers small gains in safety and quality compared to anatomical landmark techniques for central vein catheterization. However, data on insertion by inexperienced or experienced users, or on patients at high risk for complications, are lacking. The results for Doppler ultrasound techniques versus anatomical landmark techniques are uncertain."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses studies on the use of physostigmine for treating Alzheimer's disease. The studies used different methods of administering the drug, including intravenous infusion, conventional oral form, controlled-release oral form, and a verum skin patch. The results showed that the intravenous infusion trials had no usable results, and the trials of the conventional oral form showed no benefit compared to a placebo. The controlled-release physostigmine showed some improvement in cognitive scores compared to placebo, but there were also higher rates of adverse effects and withdrawal from the trial. The verum skin patch also had adverse effects and showed no significant improvement compared to placebo. Overall, the evidence for the effectiveness of physostigmine in treating Alzheimer's disease is limited, and adverse effects are common."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 13 trials with 16,112 participants. Most of the trials were for people with heart disease, but some were for people with a history of stroke or a mix of cardiovascular disease. We found that fibrates can help prevent non-fatal stroke, non-fatal heart attacks, and vascular death compared to a placebo. Fibrates were also somewhat effective in preventing heart attacks, but they did not help with all-cause mortality, death from vascular causes, or stroke events. When we excluded data from a drug called clofibrate, which is no longer used due to safety concerns, fibrates were no longer effective in preventing the primary composite outcome. However, they still helped prevent heart attacks. Fibrates did not cause more adverse events than the control group. Fibrates seemed to work well for people of different ages, genders, and with diabetes. Fibrates can be helpful in preventing non-fatal stroke, non-fatal heart attacks, and vascular death, but more research is needed to see if they work for people who have had a stroke and are already taking statins."<|endoftext|>"In twelve trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding, those who received tranexamic acid (TA) in addition to routine prophylactic uterotonics had less blood loss and fewer medical interventions compared to those who received a placebo or no intervention. The effect of TA was more pronounced in women who had vaginal birth than in those who had a cesarean section. Mild side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were more common with the use of TA. However, the effect of TA on serious side effects, maternal mortality, severe morbidity, and thromboembolic events is uncertain and requires further investigation."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 12 studies involving 2494 people, including 1586 children and 908 elderly, to see if amantadine and rimantadine were effective in treating influenza A compared to placebo, paracetamol, or zanamivir. Amantadine was found to be effective in preventing influenza A in children, but the quality of evidence was low and the safety of the drug was not well established. Rimantadine was helpful in reducing fever in children on day three of treatment, but again, the quality of evidence was moderate and the benefits were limited. Rimantadine did not show any prophylactic effect in the elderly. There was no evidence of adverse effects caused by treatment with either drug. Overall, the evidence and safety concerns do not support the use of amantadine and rimantadine for preventing, treating, or shortening the duration of influenza A in children and the elderly."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a review of nine trials involving 1512 women with unexplained infertility. Seven of the trials involved women undergoing IUI and two involved women trying to conceive through sexual intercourse. The trials compared intentional endometrial injury with no injury or a placebo procedure. The evidence suggests that endometrial injury may improve clinical pregnancy rates, but the quality of the evidence is low. The average pain experienced during the procedure was 6/10 on a visual analogue scale. There was no evidence of a difference in ongoing pregnancy rate or clinical pregnancy rate when comparing hysteroscopy with endometrial injury to hysteroscopy alone. When endometrial injury was performed in the cycle prior to IUI compared to the same cycle as the IUI, there was no evidence of a difference in ongoing pregnancy rate or clinical pregnancy rate. There was no evidence of an effect on miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or multiple pregnancy. The quality of the evidence was graded as low or very low due to a high risk of bias and low precision. Further well-conducted trials are needed to confirm or refute these findings."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four studies with 3905 participants, but they were all at high risk of bias. The studies compared professional oral care to usual oral care. One study with 834 participants was stopped early because there was no clear difference between the groups. We couldn't determine if professional oral care was better than usual oral care at reducing the incidence of pneumonia or first episodes of pneumonia. However, two studies showed that professional oral care may reduce the risk of pneumonia-associated mortality compared to usual oral care. We're not sure if professional oral care reduces all-cause mortality compared to usual care. Only one study looked at adverse effects and found no serious events, but there were 64 non-serious events like oral cavity disturbances and dental staining. No studies compared oral care to no oral care. The evidence for professional oral care reducing pneumonia mortality is low-quality and inconclusive for other outcomes. We need more trials to make reliable conclusions."<|endoftext|>"Five studies were included in this analysis, which compared different treatments for lymphocytic colitis. Budesonide was found to be more effective than placebo for inducing clinical and histological response. Mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may also be effective, but more research is needed to confirm this. The study on bismuth subsalicylate was of low quality and inconclusive due to a small sample size. Adverse events were reported in some studies. Overall, more research is needed to determine the best treatment options for lymphocytic colitis."<|endoftext|>"This text is about a review of twelve studies that looked at the effects of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) on patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin. The studies included 3259 patients and lasted from 6 to 12 months. Most of the studies had a low risk of bias. The review found that SMBG had a small effect on glycaemic control up to six months after initiation, but this effect subsided after 12 months. There was no evidence that SMBG affected patient satisfaction, general well-being, or general health-related quality of life. Two studies reported on the costs of self-monitoring, with one finding that it was 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose. More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes-specific quality of life and well-being, as well as its impact on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses 11 studies that looked at different psychological interventions for adults with AsPD (a personality disorder). However, only five studies had data available, and only two studies focused solely on AsPD. The studies looked at different outcomes, such as reconviction and aggression, and found that some interventions, such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and contingency management, were effective for improving outcomes related to substance misuse. However, there is not enough evidence to justify using any psychological intervention for adults with AsPD, and more research is needed."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 11 studies on antibiotics for the common cold and purulent rhinitis. Some studies only included certain groups of people and used different antibiotics and outcome measures. The combined data is limited and there was a moderate risk of bias. Antibiotics did not show any benefit for curing symptoms or persistence of symptoms compared to placebo. There was an increased risk of adverse effects in adults for both conditions and in all ages for acute purulent rhinitis. Therefore, antibiotics are not recommended for routine use for these conditions."<|endoftext|>"This text describes five trials that looked at the effects of different treatments for psoriasis. The trials involved a total of 162 participants, with ages ranging from 12 to 77 years. Only two participants were younger than 15 years. The trials varied in terms of where they were conducted and whether they were funded by a pharmaceutical company. The severity of psoriasis at the start of the trials also varied. Some participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. The trials did not measure the primary outcome of time-to-resolution or the secondary outcome of risk of relapse. The quality of the results was rated as very low due to bias and imprecision. The trials looked at the effects of penicillin, erythromycin, rifampicin, azithromycin, and tonsillectomy. Some trials did not measure the outcomes of interest, and adverse events were reported in some cases. The trials did not allow for investigation into the influence of Streptococcal infection, and a key intervention (amoxicillin) was not assessed. Further trials are needed to assess the efficacy and tolerance of penicillin V or amoxicillin in children and young adults with guttate psoriasis."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 12 studies with 933 people who have MS. Half were given vitamin D and half were given something else. Most of the studies used vitamin D₃, but one used vitamin D₂. After 52 weeks, we found that vitamin D did not make a difference in the number of relapses, disability, or MRI lesions. We also found that vitamin D did not cause any serious side effects. Some studies looked at quality of life and fatigue, but the results were mixed. We did not find any information on other important outcomes like hospitalization or cognitive function. Overall, we found very little evidence that vitamin D helps people with MS. However, more studies are being done that may give us more information in the future."<|endoftext|>"We found seven new studies and excluded six in this update. There are 62 studies with 4241 participants in this review. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor reporting of randomisation and allocation concealment. The primary outcomes were participant-reported pain and pain relief. Morphine is effective for cancer pain, and there was no difference in pain relief between modified release and immediate release versions. Adverse events were common, and some participants could not tolerate oral morphine. The quality of evidence is generally poor, and most trials had fewer than 100 participants. However, over 90% of participants had no worse than mild pain within a short time period. The review shows a wide range of study designs and inconsistency in cross-over designs. New studies added to the review reinforced the view that modified release morphine can be used to titrate to analgesic effect. There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses 14 trials that involved 1260 participants with trigger fingers. Most participants were women and their ages ranged from 16 to 88 years. The studies compared different treatments, including open surgery and steroid injections. The primary comparison was between open surgery and steroid injections, with open surgery being the most widely used treatment method. The studies found that open surgery had a lower recurrence rate but was more painful than steroid injections. However, the evidence was of low quality due to study design flaws. The studies did not report on hand function or participant satisfaction. Overall, the evidence suggests that open surgery may be more effective than steroid injections in reducing recurrence rates, but more research is needed to confirm this."<|endoftext|>"Three studies with a total of 931 participants tested different treatments before surgery for a type of brain tumor. The studies did not keep the participants or personnel unaware of which treatment they were receiving, which could affect the results. One study found that combining radiation therapy and chemotherapy improved overall survival compared to radiation therapy alone. Certain genetic markers were found to be associated with better outcomes in some of the studies. Early chemotherapy before or after radiation therapy may also improve survival. However, the chemotherapy used in the studies caused significant side effects, and it is unclear if a different type of chemotherapy could be used instead. Future studies should evaluate these genetic markers and consider using a different type of chemotherapy."<|endoftext|>"We studied five trials with 240 children aged one to 18 years who had mild to moderate OSA. The trials were done in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres and lasted from six weeks to four months. Three trials compared intranasal steroids to placebo, and two trials compared oral montelukast to placebo. We excluded one trial from the analysis because the patients were not analysed randomly, and we had concerns about selective reporting in another trial. We found that oral montelukast was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. However, we are uncertain about the effectiveness of intranasal corticosteroids. Adverse events were rare and minor, and there is not enough evidence to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children. Future studies should investigate the sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment, and long-term safety of anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of OSA in children."<|endoftext|>"Several studies were conducted to investigate the prevention of VTE in children with different treatments such as LMWH, AT supplementation, low-dose warfarin, cryoprecipitate, and FFP supplementation. However, there were no significant effects of these treatments in preventing VTE or adverse events compared to no intervention. One study showed a reduction in symptomatic VTE with the addition of LMWH to AT supplementation. More well-designed studies are needed to explore the effects of systemic treatments in preventing VTE. It may be necessary to select participants with thrombotic risk factors or investigate asymptomatic VTE instead."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses three trials involving a total of 287 participants who had surgery for Type I or II TAAA. The first trial showed that CSFD did not significantly prevent neurological deficits in the lower extremities. The second trial, which used a combination of CSFD and intrathecal papaverine, showed a statistically significant reduction in postoperative neurological deficits. The third trial showed that CSFD resulted in an 80% reduction in the relative risk of postoperative deficits. However, there is limited data supporting the role of CSFD in thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery for prevention of neurological injury, and further studies are needed."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 13 studies with 662 participants and focused on four main outcomes: participant-rated improvement, percentage of participants with a 75% or greater reduction in PASI score, withdrawal due to side effects, and clearance rate. In one study, there was no significant difference in PASI 75 between NB-UVB and oral PUVA. In three other studies, oral PUVA was more effective in clearing CPP than NB-UVB. Withdrawals due to side effects were similar in both groups. Results for clearance rate in CPP were inconsistent between NB-UVB and bath PUVA. In PPP, NB-UVB and topical PUVA had similar clearance rates. Re-NB-UVB and re-PUVA were equally effective for CPP and GP. NB-UVB was similar to selective BB-UVB for CPP. More studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of NB-UVB."<|endoftext|>"We found 21 studies with 1525 participants. About half of the studies had low risk of bias. Some small studies showed that adding biofeedback to exercises or electrical stimulation improved continence. Adding electrical stimulation to biofeedback was also effective. Sacral nerve stimulation was better than conservative management. There was not enough evidence to compare different methods of biofeedback or exercises. Rectal volume discrimination training may improve continence. However, the limited number of studies and methodological weaknesses do not allow for a definitive assessment of the role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy in managing faecal incontinence. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to draw safe conclusions."<|endoftext|>"39 small to moderate quality trials were reviewed, with limited data on outcomes and wide confidence intervals. Using a urinary catheter post-surgery tended to result in a lower risk of recatheterisation, but there was imprecise data on urinary tract infections. Urethral catheterisation post-surgery resulted in a higher risk of recatheterisation compared to suprapubic catheterisation. Removing the catheter earlier tended to result in fewer urinary tract infections. Clamp and release policies before catheter removal resulted in a higher incidence of urinary tract infections and delayed return to normal voiding. Due to the small size and low quality of the trials, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on which policy to use, as it involves a trade-off between the risks of morbidity and recatheterisation."<|endoftext|>"Ten studies with 3340 participants were reviewed. Aripiprazole was compared to placebo in seven studies, and to valproate, lithium, and haloperidol in two studies each. Aripiprazole was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms at three and four weeks, but not at six weeks. However, aripiprazole caused more movement disorders and gastrointestinal disturbances than placebo. When compared to other drugs, aripiprazole did not show significant differences in reducing manic symptoms. Haloperidol caused more movement disorders than aripiprazole at 12 weeks, while lithium did not show significant differences. Aripiprazole is effective in treating mania in adults, children, and adolescents, but its place in therapy is still unclear due to limited comparative trials."<|endoftext|>"Two studies evaluated using urokinase or ethanol locks with systemic antibiotics compared to systemic antibiotics alone in treating CVC-related infections in children with cancer. No studies were found that evaluated antibiotic locks alone. The studies had limitations and varied in their methods. There was no significant difference found between the groups in terms of cure rates, recurrent infections, time until negative blood culture, premature CVC removal, ICU admission, or sepsis. No adverse events were reported in the cohort studies, but CVC malfunctioning was reported in some. More well-designed studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of lock treatments for CVC-related infections in children with cancer."<|endoftext|>"Out of 15 trials, only three had low risk of bias. Three themes emerged from the trials related to education on whiplash pain. One trial with 348 participants showed that an educational video on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain compared to no treatment at intermediate-term, but not at long-term follow-up. Another trial with 102 participants showed that a whiplash pamphlet on activation advice was less beneficial for pain reduction and did not improve function or global perceived improvement compared to generic information given out in emergency care. Nine trials using diverse educational approaches showed no evidence of benefit or difference for varied outcomes. Three trials with 243 participants showed no difference in treatment or favored other treatments for pain and stress coping skills and workplace ergonomics. One trial with 192 participants favored specific exercise training for chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up. One trial with 58 participants showed that self-care strategies did not relieve pain for acute to chronic neck pain at short-term follow-up. Overall, this review did not show effectiveness for educational interventions, including advice on activation, stress-coping skills, workplace ergonomics, and self-care strategies. Future research should be based on sound adult learning theory and skill acquisition."<|endoftext|>"No studies met the criteria for inclusion in the Cochrane review. However, 49 studies and pieces of literature that met the same criteria were found from other sources and used to create a thematic synthesis. The synthesis suggests that effective communication should be a coordinated, tailored, and responsive program that includes education and monitoring of access to healthcare for those at risk. Poor communication practices can have negative impacts, such as discrimination in accessing healthcare. There is not enough evidence to determine the best approach to communication in situations where people are at risk of CJD or vCJD. The thematic synthesis can be used to inform policy and practice decisions for communicating with people at risk in the absence of rigorous evaluative studies."<|endoftext|>"We looked at one study that compared opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) to a placebo for treating RSL symptoms. After 12 weeks, the drug group had better improvements in RSL symptoms, drug response, remission, quality of life, and sleep adequacy and quantity. However, there were more adverse events reported in the drug group, including gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and headache. This conclusion is based on only one study with a high dropout rate, so more research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of opioids for treating RSL symptoms."<|endoftext|>"This text talks about 15 different studies that involved over 1000 adults with wrist fractures. The studies compared using a cast to using a device called external fixation to keep the bones in place. The studies had some weaknesses, like not hiding which treatment the patients were getting and not measuring outcomes well. External fixation was better at keeping the bones in place and preventing problems like the bones moving again or healing in the wrong position. However, external fixation had more complications, like infections. The studies didn't show a clear difference in serious complications between the two treatments. Overall, external fixation seems to be a good option for these types of fractures, but more research is needed to know if it's better for patients in the long run."<|endoftext|>"We analyzed five studies with a total of 1127 patients. The studies had low or unclear risk of bias and used a prospective randomized design to answer the research question. It is unclear whether removing stents early or late improves the incidence of MUC. However, removing stents early may reduce the incidence of UTI, especially if a BI stent is used. There was no discernible difference in UTI incidence between early and late removal if an externalized PU stent was used. We did not find any data on health economics or quality of life outcomes. In summary, early removal of ureteric stents after kidney transplantation may reduce the incidence of UTI, but it is uncertain if there is a higher risk of MUC. Using BI stents is the best way to achieve this benefit."<|endoftext|>"We looked at five studies that compared different dental treatments. Four studies compared crowns to fillings, with two comparing different types of crowns and two comparing crowns fitted using different techniques. One study compared crowns to non-restorative caries treatment. We only considered outcomes reported within 24 hours of the appointment or in the short term (less than 12 months) or long term (12 months or more). Some outcomes of interest were not measured in the studies, such as time to restoration failure, patient satisfaction, and costs.

The evidence suggests that crowns placed on primary molar teeth with carious lesions or following pulp treatment are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may also reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings. However, there is uncertainty about the risk of gingival bleeding when using crowns rather than fillings.

There is very low-quality evidence for crowns compared to non-restorative caries treatment and for metal compared with aesthetic crowns. No randomized controlled trials compare crowns fitted conventionally versus using the Hall Technique."<|endoftext|>"28 studies were reviewed, involving 788 children and adults. Most studies did not provide enough detail to perform a meta-analysis. In 22 studies, PEP was performed using a mask, in three studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips, and in three studies it was unclear which device was used. PEP was compared to other airway clearance techniques, and the primary outcome was forced expiratory volume in one second. Short-term studies showed little or no difference in effect between PEP and other methods, but long-term studies had conflicting results. PEP was found to be more effective than other techniques in reducing respiratory exacerbations when used with a mask for at least one year. Participant preference was in favor of PEP. Limited evidence was reported on adverse events. The review suggests that all techniques and devices may have a place in the clinical treatment of people with CF. PEP using a mask was found to be more effective than HFCWO in reducing pulmonary exacerbations. Airway clearance techniques should be individualized according to patient preferences and pulmonary symptoms."<|endoftext|>"In four studies, 1485 participants with moderate to severe Crohn's disease were analyzed. All studies included patients with active Crohn's disease and most were adults over 18 years old. One study had a higher risk of bias than the others. CZP was found to be more effective than a placebo in achieving clinical remission and clinical response at week 8. CZP was also associated with a slightly higher risk of serious adverse events, but the difference was not statistically significant. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of CZP in Crohn's disease patients."<|endoftext|>"112 studies were selected, with 15 being about adults with CKD, 16 providing subgroup data for people with CKD, and 81 including individuals with CKD but without data for this subgroup. The risk of bias was high or unclear in all studies. 26 studies with extractable data on outcomes were included in the meta-analyses. The effects of various treatments on heart failure outcomes were uncertain due to sparse data or low certainty evidence. There is insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice, and future research is needed to explore the effect of treatments on subgroups of patients with CKD."<|endoftext|>"This text discusses three studies involving a total of 1945 women. The studies had mixed results in terms of bias. No serious complications or deaths occurred in the trials. The neonatal outcomes were not statistically different between groups. There was no significant difference in the risk of instrumental delivery or hyperstimulation between the two types of monitoring (internal or external tocodynamometry). Based on these three studies, there is not enough evidence to recommend one form of tocodynamometry over another for women who receive intravenous oxytocin for labor induction or augmentation."<|endoftext|>"We looked at two studies with 54 participants who had CVI. Some outcomes were not reported or were only reported in one study. The studies used different scales to measure disease symptoms, so we couldn't combine the data. One study found no difference between the exercise and control groups, while the other found a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. The exercise group in one study had better ejection fraction, venous refilling time, and peak torque at fast speed compared to the control group. Quality of life, ankle range of motion, venous leg ulcers, surgical intervention, and exercise capacity were not assessed in either study. Both studies were rated as having a high risk of bias, so the results should be interpreted carefully. Overall, there is not enough evidence to determine if physical exercise is effective for people with CVI. Future research should consider exercise protocols, sample size, blinding, and disease severity."<|endoftext|>"76 trials were identified, with a median quality score of 3. Follow-up periods varied from the day of the last injection to eighteen months. The trials compared different treatments for knee osteoarthritis, including hyaluronan/hylan, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, exercise, arthroscopy, and conventional treatment. The analysis showed that viscosupplements (hyaluronan/hylan) were effective in reducing pain and improving function, especially at the 5 to 13 week post-injection period. The efficacy of different products varied, and there were few head-to-head comparisons. The safety of the products was not definitively established due to sample size restrictions, but no major safety issues were detected. Overall, the analysis supports the use of viscosupplements in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed ten clinical trials with 4052 participants to see if misoprostol provided any additional benefit for treating primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) when used with other uterotonics. Four trials showed that misoprostol did not provide any additional benefit for maternal mortality, serious maternal morbidity, admission to intensive care, or hysterectomy. Two trials compared sublingual misoprostol to oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment and found no difference in primary outcomes, but women given misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss. Misoprostol also caused vomiting and shivering. Two trials tested estrogen and tranexamic acid, but were too small for meaningful comparisons. One trial tested lower segment compression, but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes. No trials evaluated surgical or radiological interventions for women unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics. Oxytocin infusion is more effective and causes fewer side effects than misoprostol as first-line therapy for primary PPH. Misoprostol and oxytocin worked similarly when used after prophylactic uterotonics. Misoprostol did not provide any added benefit when used with oxytocin. Further evaluation"<|endoftext|>"Six trials met the requirements for entry. Most patients in these trials were born prematurely. Five small trials looked at short-term cysteine supplementation in cysteine-free PN. One large multicenter RCT looked at short-term N-acetylcysteine supplementation in cysteine-containing PN for infants weighing less than or equal to 1000 grams. Cysteine supplementation did not significantly affect growth or the risk of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis requiring surgery, periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, or severe intraventricular hemorrhage. However, it did increase nitrogen retention in four trials and plasma levels of cysteine. N-acetylcysteine supplementation did not significantly affect any of the risks mentioned above. Evidence suggests that short-term cysteine chloride supplementation of cysteine-free PN in preterm infants can improve nitrogen balance, but there is not enough evidence to assess the risks of cysteine supplementation, especially metabolic acidosis. Evidence does not support routine N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants."<|endoftext|>"We found 77 trials with 6287 participants that met the review's criteria. Only one trial had low risk of bias, while the others had high risk of bias. The evidence quality was very low. 35 trials had participants with non-alcohol related steatohepatitis (NASH), 5 trials had participants with diabetes mellitus, and 14 trials had participants without diabetes mellitus. The follow-up period ranged from one to 24 months. We only present the comparisons of active intervention versus no intervention where two or more trials reported mortality, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. Antioxidants and bile acids did not show any difference in mortality, serious adverse events, or health-related quality of life compared to no intervention. Thiazolidinediones also did not show any difference in mortality or serious adverse events compared to no intervention. 26 trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies that would benefit from the results, while 12 trials did not receive any additional funding or were funded by parties with no vested interest in the results. Due to the very low quality evidence, further well-designed clinical trials with large sample sizes are necessary to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for people with NAFLD, including those with steatohepatitis."<|endoftext|>"1282 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were identified in 15 studies, with 1172 having usable data. 430 participants developed Alzheimer's disease dementia and 130 developed other forms of dementia during the follow-up period, which ranged from less than one year to over four years. The accuracy of CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau, and CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio were evaluated in several studies, with varying sensitivity and specificity values. The studies had poor reporting and methodological quality, and there was heterogeneity in the reference standards, participant sampling, and study quality. The value of CSF testing for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice is uncertain, and there is a risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia. These tests may be more useful in ruling out Alzheimer's disease than in ruling it in. Future studies with more uniform approaches may provide a more accurate estimate."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies with 170 male participants who were having robotic surgery for prostate cancer. We found that there was no significant difference in pain between two types of anesthesia. However, propofol may help reduce nausea and vomiting after surgery and prevent an increase in eye pressure during surgery. We don't know if there are any negative effects or if one type of anesthesia is better than the other. The studies were small and of low quality, and only included men having prostate surgery. There is an ongoing study that may provide more information in the future."<|endoftext|>"We added 7 new studies to our update, bringing the total to 14 studies with over 1.6 million participants. Most studies found no link between pregnant women using topical corticosteroids and negative pregnancy outcomes. We looked at different outcomes, including mode of delivery, birth defects, low birth weight, preterm delivery, fetal death, and low Apgar score. We also looked at the potency of the corticosteroids used. We found no link between any potency of topical corticosteroids and negative pregnancy outcomes, except for a possible link between using potent to very potent corticosteroids and low birth weight. However, the evidence for this is not strong. We used a grading system to rate the quality of the evidence, which was generally low. Overall, this update supports the previous findings that there is no link between using topical corticosteroids during pregnancy and negative outcomes."<|endoftext|>"We found four studies that met the criteria for this review. They involved a total of 611 participants (612 eyes) from different countries and compared the use of corticosteroids to treat bacterial keratitis with no use of corticosteroids. The studies had follow-up periods ranging from two months to one year and reported on visual acuity, time to re-epithelialization, and adverse events. None of the studies found any significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual acuity or adverse events. One study found that the use of corticosteroids slowed down the time to re-epithelialization, but another larger study did not find any significant difference. One study reported on quality of life, but there was no difference between the two groups. However, all studies had significant losses to follow-up and were underpowered to detect treatment differences. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to support the use of corticosteroids for treating bacterial keratitis."<|endoftext|>"We looked at four trials with 450 participants. Out of those, we had data on functional outcome and death for 443 participants from three trials. We found that percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome compared to intravenous thrombolytic therapy. There was also a non-significant increase in the proportion of participants who died in the percutaneous vascular intervention group. We did not find a difference in the proportion of participants with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages between the intervention and control groups. We did not have enough data on vascular status to make any conclusions. Overall, we did not find evidence that percutaneous vascular interventions are better than intravenous thrombolytic treatment for ischaemic stroke. More trials are needed because new techniques and devices are being developed."<|endoftext|>"We reviewed one trial with 120 families and 143 children. The study had a high risk of bias because some control group participants used day care services outside of the study. The study found no evidence that center-based day care improved or worsened children's cognitive or psychosocial development compared to care at home. The study also found no evidence that center-based day care improved or worsened parents' employment or household income. The study did not report on long-term outcomes for children. Overall, there is not enough evidence to provide guidance on the effects of day care for children under five in high-income countries. More studies are needed to compare different types of day care arrangements."<|endoftext|>"A total of 126 reports were found during the screening process, describing 30 scoring indices. Out of these, 11 scoring indices have been validated in some way. Eight scoring indices were assessed for intra-rater reliability, while all 11 were evaluated for inter-rater reliability. Three indices underwent content validation, two assessed criterion validity, six explored content validity, and two were tested for responsiveness. The Nancy Index and the Robarts Histopathology Index have undergone the most validation, but none of the available histologic scoring indices have been fully validated. More research is needed to determine the optimal endpoint for histologic healing in UC, and the optimal index would need to be fully validated."<|endoftext|>"We looked at three studies that compared intramedullary nailing to plating in 213 participants, with usable data from 173 participants, of whom 112 were male. The quality of evidence was rated as very low for all outcomes, meaning we are unsure about the estimates. The results showed a small difference in favor of nailing for foot and ankle function, but it was unlikely to be clinically important. Nailing was favored for the need for reoperation or physiotherapy for adverse events, but there was a possibility of a better outcome after plating. Evidence showed no clinically important difference in pain between the two groups. Overall, there is not enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. More research is needed to identify priority questions."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 11 studies with a total of 38,742 participants. Eight studies compared BPLDs to no treatment or a placebo, and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets. The quality of the studies varied. BPLDs were found to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, but not major vascular events or dementia. Participants using an ACE inhibitor or diuretic had a lower risk of recurrent stroke. There is not enough evidence to determine the best systolic blood pressure target after a stroke or TIA."<|endoftext|>"519 men from 4 randomized, double-blind trials lasting 4 to 26 weeks were evaluated. B-sitosterols, both non-glucosidic and 100% B-sitosteryl-B-D-glucoside, improved urinary symptoms and flow measures. However, they did not significantly reduce prostate size compared to placebo. Withdrawal rates for B-sitosterol and placebo were similar. Non-glucosidic B-sitosterols appear to improve urinary symptoms and flow measures, but their long-term effectiveness, safety, and ability to prevent BPH complications are unknown."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing it to salbutamol. The trials involved 62,815 people with asthma, including 2,599 children. In six trials, no serious adverse events were reported. Regular salmeterol was associated with a slightly higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to placebo, but the increase was not significant. Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly higher with regular salmeterol compared to placebo. One extra serious adverse event occurred for every 188 people treated with regular salmeterol. There was not enough evidence to determine if the risk in children was higher or lower than in adults. There was no significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events when regular salmeterol was compared to regular salbutamol. However, in patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids, regular salmeterol was associated with a significant increase in the risk of asthma-related death. The risk was smaller in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids, but the data was not conclusive. The effects of regular salmeterol in children are uncertain due to the small number of children studied."<|endoftext|>"Two studies looked at preterm infants with respiratory distress. One study gave L-thyroxine to some infants and the other study gave L-triiodothyronine to some infants, while others received no treatment. Both studies had some issues with how they were conducted, such as not randomly assigning patients and not blinding treatment or measurement. Neither study found any significant benefits in reducing illness or death from using thyroid hormones. When the studies were combined and analyzed, there was no significant difference in mortality or other health outcomes between those who received thyroid hormones and those who did not. Overall, there is no evidence that giving thyroid hormones to preterm infants with respiratory distress reduces the severity of their illness or improves their chances of survival."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 38 studies with a total of 1828 people. Eight of these studies had a low risk of bias when it came to assessing mortality, but all of them had a high risk of bias for other outcomes. When we analyzed the data, we found that non-absorbable disaccharides were better than placebo or no treatment for reducing mortality and improving hepatic encephalopathy. We also found that non-absorbable disaccharides could help reduce serious adverse events associated with liver disease. There was some evidence that non-absorbable disaccharides could improve quality of life, but the evidence was not strong. Non-absorbable disaccharides were associated with some non-serious side effects. We did not find any differences between lactulose and lactitol for the outcomes we looked at. Overall, non-absorbable disaccharides may be helpful for people with hepatic encephalopathy."<|endoftext|>"This update looked at 65 studies involving 3598 participants, with 45 studies contributing data to the analysis. The treatments included bisphosphonates, vitamin D compounds, teriparatide, denosumab, cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy, and calcitonin. The studies evaluated bone density, bone-related biomarkers, proteinuria, and hyperparathyroidism. Bisphosphonate therapy may prevent fractures in transplant recipients, but the evidence is uncertain. Bisphosphonate therapy may also decrease acute graft rejection and bone pain, but may increase the risk of hypocalcaemia. The evidence for other treatments is of very low certainty. The effects of bone treatment for children and adolescents after kidney transplantation are very uncertain."<|endoftext|>"In four trials with 317 people, magnesium was studied for the treatment or prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Three trials used oral magnesium with different doses, and one trial used parenteral magnesium. Each trial had some risk of bias and there were differences in how the trials were conducted. None of the studies measured all of the primary outcomes and objectives of the review. Only one trial measured clinical symptoms and handgrip strength was the only outcome that could be analyzed across three trials. There was no significant increase in handgrip strength in the magnesium group and no important adverse events were reported. Overall, there is not enough evidence to determine if magnesium is helpful or harmful for alcohol withdrawal syndrome."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 15 trials with 3057 participants. 10 of these trials were in our 2012 review, and 5 were from merging two reviews. We didn't find any new studies for this update. The risk of bias was low overall. Without antibiotics, 46% of people with rhinosinusitis were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can help people get better faster, but only a small number of people will benefit. Antibiotics can also cause side effects, and there is a risk of antibiotic resistance. We don't recommend antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We don't have enough information to make recommendations for children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis because they weren't included in the studies we looked at."<|endoftext|>"Eight studies involving 2515 patients were included in this analysis. Three studies from Asian countries compared D3 and D2 lymphadenectomy and found no significant difference in overall survival or postoperative mortality. Only one study had data on disease-free survival and none had data on disease-specific survival. Five studies (3 from Europe and 2 from Asia) compared D2 and D1 lymphadenectomy and found no significant difference in overall or disease-free survival. However, D2 lymphadenectomy was associated with better disease-specific survival, although it also had a higher postoperative mortality rate. Overall, D2 lymphadenectomy may improve disease-specific survival in patients with stomach cancer, but the increased risk of postoperative mortality should be considered."<|endoftext|>"This review looked at 13 studies with 1158 participants comparing naltrexone to placebo or no medication, psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, and buprenorphine for treating opioid dependence. The only statistically significant difference in favor of naltrexone was a lower re-incarceration rate, but this was only seen in two studies. When looking at studies where patients were forced to adhere to treatment, naltrexone was found to be better for retention and abstinence. However, there was no significant difference between naltrexone and psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, or buprenorphine for retention, abstinence, or side effects. The review concludes that there is not enough evidence to say that naltrexone is a superior treatment for opioid dependence compared to other treatments."<|endoftext|>"No studies on modifying food met the criteria, but two studies on modifying fluids were included. Both studies were part of the same large trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. The first study looked at the effects of different viscosities of liquids on aspiration in 351 participants with dementia using videofluoroscopy. The second study compared the effects of nectar and honey thick liquids with a chin down head posture over a three-month period in a subgroup of 260 participants with dementia. Honey thick liquids showed a more positive impact on immediate elimination of aspiration during videofluoroscopy, but had more adverse effects in the second follow-up study. There were more incidents of pneumonia in participants receiving honey thick liquids than those receiving nectar thick liquids or taking regular liquids with a chin down posture. The quality of evidence for outcomes in this review is low, and further high-quality clinical trials are required."<|endoftext|>"Six studies involving 788 women compared natural cycle IVF to standard IVF. The largest study included 396 women. The results showed no significant difference in live birth rates between the two methods. For a woman with a 53% chance of live birth using standard IVF, the chance using natural cycle IVF would range from 34% to 53%. There was also no significant difference in rates of OHSS, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, gestational abnormalities, or cycle cancellations. One study found that the oocyte retrieval rate was lower in the natural cycle group. The evidence was limited by imprecision and more data is needed. Future studies should compare natural cycle IVF to standard IVF and include cumulative live birth and pregnancy rates, treatment costs, and adverse effects."<|endoftext|>"We analyzed 12 studies with a total of 984 participants, focusing only on those involved in Tai Chi and the control group (811 participants). The studies had different sample sizes and mean ages, and the programs lasted from six weeks to one year. All studies were RCTs, and some used specific statistical approaches. No adverse events were reported. We compared Tai Chi to usual care, Tai Chi and breathing exercise to breathing exercise alone, and Tai Chi and exercise to exercise alone. Tai Chi showed better results in six-minute walk distance and pulmonary function compared to usual care, but its effects on dyspnoea level and quality of life were inconclusive. Tai Chi did not show superiority when compared to other interventions. Tai Chi is safe to practice. Future studies are needed to determine the most beneficial Tai Chi style and number of forms."<|endoftext|>"We looked at 72 trials with 2470 participants, including 35 new studies. The studies had small sample sizes and used different virtual reality devices and treatments. Many studies had unclear bias due to poor reporting, so the evidence quality is mostly low. Control groups received no intervention or standard-care therapy. Virtual reality did not significantly improve upper limb function compared to conventional therapy, but it did when used in addition to usual care. There were no significant effects on gait speed or balance, but there was a significant improvement in activities of daily living. There were few adverse events reported. Time since stroke, severity of impairment, and type of device did not strongly influence outcomes. Higher dose and customized programs showed a trend towards better outcomes, but this was not statistically significant."<|endoftext|>"We found five studies with a total of 1330 participants that met our criteria. None of the studies looked at treatments shorter than six months. In one study with 174 participants, levofloxacin was added to the standard treatment, but we don't know if it had an effect on relapse, treatment failure, death, sputum conversion, or adverse events. In three studies with 723 participants, ethambutol was replaced with moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, or ofloxacin in the standard treatment, but we don't know if this had an effect on relapse, treatment failure, death, sputum conversion, or adverse events. In one study with 433 participants, moxifloxacin was substituted for isoniazid, but we don't know if this had an effect on treatment failure, relapse, death, sputum conversion, or adverse events. There are currently six studies in progress testing shorter treatments with fluoroquinolones, but there is not enough evidence to determine if adding or substituting fluoroquinolones in the first-line treatment reduces death or relapse, or increases culture conversion at eight weeks. Larger studies are currently in progress."<|endoftext|>
