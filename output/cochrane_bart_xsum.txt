This review found that children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can be more likely to be admitted to hospital. There is uncertainty as to the long-term effect of education on other outcomes such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function.
We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants were randomised to receive ketamine or a placebo (a dummy treatment). Ketamine reduced opioid use over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents, compared with placebo. Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours, and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm. The time for the first postoperative analgesic request was reduced by 54 minutes, and the area of postoperative hyperalgesia reduced by 7 cm². Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event. There was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. We downgraded the quality of evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400.
This review found five trials of MSP/RESA vaccine with 217 participants. All five reported on safety, and two on efficacy. No severe or systemic adverse effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 µg of each antigen (39 to 45 µg total). One small efficacy trial with 17 non-immune participants with blood-stage parasites showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge. In the second efficacy trial in 120 children aged five to nine years in Papua New Guinea, episodes of clinical malaria were not reduced, but MSP andRESA significantly reduced parasite density only in children who had not been pretreated with an antimalarial drug (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine). Infections with the 3D7 parasite subtype of the MSP2 (the variant included in the vaccine) were reduced, while those with the other main subtype, FC27, were not (720 children).
This review found four studies involving 125 participants. Three studies evaluated the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields and one study, capacitive coupled electric fields. Participants with delayed union and non-union of the long bones were included, but most data related to the tibia. Although all studies were blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials, each study had limitations. The overall pooled effect size was small and not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 4.48; 4 trials). There was substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity in this pooled analysis (I2 = 58%). A sensitivity analysis conducted to determine the effect of multiple follow-up time-points on the heterogeneity amongst the studies showed that the effect size remained non-significant at 24 weeks. There was no reduction in pain found in two trials. One trial reported two minor complications resulting from treatment. More definitive conclusions on treatment effect await further well-conducted randomised controlled trials.
This review found that there is currently no evidence to support the routine use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information. The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0%. There was no significant difference between the drain group (1/840) (adjusted proportion: 0.1%) and the 'no drain' group (2/841) (0.2%) (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.37) in short-term mortality in the ten trials with 1681 participants reporting on this outcome. The percentage of patients who developed serious adverse events in the seven trials with 1143 participants reporting this outcome or in the number of serious side effects in each group reported by eight trials with 1286 participants reported by a total of 1.5 events per 100 participants). This trial did not provide any information from which the standard deviation could be imputed and so the confidence intervals could not be calculated for these outcomes.
Forty-nine randomised controlled trials involving 3639 participants were included in this review. Thirty-eight different herbal medicines were tested in these trials, including four single herbs (extracts from a single herb), eight traditional Chinese patent medicines, and 26 self concocted Chinese herbal compound prescriptions. The trials reported on global symptom improvement (including improvement in numbness or pain) and changes in nerve conduction velocity. There was inadequate reporting on adverse events in the included trials. Two trials reported adverse events: adverse events occurred in the control group in one trial, and in the other it was unclear in which group the side effects occurred. 29 trials did not mention whether they monitored adverse events. Most of the trials were of very low methodological quality and therefore the interpretation of any positive findings for the efficacy of the included Chinese herbal medicines for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy should be made with caution.
We found five randomized controlled trials involving 1382 patients. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA ≥ 10 ng/mL) between IAS and CAS for Gleason scores 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. One trial found no difference in adverse effects (gastrointestinal, gynecomastia and asthenia), with the exception of impotence, which was significantly lower in the IAS group. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles.
This review found that insertion of an IUD immediately after abortion was associated with a higher risk of expulsion compared to delayed insertion of IUD. In other studies, adding copper sleeves to the Lippes Loop improved efficacy and reduced expulsion rates. However, at six months postabortion, IUD use is higher following immediate insertion.
We included only one small trial published as an abstract article. Ninety-one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the trial throughout the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found a high risk for attrition bias and unclear risk for reporting bias, performance and detection bias because of missing data due to abstract publication only, thus we judged the overall risk of bias as high.
We identified three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The included trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine). Of the vaccine recipients, the majority only had mild disease (with fewer than 50 skin lesions). In the three trials, most participants received PEP within three days following exposure; too few participants were vaccinated four to five days post-exposure to ascertain the efficacy of vaccine given more than three days after exposure. No included trial reported on adverse events following immunisation.
We included 12 trials with 4704 participants. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different antibiotic regimens. There was no sufficient clinical similarity between the trials to perform a meta-analysis. The overall all-cause mortality in four trials that reported mortality was 14/1401 (1.0%) and there were no significant differences in mortality between the intervention and control groups in each of the individual comparisons. None of the trials reported quality of life, total length of hospital stay or the use of healthcare resources. The exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery. There were no antibiotic-related serious adverse events in any of the 561 people randomised to the seven different antibiotic regimen (three trials reported mortality and one other trial). In the single trial that compared an antibiotic regimen with placebo, the proportion of people who developed SSIs was significantly lower in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav (or cefotaxime if allergic to penicillin) compared with placebo (all SSI: RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.65). In two trials, 19/478 (4.5%) people developed MRSA infection including SSI, chest infection and bacteraemia.
We included two trials (116 women) comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM. The number of included women in each trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes. Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation. There was no evidence of differences between groups for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight and admission to neonatal intensive care. Perinatal mortality was reported in one trial and there was insufficient evidence to determine whether it differed between the two groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 20.05).
This review found that staples are associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and cosmesis compared with sutures. However, it is important to note, that for both of these outcomes (wound infection and wound complication), staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of skin incision.
We identified 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 821 participants. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. Dosage and form of both green and black tea differed between trials. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules. No studies reported cardiovascular events. Black tea was found to produce statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and blood pressure over six months, but only a small number of trials contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias. Adverse events were measured in five trials and included a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalisation for influenza, appendicitis and retinal detachment. There are very few long-term studies to date examining green or black tea for the primary prevention of CVD.
This review found only two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of azathioprine in the treatment of chronic asthma. No data on oral steroid consumption were reported. No significant differences were observed in the studies for FEV1, FVC, PaO2 and symptoms. One study reported a statistically significant difference in SGaw, but the clinical importance of this is uncertain. Due to concerns over the small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings in terms of inadequate washout in one study, and methods used in outcome assessment for both studies, the findings of the studies are not generalisable to the issue of steroid tapering.
We identified 56 studies involving 4068 participants. The majority of studies were carried out in participants with breast cancer. A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, incorporating 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention. Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance. The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy.
We included five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials were co-ordinated in Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials were performed in Italy and the EORTC 20012 trial was conducted in Belgium. These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). All trials reported results for overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS). In contrast to the our first published review (2011), the addition of results from the EPACOPP escalated increases survival. This survival advantage is also reflected in an increased PFS, meaning that after five years only 144 (121 to 168) patients will experience a progress, relapse or death. Five trials reported adverse events and the analysis shows that the escalation of chemotherapy probably causes more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured. However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours which would not be expected to show significance until around 15 years after treatment.
We found 15 studies involving 1835 cancer patients. All studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials) or prostate cancer patients, (two trials). Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours. We did not find any studies on vocational interventions. Seven studies assessed the effects of a medical intervention on RTW. In all studies a less radical or functioning conserving medical intervention was compared with a more radical treatment. Five studies involved multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, biofeedback-assisted behavioral training and/or physical exercises were combined. We found low quality evidence that less radical conserving approaches had similar RTW rates as more radical treatments and moderate quality evidence of no differences in quality of life outcomes.
We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of concern. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel. Women allocated to admission CTG had, on average, higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour and fetal blood sampling than women allocated to intermittent auscultation. There were no differences between groups in other secondary outcome measures including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and incidence of seizures in the neonatal period. The data lacked power to detect important differences in perinatal mortality. However, any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences.
This review found that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific culture medium. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low for nearly all comparisons, the main limitations being imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.
This review found that there were no randomised controlled trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area and have considered that it is perhaps unethical to randomise women at such a vulnerable time such as waiting for a diagnosis.
This review found that psychological interventions, particularly those using a cognitive-behavioural framework, may reduce the frequency of chest pain in the first three months after the intervention. However, the evidence for other brief interventions was less clear. Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative. In addition, in three studies the blinding of participants was expressly forbidden by the local ethics committee because of issues in obtaining fully informed consent. For this reason, all studies had a high risk of bias.
We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised to receive topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers or placebo. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low.
This review found two studies that involved 1505 Indigenous youth. Both studies were carried out in the United States and were based in Native American populations (1505 participants in total). The two included studies employed multi-component community-based interventions tailored to the specific cultural aspects of the population and were conducted in the USA and Canada. The two studies were rated as high or unclear risk of bias in seven or more domains (out of a total of 10). Based on the available evidence, a conclusion cannot be drawn as to the effectiveness of tobacco prevention initiatives tailored for Indigenous youth in this area. Smoking prevalence in Indigenous youth is twice that of the non-Indigenous population, with tobacco experimentation starting at an early age. As such, a significant health disparity exists where Indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality.
We found one trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia. The trial was at unclear risk of bias. Overall, there were few events for most of the reported outcomes and the results were generally imprecise. The included trial reported no maternal mortality occurring in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion. Very low-quality evidence indicated no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, or markers of severe maternal morbidity (pulmonary embolism, congestive cardiac failure, acute chest syndrome, acute splenic sequestration), haemolytic crises, and delayed blood transfusions reaction between the comparison groups. Other relevant maternal outcomes pre-specified for this review such as cumulative duration of hospital stay, postpartum haemorrhage and iron overload, and infant outcomes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were not reported by the trial.
