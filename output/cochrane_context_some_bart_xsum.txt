A total of 38 studies involving 7843 children were included in this review. Asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency department visits and hospital admission. There were also fewer unscheduled doctor visits, but there was no statistically significant difference between education and control. Very few data were available for other outcomes (FEV1, PEF, rescue medication use, quality of life or symptoms).
We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. We found that ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions 2 to 5 µg/kg/minute; 10 studies used only S-ketamine and one only R-ketamines. The risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size; most studies had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity in the results. There was no significant difference in the risk of death or serious adverse events between ketamine and placebo in terms of the number of participants who died or had serious adverse effects. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who had a serious adverse event or serious side effects of ketamine compared to placebo. The quality of the evidence was low or very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and small numbers of participants.
Five trials with 217 participants were included; all five reported on safety, and two on efficacy. No severe or systemic adverse effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 µg of each antigen (39 to 45 µg total). One small efficacy trial with 17 non-immune participants with blood-stage malaria showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge. In the second efficacy trial in 120 children aged five to nine years in Papua New Guinea, episodes of clinical malaria were not reduced or delayed, but MSP/RESA vaccine did not reduce or delay the growth of the parasite. The third efficacy trial showed no effect of MSP or RESA vaccine on the number of children with clinical malaria. The fourth efficacy trial reported no adverse effects. The fifth trial reported that MSP and RESA vaccines were not effective in preventing clinical malaria in children aged between five and nine years. There were no serious adverse effects reported in any of the trials.
Four studies, involving 125 participants, were included in this review. Three studies evaluated the effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields and one study, capacitive coupled, electric fields. Although all studies were blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials, each study had limitations. The overall pooled size of the studies was small and not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 4.48; 4 trials). The proportion of participants whose fractures had united at a fixed time point was the primary measure of the clinical effect of electromagnetic field stimulation, but most data related to non-union fractures of the tibia. There was no significant difference between pulsed and capacitive-coupled electromagnetic fields in the number of participants with delayed union and non-unions of the long bones.
We included 12 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1831 participants in this review. Nine trials included patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy exclusively. Only two trials including 199 participants were of low risk of bias. The majority of participants in the trials were of moderate to high risk of adverse effects. The evidence is current to May 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of drain versus no drain for the removal of gallbladder in patients with acute chole cystitis. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not drain is better than no drain in the treatment of patients with gallstones. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. We rated the quality of evidence as low or very low due to the small number of trials included in the review, the small numbers of participants included in each trial, and the low number of participants.
Forty-nine randomised trials involving 3639 participants were included in this review. Thirty-eight different herbal medicines were tested in these trials, including four single herbs, eight traditional Chinese patent medicines, and 26 self concocted Chinese herbal compound prescriptions. The trials reported on global symptom improvement (including improvement in numbness or pain) and changes in nerve conduction velocity. The positive results described from the 49 studies of low quality are of questionable significance.
Five randomised controlled trials involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer, had relatively small populations, and were of short duration. Few events were reported and did not assess disease-specific survival or treatment group or metastatic disease. Only one study (N = 77) evaluated biochemical progression (defined by the authors as PSA) between IAS and CAS for Gleason score 4 - 6, 7, and 8 - 10. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression between the IAS group and the CAS group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who progressed to cancer recurrence. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether IAS is more effective than CAS in reducing the risk of progression to cancer.
We found 12 randomised controlled trials involving 7,119 participants. One of them randomised participants to either immediate or delayed insertion of IUDs. Five trials showed immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of having an IUD with a lower risk of pregnancy. One trial randomised to immediate versus delayed insertion showed a higher chance of having a pregnancy with a Copper 7 compared with a delayed IUD. The other five trials showed no difference between the two groups in the number of women who had a miscarriage. There were no differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of any of these methods for IUD insertion. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants in the included trials.
We found only one small randomised controlled trial that investigated the effects of meditation practice on patients newly hospitalised with acute leukaemia. Ninety-one participants enrolled in the study, but only 42 participants remained in the trial throughout the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found a high risk of attrition bias, which means that we cannot be certain that the results of the trial will be reliable. The study did not provide information about the number of participants who dropped out due to adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of included studies and the small numbers of participants.
We found three randomised controlled trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The included trials varied in study quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up and outcomes measured and, as such, were not suitable for meta-analysis. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella-zoster disease compared with 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine) recipients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of children who died or had serious adverse events. There were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of children with a serious adverse event. The evidence is current to August 2016.
We included 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 4704 participants, in this review. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different antibiotic regimens. Antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with no antibiotic in one trial in one study, and with no antibiotics in one other trial. With the exception of one trial, all the trials were at high risk of bias. The evidence is current to May 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in people with HIV/AIDS. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotics are effective in preventing STIs. The number of people who developed STIs was similar between the two groups, but there was no difference in the number of STIs between the groups. There were no clear differences in the risk of death or serious adverse events between the antibiotic groups. We did not find any clear differences between the antibiotics used to prevent STIs in terms of side effects. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low.
We included two randomised controlled trials (116 women) comparing planned home management versus hospital management for PPROM. One trial was too small to allow adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes, and the other trial was not large enough to allow us to assess the effect of home management on perinatal mortality. Both trials were conducted in the United States. Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomisation. Overall, the number of included women in each trial was small, and in both studies relatively few of the women were eligible for inclusion for inclusion. Perinatal deaths were reported in one trial in one study and in the other study in the second trial in the first trial. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of women included in the studies and the low number of outcomes reported in both trials. The evidence is current to January 2015.
In this review, we found that non-absorbable staples are associated with a similar incidence of wound infection and wound complication in women with Pfannenstiel incisions. However, it is important to note, that for both of these outcomes, staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of skin incision, i.e. vertical or horizontal. There is currently no conclusive evidence.
We identified 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 821 participants. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules. No studies examined a tea-based intervention. We did not find any studies examining the effect of tea on the number of people who died or experienced serious adverse events. We found no studies that compared tea with other types of tea. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as low or very low for the following reasons: (i.e. there were too few studies to be able to draw any firm conclusions; (ii) there were not enough participants to be sure of the results; and (iii) we did not have enough data to be confident in the results.
The evidence is current to August 2010. We found two small randomised controlled trials recruiting 23 participants. No data on oral steroid consumption were reported. No significant differences were observed in the studies for FEV1, FVC, PaO2 and symptoms. One study reported a statistically significant difference in SGaw, but the clinical importance of this is uncertain. Due to concerns over the small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings in terms of inadequate washout in one study, and methods used in outcome assessment for both studies, the findings of the studies are not generalisable to the issue of steroid tapering. Currently there is a clear lack of evidence to support the use of azathioprine for the treatment of asthma.
We found 56 studies (4068 participants) with a total of 28 studies (28 from the original search and 28 from the updated search), with the majority carried out in participants with breast cancer (28 studies). A meta-analysis of all fatigue data provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. Exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention at the end of the intervention period. We found no difference between the two groups of participants in terms of fatigue. There was no difference in the proportion of participants who reported feeling tired at the start of the exercise intervention period, but there were no differences between the groups in the number of people who reported being tired by the end. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low for fatigue. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We found five randomised controlled trials with a total of 3427 participants. These trials were co-ordinated in Germany and included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). We included all five trials in the meta-analyses in the review. One trial could be added on the previous review. We found that HD9 and HD14 were more effective than HD14 in reducing the number of people who needed to be treated with a blood transfusion. We did not find any evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of side effects. There was no evidence of differences between the groups in the amount of time taken to return to normal activities of daily living. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Fifteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including 1835 cancer patients met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials). Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psychosocial interventions compared with no intervention. We judged six studies to have a high risk of bias and nine studies to be of low quality. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We included four randomised controlled trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by a Scottish government (carried out in a specific political unit). No declarations of interest were made in two trials. We found no new trials in this update. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials included women who were in labour for between one and 12 weeks. Women in labour were followed up for at least 12 weeks after the start of the trial. There was no difference in the number of women who had a caesarean section and the length of hospital stay between the women and the babies. There were no differences between the groups in terms of length of stay, length of the hospital stay, number of babies born, or the time taken for the baby to be born. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups in the rate of the baby being born at the same time, or in the time that the baby is born. The quality of the evidence was low or very low because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of women included in the trials.
We included 32 studies in this review. Seventeen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230). It was not possible to pool any of the data because each study compared different culture media. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate. Four of these studies found no evidence of a difference between the media compared for either day three or day five embryo transfer. One of these found that for cleavage-stage embryo transfer, Quinn's Advantage was associated with a higher pregnancy rate than the other media. The data from the fifth study did not appear reliable. Six studies reported clinical pregnancy rate, which was similar between the two media. There was no difference in the number of women who had a live birth, ongoing pregnancy or failed to have a baby. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
This review aimed to assess the quality of the evidence for this question. A total of 30 citations appeared relevant however there were three duplicates which left 27 articles for further review. The authors have considered the possible reasons for the lack of research studies in this area. The review question remains unanswered as there were no randomised trials of methods of communicating a diagnosis of breast cancer to women. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality was therefore not possible.
We included 17 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1006 participants in this review. We included two new studies, one of which was an update of a previously included study, with the one new study contributing an additional 113 participants. There was a significant reduction in reports of chest pain in the first three months following the intervention, and a significant increase in the number of chest-free days (the number of days in which a person has no chest pain) in the nine months after the intervention. However, there was no difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who had chest pain at the end of the intervention period. There were no differences between the groups in any of the outcomes measured. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of participants in the included studies. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We identified 30 randomised controlled trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The follow-up of the trials showed that mast cell stabilisers and antihistamines were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, levocabastine, mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, and pemirolast potassium. There was no significant difference between these drugs in the number of people who died or experienced serious adverse events. There were no significant differences between any of the drugs in terms of side effects. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of any of these drugs for the treatment of asthma. The evidence is current to January 2016.
This review included two randomised controlled trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared skills-only versus skills-community groups. The studies were conducted in Native American populations and included 1505 participants. The two included studies employed multi-component community-based interventions tailored to the specific cultural aspects of the population and were based in the Native American population (a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Americas, or who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition). No difference was observed in weekly smoking at 42 months follow-up in the one study assessing this outcome (skills-community group versus control group; risk ratio [RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; risk of death] in total). The other study assessed weekly smoking in the skills community group (1505 participants). There was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who had quit smoking by the end of the study period. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the studies and the small size of the studies. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We found only one randomised controlled trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) that met our inclusion criteria. The trial reported no maternal mortality occurring in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion. There were few events for most of the reported outcomes and the results were generally imprecise to a reference standard. Very low-quality evidence indicated no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality (deaths occurring from the 28th week of GESTATION to 28th day after birth in a given population) or the number of women who died from any cause. There was no clear difference between the two groups of women in terms of the risk of dying or having a miscarriage. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of blood transfusions for the prevention of miscarriage in women with HbSS.
We found 67 randomised clinical trials involving a total of 6197 participants. A total of 5771 participants from 64 trials provided data for one or more outcomes included in this review. All the trials were at high risk of bias. There was no evidence of difference in most of the comparisons, and where there was, these differences were in single trials. There were no differences in the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event between the two groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants.
Twenty-three trials involving 724 people were included. There is evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids (improvement rate 44%, 95% CI 28 to 59%), oral PUVA (improved rate 26%, 95 CI 26 to 62%). However, a combination of PUVA and retinoid treatment is better than the individual treatment.
Nine trials evaluated the dose-related blood pressure-lowering efficacy of five drugs within the loop diuretics class (furosemide 40 mg to 60 mg, cicletanine 100 mg to 150 mg, piretanide 3 mg to 6 mg, indacrinone enantiomer -2.5 mg to -10.0/+80 mg, and etozolin 200 mg) in 460 people with baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg for a mean duration of 8.8 weeks. Withdrawals due to adverse effects and serum biochemical changes did not show a significant difference. The best estimate of systolic/diastolic blood-low blood pressure was -7.9 (-10.4 to -5.4) mm Hg/ -4.4 (-5.9 to -2 mm HG/ -2mm Hg for the duration of the trials. We performed additional searches for additional studies and found no new trials.
We included 58 trials, of which 48 trials with 2849 participants randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (1558 participants) versus control (1291 participants). Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All the trials except one trial with 30 participants were at high risk of bias. All trials used bupivacaine (a widely used anaesthetic agent) to induce local anaesthesia. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who died or had serious adverse events. We did not find any evidence of differences between the groups in the amount of pain experienced by people who received local anaesthetisation. There was not enough evidence to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of intraperitonal anaesthetics on the length of hospital stay. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of people included in the trials.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing different types of blood tests for the detection of malaria. We found 74 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries and included a wide range of antigens. The blood tests included HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) and pLDH (from p. malaria). We found that the blood tests were more accurate than the microscopy tests in detecting the presence of malaria in the blood of people with malaria. However, the results of the studies did not allow us to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of these tests. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. In comparison with microscopy, we identified 71 evaluations of Type 1 tests, eight evaluations of type 2 tests and five evaluations of types 3 and 4 tests. In addition, we found that there was no difference between the two tests in the number of people who had malaria and those who did not have malaria. There were no differences between the tests in terms of the proportion of people that had malaria or who had no malaria. The results of this review suggest that blood tests may be more effective than microscopy in detecting malaria, but we cannot be certain of this because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
Five studies met the inclusion criteria. All were conducted in the UK, and tested short-term changes in the consultation time allocated to each patient. None of the studies reported on the effects of altering the length of the consultation, number of referrals and investigations, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction based on very low-certainty evidence. Overall, our confidence in the results was very low; most studies had a high risk of bias, particularly due to non-random allocation of participants and the absence of data on participants' characteristics and small sample sizes.
We found three randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that met the inclusion criteria for this review. All three trials were conducted in developed countries. A total of 157 participants were recruited to the trials and all had sustained virologic suppression at baseline. The number of participants ranged from 24 to 92 and more than 79% of participants were male. The studies were at a high risk of selection bias, performance/detection and selective outcome reporting biases. Some baseline characteristics, participants were experienced ART experienced and all were men. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in terms of the number of women who died or had a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small sample sizes of the included studies. The evidence is current to January 2013.
Ten trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (n = 1658 participants). Six of the trials included recruitment manoeuvre as part of an open lung ventilation strategy that was different from control ventilation strategy (such as mode of breathing strategy, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration and low tidal volume or plateau pressure). Six studies reported mortality (all deaths). We found five trials to be at low risk of bias and five to be of moderate risk. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very high. We found no evidence that recruitment manoeuvres were more effective than control ventilation strategies in improving lung function. We did not find any evidence of a difference in lung function between recruitment and control ventilation. There was no evidence of any difference in quality of life between recruitment or control ventilation in any of the included trials. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results of this review.
Fifteen studies, involving 687 participants, were included in the review. Three studies measured our primary outcome but individually did not report significant differences between treatment and control. The use of 'as needed' medications was reduced in two studies, (47 patients), by relaxation therapy, and in four studies of 150 patients, (SMD -0.47, CI 1.22 to 16.44). There was no significant difference in FEV1 (the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity) for relaxation therapy (OR 4.01, CI 0.41 to 0.40). Quality of the included studies was poor. However, some pooled effects were analysed.
Thirty-five studies, including 6785 participants overall (of which 5365 in the arms of interest) were included in this review. We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressant and benzodiazepine in terms of dropouts due to any cause, even if confidence interval ranges of response rate (risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval (RR) 0.67 to 1.47; participants = 215; studies = 2). Very low quality evidence suggested a benefit for Benzodiazepines compared to antidepressant drugs, but only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes.
Twenty-nine trials, that enrolled over 1,700 participants with pancreatic carcinoma, were included in this review. Three eligible studies compared plastic stents to surgery. There was a trend towards lower risk of 30-day mortality with plastic stenting, but with higher risk of recurrent biliary obstruction prior to death (RR 18.59, 95% CI 5.33 - 64.86) when compared with surgery.
We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting 444 arterial cannulations in paediatric participants. Four RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound guidance with Doppler auditory assistance. Only two studies reported the rate of complications, such as haematoma formation. We found moderate-quality evidence that ultrasound guidance produces a higher success rate at first attempt and fewer complications, but the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and small numbers of participants. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included one small randomised controlled trial (80 male students in the Netherlands and published in 2009) and three ITS studies (general population studies in Canadian provinces conducted in the 1970s and 80s). The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with a low-alcohol content compared with those exposed to films with a neutral content drank less alcohol (mean difference -0.65 drinks compared with 0.73 drinks; 95% CI -1.2, -2.07; p value = 0.03, very-low-quality evidence). The ITS study found no difference in the amount of alcohol consumed by young men who were exposed to commercials for alcohol compared to those who were not. However, the ITS study did not find any difference between the groups in terms of the proportion of men who drank less or more than those who did not drink. There was no clear difference between groups in the number of people who stopped drinking because of side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and dizziness. There were no clear differences in the percentage of people in either group who had a headache. The studies did not show any difference in alcohol consumption between groups. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
Eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 182 infants were included in this review. There was no evidence of difference in short-term growth parameters when high and low MCT formula was compared. Head circumference gain, based on data from five studies, showed a non-significant WMD of 0.14 cm/wk (95% CI -0.04, 0.31). Similarly, meta-analysis of weight gain in g/d based on two studies showed no evidence for difference (WMD 2.35 g/kg/d) between the two groups. There were no differences in length gain or head circumference gain between the groups. However, there was a small increase in the proportion of infants who were overweight or obese compared to those who were of normal weight.
We included one small trial (with data from 34 participants) comparing transcervical amnioinfusion with no amniotic fluid. The trial was considered to be at a high risk of bias overall, due to small numbers, inconsistency in the reporting and lack of information on blinding (receiving). Meta-analysis of the results was not possible due to the small numbers of participants in the trial and the lack of data on blinding. The trials did not provide enough information to be able to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of transcervics. Transcervics may be effective in reducing the risk of preterm birth, but we do not know if they are effective in preventing preterm delivery. We did not find any evidence to support or refute the use of transcervicals in preterm labour. We rated the quality of the evidence as low or very low.
Three studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1620 participants. There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies which precluded a pooled meta-analysis of the results. The sensitivity of the Mini-Cog in the individual studies was reported as 0.99, 0.76 and 0.83. The accuracy of the diagnostic test varied in the studies and was 0.93. There are currently few studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of a cognitive screening test in community settings. Additional well-designed studies are required in order to determine the accuracy and utility of the community based tests in community based settings. The limited number of studies and the methodological limitations that are present in the current studies make it difficult to provide recommendations for or against the use of community-based cognitive screening tests.
We included 19 studies that investigated three types of amphetamine: dexamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and mixed amphetamine salts. These studies enrolled 2521 participants; most were middle-aged (35.3 years), Caucasian males (57.2%), with a combined type of ADHD (78.8%). Eighteen studies were conducted in the USA, and one study was conducted in both Canada and the USA. All studies were placebo-controlled, and three also included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine. Most studies had short-term follow-up and a mean study length of 5.3 weeks. We found no studies that had low risk of bias in all domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' review. The evidence is current to May 2016. We did not find any studies that compared dexamphetamine to placebo, or any other amphetamine to placebo. The results of this review suggest that dexamphetamine may be effective in the treatment of ADHD. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of dexamphetamine as a treatment for ADHD. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
We included six new studies (517 participants) in this review update, bringing the total of included studies to 10 (811 participants). The studies were heterogeneous with regard to study quality, the chronic pain conditions that were investigated, the dose of vitamin D given, co-interventions, and the outcome measures reported. Overall, there was no consistent pattern that vitamin D treatment was associated with greater efficacy than placebo in any chronic pain condition. Only two studies reported responder pain outcomes; the other studies reported treatment group average outcomes only. Adverse events and withdrawals were not reported in any of the studies. The quality of the evidence was low.
This review identified 42 studies involving more than 200 practices and 48,000 patients. Twenty-seven studies were RCTs, 12 were CBAs, and two were ITS. In all studies the intervention strategy was multifaceted. In 15 studies patient education was added to the professional and organisational intervention, in nine they were targeted at the organisation of care, and 20 studies targeted both. Arrangements for follow-up (organisational intervention) also showed a favourable effect on process outcomes, but the effect on patient outcomes remained less clear as these were rarely assessed. A combination of professional intervention and patient education improved process outcomes. The quality of the studies was often poor (below the standard of the community).
Five trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included a total of 1503 women, with a mean of 301 participants. The trials compared the following contraceptives: combined oral contraceptive versus transdermal contraceptive patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system 20 µg/day (LNG-IUS 20); LNG- IUS 12; LNG, IUS 20, or LNG/IUS 50 µg; and LNG versus LNG. The women in the trials were followed up for at least six months after the start of the trial. The evidence is current to January 2016. The included trials compared LNG and IUS with other types of birth control pills. LNG was found to be more effective than LNG in reducing the number of women who had a miscarriage, but there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the proportion of women having a miscarriage. There was no clear difference between LNG or IUS between the groups in the amount of time the women had to wait for their period to return to normal menstrual cycles. The results of this review do not support the use of any of the following contraceptive methods. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether any of these methods are effective in preventing pregnancy. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing immunotherapy with placebo or no treatment. We found eight trials that met our inclusion criteria. There were 42 trials of immunotherapy for house mite allergy; 27 pollen allergy trials; two Cladosporium mould allergy trials, two latex allergy trials and six trials looking at multiple allergen allergy trials. Concealment of allocation of allocation was assessed as clearly adequate in only 16 of these trials; 10 animal dander allergy trials looked at multiple dander allergies; two latex and six trial looked at different types of latex allergy. There was no difference in the number of people who developed allergic reactions in any of the trials. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of people included in the studies. The overall quality of evidence was low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were that there were too few trials to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.
We found six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1297 patients. Mortality at day 28 was significantly reduced by lung-protective ventilation with a relative risk of a low risk of death (RR) (RR = 0.05) compared to a control group. There was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients who died. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The overall quality of evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of patients included in the included trials. There is a need for larger, well-designed, and well-conducted randomised clinical trials to assess the benefits and harms of lung-protecting ventilation in patients with COPD.
We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1833 participants. We found that time to emergence from anaesthesia, that is, time needed to follow verbal commands, was longer with isoflurane than with propofol (mean difference -3.29 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.41 to -1.18, low-quality evidence), and time to emerge from anaesthetic was not different with sevof lurane compared with prop ofol. There was no clear difference in the number of people who needed to be put back into the operating room. There were no clear differences between the two drugs in terms of time taken to return to consciousness. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.
Four randomised controlled trials including 15,936 hypertensive subjects were identified. The average age of the participants was 75.4 years. The combined results from the three trials reporting change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) did not indicate a benefit from treatment and placebo (236/7767 versus 259/7660, Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% CI 0.74, 1.07) and there was considerable heterogeneity between the trials. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower in the treatment groups than in the control groups. There was no significant difference between treatment and control groups in the incidence of dementia in people younger than age sixty five years of age. There were no significant differences in the risk of death from any cause between the two treatment groups.
We included 12 randomised controlled trials enrolling 3474 patients in this review. The overall risk of bias was unclear for the majority of articles due to a lack of reported data. There was no evidence of the effectiveness in improving patient outcomes of PTCRA in non-complex lesions. In complex lesions, there were no statistically significant differences in re-stenosis rates at six months (RR 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.33) and at one year (RR 2.55) in those receiving adjunctive balloon angioplasty compared to those receiving standard balloon surgery. There was no clear difference in the number of patients who had to be re-stenosis-free (i.e. no death) or re-seizure rates in those who had a balloon operation. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of pTCRA for the treatment of angina in patients with complex angina.
Three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 333 participants were identified, two of which were multicentre trials comprising only participants positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The other trial enrolled participants diagnosed with bronchiolitis from a hospital in Italy. Adjunctive therapy included nebulised salbutamol, steroids, supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids or tube feeding, nasal washing, nasal decongestants and antibiotics. All studies used 2.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of rhDNase compared with placebo either as a daily or a twice daily dose. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event. There were no differences between the groups in terms of the proportion of participants who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and those who were discharged from the ICU. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of participants included in the studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies.
We found two studies with a total of 181 participants. One study had a small sample size and did not adequately report method of randomisation, allocation concealment or pre-selected outcomes. The second study was a larger study with few sources of bias and good methodology. We found no significant difference in mortality between groups, with only one death occurring overall, in the totally percutaneous group (risk ratio 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 36.18; 181 participants) and moderate-quality evidence that cut-down femoral artery access does not reduce the risk of death. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay. There were no significant differences in the rate of serious adverse events between the groups. We judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results.
In this review, we found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of a sponge versus a diaphragm for the prevention of pregnancy. We found that the sponge was significantly less effective in preventing overall pregnancy than was the diaphradm in both trials. In the larger USA trial, the 12-month cumulative life-table termination rates per 100 women for overall pregnancy were 17.4 for the sponge and 12.8 for the diphragm in the UK trial. The rates were 24.5 for the sponges in the USA trial and 10.9 for the dilation and curettage (dilation of the womb) trial. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of women who had to have a caesarean section. There were no differences between the groups in the rate of women having to have an operation to remove the baby from the mother's womb. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not the sponge is more effective at preventing pregnancy.
Six studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review, six of which were included. Three studies investigated prevent and three studies investigated amelioration. Two studies investigated a pharmacological intervention for the prevent of cognitive deficits compared with placebo; memantine (AMANTADINE derivative that has some dopaminergic effects); and d-threo-methylphenidate (DMT) (a central nervous system stimulant) HCL. One study compared methylphenidate HCL with placebo, and one study compared memantine with placebo. In the first study to evaluate interventions to prevent cognitive deficits, memantine HCL was more effective than placebo in preventing cognitive deficits. The second study found that d-THRAPE was less effective than memantine, and the third study found no difference between memantine and placebo. There was no difference in the number of people who developed cognitive deficits between the two groups. There were no differences between the groups in terms of side effects. The evidence is current to January 2015.
This review included two randomised controlled trials. Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment compared to placebo. The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years. The two studies assessed as at high risk of bias, reporting data, and reporting data from 26 analysed participants were included in this review. In one study, patients reported altered sensation following treatment with laser therapy on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury. In the other study, there was no difference between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who experienced side effects. There was no significant difference in side effects between the treatment groups. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We found two trials (281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses) that met our inclusion criteria. One trial (involving 161 pregnancies) was based on women with a history of diabetes. It showed no statistically significant difference between using combined oestrogen and progestogen and using placebo for all our proposed primary outcomes, namely, miscarriage rate, pregnancy rate, and the number of women who had a miscarriage. The other trial involved women with diabetes who were given a placebo (a dummy drug) and a combination of progestogens and oestrogens. The two trials had significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity such that a meta-analysis combining trial data was considered inappropriate (correct or proper).
This review included 14 studies with extractable data. Ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6-8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo, this was 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.43. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patients, and the numbers needed for SSRI's ranged from 63% to 26% respectively. There was no difference in the number of adverse events between TCAs and SSRI groups. The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the short duration of the studies.
We found nine studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) that compared ibuprofen 200 mg versus placebo or other active comparators (dummy or treatment or no treatment). None of the included studies combined any of these drugs with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated the participants with single doses of medication. The results of the studies were similar for 2-hour pain-free (26% versus 12% with placebo) and 24-hour sustained headache relief (57% versus 25%) and the number of participants with headache relief were 7.2, 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. The number of people who had a headache for more than 24 hours was 7.0. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people with a headache over 24 hours in the number who had no headache at the end of the study. There were no serious side effects reported in the studies. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included 43 randomised controlled trials (43 trials involving 3497 participants with dry eye) in this review. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of any of the interventions in reducing dry eye symptoms in dry eye. We did not find any evidence of a difference in the number of participants who developed dry eye, the severity of the symptoms, or the length of time it took for the symptoms to return to normal. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. We were unable to combine the results of the included trials because of the differences in the types of diagnostic criteria, interventions, comparison, and measurements taken, our ability to perform meta-analyses (a method of combining results of independent studies) and synthesizing summaries and conclusions which may be used to draw conclusions, was limited by the small number of studies included in the review, and the heterogeneity of the studies. There was not enough information to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of any particular intervention in terms of dry eye symptom control. We judged the quality of evidence from the included studies to be low or very low.
This review found only one small randomised trial in 136 patients. There was no difference in virological outcomes in the group who maintained lamivudine in their second-line regimen compared to those who did not in their subsequent regimen. Two other small observational studies reported in abstract form did not report a difference in the proportion of those with viral suppression after six months and time to HIV-1 RNA. There were no trials identified comparing boosted boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) or nucleoside backbone combinations (FTCs) to those on a 3TC or emtricitabine regimen.
We included 133 randomised controlled trials involving 844,206 participants in this review. We found seven different prespecified index tests in the 133 studies, as well as 69 non-prespecified, and 32 combinations. We mostly observed low risk of bias for patient selection for the different domains, and failed intubation in two studies. Difficult face mask ventilation was the reference standard in seven studies, difficult laryngoscopy in 92 studies, and difficult tracheal intubations in 50 studies. We did not find any difference in the number of people who died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for any of these outcomes. We also found no differences in the proportion of patients who were discharged from the ICU for any reason. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and small numbers of participants.
Sixty-three studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 8014 participants. Of these, 56 trials recruited infants and young children. The trials varied in the definition of diarrhoea and also varied greatly in the organisms tested, dosage tested, and participants' characteristics. Probiotics reduced the duration and the end of the diarrhoeal illness, although the size of the effect varied considerably between studies. No adverse events were attributed to the probiotic intervention, as well as in the risk of bias. The average of the effects of probiotics was significant for mean duration (mean difference 24.76 hours; 95% confidence interval (CI) 24.74 hours to 24.99 hours) and the duration of the end-of-the-disease illness (average difference 24 hours; CI 24.75 hours to 25.00 hours). Probiotics did not reduce the number of people who developed a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We included only one study that compared nidotherapy-enhanced standard care with standard care alone (total 52 participants). The duration of the included study was 18 months in total. The single study was classified by its authors as a 'pilot study' and examined the short-term (up to six months) and long-term effects of the treatment. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of people who died or experienced serious adverse events. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who had a serious adverse event between the treatment groups. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants in the study and the small size of the study.
We found eight studies with a total of 3283 participants. Five studies had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment, and one study had an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses (a graphic means for assessing the ability of a study participants to be included in the analysis) carried forward. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of participants who dropped out of the studies due to side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be moderate to low.
We included one randomised controlled trial (involving 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia at term) that compared magnesium sulphate with a placebo. The trial did not report any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes. There was no significant difference in Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (risk ratio (RR) and was at a low risk of bias) and there was no difference between the two groups in the number of babies born alive at term. There were no serious adverse events reported in either group. There is currently no evidence to support the use of magnesium sulphates for the treatment of preterm birth.
Four studies met all of the eligibility criteria for inclusion within the review. Two studies used combination therapies consisting of a pharmacotherapy combined with cognitive and behavioural therapies, whilst the remaining two studies used counselling through counselling, one via text message support and the other delivered via clinic trained doctors trained in smoking cessation techniques. A significant effect of the combination therapies was observed in favour of the intervention (risk ratio 1.43, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.98, p=0.032), however following sensitivity analysis a statistically non-significant but clinically significant effect was observed. There was no significant difference between the intervention and the control group in the number of people who quit smoking. There were no significant differences between the interventions in terms of number of smokers who quit, number of patients who stopped smoking and number of days off work or school. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included 13 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with a total of 5686 patients in this review. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day or 60-day mortality). We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care (four studies) to be at high risk of bias. We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection for selection, attrition and reporting bias, and we rated the remaining studies as moderate risk. We judged blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment to be high risk in about half of the included studies and at low risk in 25% to 30%. We rated the quality of the evidence to be moderate to very low. We found that there was no difference in the number of patients who died or were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the two groups of studies. There was no significant difference between the groups of patients in terms of the length of stay in the ICU. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) who were discharged early from the hospital. The quality of evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of patients included in the studies. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Six studies (n = 478) of variable quality were included. A composite outcome of Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), Neonatal Facial Action Coding System (NFCS) and/or Premature Pain Profile (PIPP) score was reported in 288 infants, who did not receive a sweet tasting solution. There was a significant reduction in the number of infants requiring more than one skin puncture versus heel lance (reported in 4 studies; n = 254). Cry characteristics favoured the venepuncture group but the differences were reduced by the provision of a sweet-tasting solution. The typical RD for requiring more skin punctures was 3 (95% CI 2 to 4) and the NNT to avoid one repeat puncture was 3. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of infants who needed to be re-intervened. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of sweet tasting solutions for the treatment of heel lances.
Two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry have been included in this review. Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured. There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women). Similarly, only one trial measured how healing at six months was measured, although there was no reference to this outcome. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of the number of women who were discharged from the hospital and the length of time it took for the wound to heal. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of women included in the studies.
We found 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Chinese medicinal herbs with different antiviral drugs, precluding any pooling of results. There were no significant differences between 'E Shu You' and ribavirin in treating influenza, nor in the occurrence of influenza symptoms. 'Ganmao' capsules were found to be more effective than amantadine in decreasing influenza symptoms and speeding recovery in one study, although no data were reported in the other studies. There was no significant difference in the number of people who experienced side effects. The quality of the included studies was poor.
We included 8 studies with a total of 580 participants. Interventions included: thrombolytic therapy versus placebo (1 study); alteplase versus urokinase (1); short versus long thrombophlebitis (1), fibrin sheath stripping versus over-the-wire catheter exchange (1) and low versus high dose (1). No two studies compared the same interventions (investigations by nurses designed to test a hypothesized cause effect relation by modifying the supposed causal factor in the study population). We found no differences in the number of participants who died or experienced serious adverse events between the intervention groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons published) published time-to-event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity. We found no significant differences in the number of women who died from any cause between the two treatment regimens. There was also no significant difference in the rate of side effects between the treatment groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low, mainly because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of patients included in the trials.
Ten random or quasi-random controlled trials reported on a total of 1896 patients. There was no statistically significant effect on inpatient mortality or mortality to longest follow up. Discharge to institutional care was reduced for the NLU (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89) and functional status at discharge was increased for the SMD (SMD 0.56, 0.86 to 2.68). The quality of the studies ranged from low to very low. There were no differences between the two groups in the number of patients who died or were discharged from hospital. However, there was a higher risk of death from any cause in the SLU group compared to the SLD group. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of SLU in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia.
We included 11 studies including 414 participants in the review. Two trials compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo, two compared one ultrasound regimen with another non-surgical intervention (for example, exercises and splint), and six compared ultrasound as part of a multi-component intervention. The risk of bias was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only two reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed and six reporting that participants were blinded. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. There was no difference between the groups in the number of people who had to have their leg amputated. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included eight studies involving approximately 10,000 people with a previous history of stroke or TIA. The active interventions were pravastatin, atorvastatin (a synthetic lipid-lowering agent), simvastatan, clofibrate, and conjugated oestrogen. There was no overall effect on stroke recurrence but statin therapy alone had a marginal benefit in reducing subsequent cerebrovascular events in stroke survivors. There were no clear differences between the intervention and statin groups in all-cause mortality, stroke-related quality of life, or death from any cause. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Studies differed in design, settings, duration, content and intensity of intervention, length of follow-up, methods of evaluation and also in definitions and measures of smoking behaviour used. Among seven campaigns reporting smoking prevalence, significant decreases were observed in the California and Massachusetts statewide statewide tobacco control campaigns compared with the rest of the USA. However, there was no clear difference in the number of people who stopped smoking compared with those who continued to smoke. There were no clear differences in the proportion of smokers who quit smoking compared to those who did not quit. There was not enough evidence to be able to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of these campaigns.
We included 24 studies with a total of 2166 participants, 23 of which provided data for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies had low risk of selection bias, five studies reported adequate blinding of outcome assessment and 15 studies had high risk of attrition bias. Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life in the short term (pooled SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, 675 participants), reduce fatigue, reduce sleep disturbances and reduce sleep apnea in the long term. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. There was no clear difference between yoga and no therapy in terms of the number of people who experienced fatigue, sleep disturbances or sleep apnoea. There were no clear differences between the two groups in the proportion of participants who experienced sleepiness or sleepiness related to yoga. Yoga did not appear to be associated with an increase in the risk of depression or anxiety. Yoga was associated with a reduction in sleepiness, fatigue and sleep disturbances, but there was no difference between the groups in any of these outcomes. Yoga may not be effective in reducing fatigue or sleep disturbances in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Yoga may be beneficial in reducing sleep disturbances. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of yoga for people with COPD.
We found one study that compared post-operative imaging within 48 hours of surgery for glioblastoma with no early post-operative imaging. The study included 125 people who had surgery for grade 4 glioma. Most of the people in the study underwent maximal surgical resection followed by combined radiotherapy and temozolomide. Post-operational imaging showed no difference in the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups in terms of number of patients who had to have their tumour removed. There were no differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events between the early and the no-treatment groups. However, there was a small increase in the risk of death in the early postoperative imaging group compared with the no treatment group. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants and the small size of the study. We judged the quality of evidence from this study to be low to very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results of this review.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 161 people with schizophrenia. Data were available for only two of our seven main outcomes. There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups (2 RCTs, n = 120, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47, very low quality evidence) and numbers of participants with parkinsonism at eight weeks were similar. There were no useable data available for the other key outcomes (clinically important improvement in global state, global state using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and number of people with Parkinson's disease) and there were no clear differences in the number of participants who were discharged from hospital. The quality of the evidence was very low.
Twenty-three studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Probiotics were not superior to placebo for any outcome measured. The use of nitroimidazole antibiotics appeared to reduce the risk of clinical recurrence (RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.09 to 0.74, NNT = 4). Mesalamine therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence compared to placebo. However, these agents were associated with higher risk of serious adverse events (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.7) and endoscopic complications (RR 3.44, 95%) than placebo.
We included seven randomised controlled trials (825 participants). The psychosocial interventions considered in the studies were: cognitive-behavioural coping skills training (one study), brief interventions (three studies), motivational interviewing (two studies), and brief motivational interviewing in one study). Two studies were considered in two comparisons, twelve-step programme (one trial) and brief intervention (two trials). There were no data for the secondary outcome, alcohol-related harm. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found seven studies that met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies had a high or unclear risk of bias, which means that we are unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the interventions. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low. The studies did not provide enough information to be able to draw firm conclusions about whether or not the interventions were effective in reducing the number of people who dropped out of the study.
We found 23 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1586 participants. Fifty-eight per cent of these participants were from five unpublished studies. Quinine was compared to placebo (a dummy medication or treatment) (20 trials, n = 510), a quinine-theophylline combination (three trials, 543), vitamin E (four trials, 1140), and vitamin E-vitamin E combination (one trial) (n = 543). Quinine did not appear to be more effective than placebo in reducing the number of participants with bronchiolitis. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. There was no clear difference in the proportion of participants who were treated with quinines compared to placebo. There were no clear differences in the percentage of participants treated with vitamin E compared to vitamin E or vitamin E plus placebo. The overall quality of evidence was low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of included trials and the small numbers of participants.
We identified seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramp (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers. Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that magnesium may reduce the frequency and severity of leg cramps in people with nocturnal leg cramping. However, there was no clear difference between magnesium and placebo in the frequency of cramps or the severity of the cramps. There was not enough evidence to determine whether magnesium reduces the frequency or severity of menstrual cramps, or whether it reduces the number of women who need to be seen by a doctor. The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
We found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared a six-month, home-based, combined muscle strength and recumbent cycle ergometry training program versus usual care in 14 ambulatory people with SMA. The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but 50% of them did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who were able to perform aerobic exercise at the end of the study. There were no differences between the groups in any of the outcomes measured. The study did not report on quality of life, disability, disability-related mortality, or quality of physical activity. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Two randomised controlled trials (N = 149) were included in this review. One trial (81 patients with cervical radiculopathy) found that surgical decompression was superior to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in the short-term for pain, weakness or sensory loss; at one year, there were no significant differences between groups. The other trial (68 patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy) did not find a difference between surgery and conservative treatment. The quality of the evidence was unclear. In both trials, allocation concealment was inadequate and arrangements for blinding of outcome assessment were unclear. The evidence is current to May 2016.
Nine studies met our inclusion criteria. Six studies compared telephone consultation versus normal care; four by a doctor, one by a nurse and one by clinic clerk. Two studies compared health assistants with doctor or nurse, six showed no difference between the groups and one, of nurse telephone consultation, found an increase in visits to GP's but two found a significant increase in return consultations. Seven studies looked at accident and emergency department visits (Hospital department visits). Three of five studies found a decrease in visits compared with GP's and one found no difference in visits between health assistants and doctor. One study looked at telephone consultation by different types of health care workers (health assistants, nurse and clinic clerk). Two studies reported a reduction in visits by health assistants compared with doctor and one study reported an increase by a health assistant compared with health assistants. The studies did not report on the effect of telephone consultation on the number of calls made to the emergency department. The quality of the studies ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included 84 randomised controlled trials (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting intervention in higher risk individuals or settings. Studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short-term reporting or publication bias. Overall, the risk of bias assessment showed that these studies provided moderate or low quality evidence. At four or more months following-up, we found effects in favour of MI for the quantity of alcohol consumed (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.03 to 0.16) for the number of people who reported drinking alcohol. We did not find any evidence of a difference between groups in terms of the proportion of participants who reported that they had been drinking alcohol for at least three months. We found no evidence of differences between groups for the frequency of alcohol-related adverse events. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
This review includes 29 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 2210 participants. All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most of the studies were at low or unclear risk of bias and at high risk of selection and attrition biases. We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect (caused by the estimates being imprecise). The evidence is up to date as of May 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma in adults with asthma. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in the risk of death or serious adverse events between the cortics and the control groups. The quality of evidence was low or very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
Three small trials, involving 226 participants, were included in this review. One trial included patients with presumed ischaemic stroke without computerised tomography (CT) verification, and the other two trials included participants with CT-verified ICH. Data on the primary outcome measure (death and disability) were not available in any of the trials. Death and disability could be calculated in the larger ICH-verified trial, and death and disability were not reported in the trial involving patients with CT with CT verification. There was no difference in the number of patients who had a stroke and those who did not have a stroke. There were no differences between the two groups of patients in terms of death or disability. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CT for the diagnosis and treatment of ICH in patients with ICH who have had a suspected stroke.
Six randomised controlled trials were identified, with 425 patients randomized to D-penicillamine (3-Mercapto-D-valine) and 258 to placebo. A statistically significant benefit was observed when compared to placebo for all three-dose ranges and for most outcome measures including: tender joint counts, pain, physician's global assessments and ESR. The difference for ESR in moderate dose was -10.56 (95% CI -0.25, -1.26) for pain and the difference for doctor's global assessment was -2.97 (95%) for pain. There was no significant difference in ESR between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the number of side effects between the groups. The quality of the evidence was low.
We included four relevant trials. All of them were of low quality. The trials used a decoction containing Huangqi compounds as the intervention with chemotherapy. There was a significant reduction in the proportion of patients who experienced nausea & vomiting compared to a chemotherapy alone control group. There were no significant differences in the number of patients with nausea and vomiting when Huangqi was compared with two other Chinese herbal interventions. None of the studies reported on primary outcome using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients in terms of side effects. The quality of the evidence was very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included a total of 866 participants aged four to 55 years. One trial evaluated the effect of vitamin A A A alone, one trial evaluated DHA alone, and a third trial evaluated vitamin A and DHA with RP of all forms of genetic predisposition. All three trials were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The evidence is current to January 2016. The evidence from the three trials was of moderate quality. The results of the three RCTs did not show a difference in the risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity (RP) with vitamin A or DHA. There was no clear difference between the two groups in the number of people who developed retinitis pigmentosa (retinopathy) and the number who did not develop RP. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of DHA or vitamin A for the prevention of RP in people with RP. We judged the quality of evidence to be low or very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included in the studies.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 414 participants at risk of job loss. The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS. The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits and any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions was not reported in any of the studies. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of vocational counselling in preventing job loss or improving work functioning. The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies.
We identified three eligible studies that included a total of 285 preterm babies (140 received arginine and 140 received a placebo) from three countries. The evidence is current to May 2015. We found that arginines reduced the risk of developing NEC in preterm infants compared with the placebo group. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) as required to prevent the development of NEC was reduced by about one-third among preterm neonates in the arpinine group compared to the placebo. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results of this review.
This review included four studies involving 1943 participants with acute sinusitis. The trials were well-designed and double-blind and studied INCS versus placebo or no intervention for 15 or 21 days. The rates of loss to follow-up were 7%, 11%, 41% and 10%. When we combined the results from the three trials included in the meta-analysis, participants receiving INCS were more likely to experience resolution or improvement in symptoms than those receiving placebo (73% versus 66.4%; risk ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.18). Higher doses of INCS had a stronger effect on improvement of symptoms or complete relief: for mometasone furoate 400 µg versus 200 µg (RR 1.02, 95% CI 1.06, 1.03) and mometa-furoate 600 µg compared to 200 µG (RR 2.18 versus RR 2.11). The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The quality of evidence was low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants.
This review found that the administration of vancomycin in low doses reduced the incidence of both total nosocomial sepsis and coagulase negative staphylococcal septicaemia in eligible preterm infants. However, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the use of low doses reduces the risk of development of resistant organisms in the nurseries involved in these trials, as the blood cultures drawn from central lines may have failed to grow due to lack of nutrients. There were no differences in mortality, length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), length of hospital stay, and the number of deaths between the groups.
Fourteen reports of 13 RCTs on dressings or topical agents for postoperative wounds healing by secondary intention were identified. A single small trial of aloe vera supplementation compared with gauze suggests delayed healing with aloevera supplementation. There were no statistically significant differences in healing for other dressing comparisons. A plaster cast applied to an amputation stump accelerated wound healing compared with elastic compression, WMD -25.60 days, 95% CI -49.08 to -2.12 days (1 trial), the results of this trial are un interpretable since there was a large differential loss to follow up.
We found 11 randomised controlled trials that included 1482 women. Five trials were published before 1985 and six from 2005 to 2014. Four trials examined combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and three studied a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). We found two trials of progestin-only pills and two of the etonogestrel implant. Most trials did not report significant differences between the study arms on the results of a research study to evaluate interventions or exposures on biomedical or health-related outcomes in breastfeeding. We did not find any evidence of a difference between the groups in terms of the number of women who developed breast cancer. We found no evidence of an effect on the risk of breast cancer in any of the included trials. The evidence is current to January 2015.
In this review, we included 10 studies from Australia, Singapore and the USA. We grouped them according to the extent to which they adjusted for regression to the mean (RTM) and spillover effects. Two studies that partially addressed RTM and three that partially adjusted for RTM but failed to consider spillover had a rate ratio of 0.71 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.98); one that made no adjustments was 0.80 (95%) and one that partially looked at RTM had 0.87 (95%). The only study that did not adjust for both reported a rate of 1.54 (95%), which was higher than the rate reported in the other studies. We found that there was no difference between the two studies in the number of people who died or were seriously injured. There were no differences between the studies in terms of the proportion of people killed or seriously injured in either the right-angle or the left-angle crashes. There was also no difference in the percentage of people injured in the two groups of studies. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference between RTM or spillover in the rate of deaths and serious injuries. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in them.
Four randomised controlled trials involving 494 participants were included in this review. Three studies involving 383 participants provided data on the proportion of participants who achieved a therapeutic INR by day five. One study showed significant benefit of a 10-mg warfarin nomogram nomogram for the proportion who had achieved an INR on day five, although with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 90%). The review authors analyzed each study separately because it was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis by inpatient or outpatient status. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found that a 10 mg warfarinsomnogram nomograms were associated with a significant reduction in the number of people who had a blood clot in the leg and a reduction in blood clots in the arm. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the overall effect of the nomograms, although the evidence is limited by the small number of participants included in the studies and the small numbers of studies. The authors concluded that the evidence for the effect of a nomogram on the number and percentage of people achieving a therapeutic insemination of blood clot was of moderate quality.
We included seven trials with a total of 555 participants. Three trials compared models of enhanced care in the inpatient setting with conventional care. Two trials compared geriatrician-led care in-hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. One trial compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with standard care. None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia, therefore the data were not available for this review. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to May 2016. The review authors found no evidence to support or refute the use of these interventions in the treatment of dementia in the short-term or long-term. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not these interventions are effective in improving the quality of care provided in the long term.
We found seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 840 participants. Participants, interventions, interventions and outcomes were diverse. No significant differences were reported in health outcomes; two studies reported a reduction in the length of hospital stay with no difference in the hospital readmission rate. Home care was reported as more costly for service providers with substantial cost of care and improvement in child behaviours. Overall increased parental satisfaction was reported in three studies. Also, better parental coping and family functioning was reported by one study. However, one study each reported no impact on parental burden of care or on functional status of children. There was no significant difference between home care and hospital care in the number of children who were admitted to the hospital. The quality of the evidence was low.
We included 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 7524 participants. We found data relevant to two comparisons when ICM was compared with standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that ICM did not appear to be more effective than standard care in reducing the risk of relapse or improving mental state in people with schizophrenia. However, there was no clear evidence of a difference between ICM and standard care for improving quality of life. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low.
Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. All but one trial were at high risk of bias. Overall, 16 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants). All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. There was no significant difference between box training and video trainers in the number of participants who dropped out of the trials. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who had to be re-admitted to hospital after box training compared to video training. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
Two randomised clinical trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline in 17 patients with cholangitis (pancreatitis, paranoid ideas, fluid retention) with septicaemia, and paranoid ideas. The other trial compared saline versus saline. The results of this trial were inconclusive. There was no difference in the number of adverse events between the two treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the amount of biliary fluid retained in the bile ducts of the biliary ducts, and there was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the proportion of patients who had an improvement in biliary drainage. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of bile lavage for the treatment of chronic biliary ulcerative colitis.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that compared early nutritional support with delayed nutritional support. We found 11 trials with a total of 284 participants. Seven trials addressed the timing of support (early versus delayed), data on mortality were obtained for all seven trials. Data on disability were available for three trials (284 participants). The relative risk of death or disability at the end of follow-up was 0.67 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.07). The RR for death with early nutrition support was 0% (95%) and the RR for disability was 0%. We found no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of participants who died or experienced disability. We did not find any differences in the number or severity of adverse events between the groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis. Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions drank approximately 23 g alcohol a week (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal intervention at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence). Participants who received digital interventions had less than one drinking week less than those who did not engage in digital interventions. We found no evidence of a difference in the risk of death or serious adverse events between participants who were given digital interventions and those who were not. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias).
We included 24 studies with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomly allocated to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor (below the standard of the community). We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment to treat (RR RR) for the two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazine over placebo over placebo. However, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies to be at high risk of being biased.
We found 13 small studies (1520 participants randomised) and three ongoing trials. Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver and kidney disease. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high-risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies). Duration and style of tai chi differed between trials, so we were not able to combine the results of these studies. We found no evidence to support or refute the benefits or harms of the practice. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to September 2016.
Twenty-seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India. Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco, the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care (considered customary care) provided to all participants; or school-based intervention (preventive health services provided to students). These two groups of studies were considered separately. Although there was heterogeneity between the interventions, the overall quality of the evidence was moderate. There was no clear evidence that any of the interventions were effective in reducing the number of children who died from any cause. However, there was some evidence to suggest that some interventions may be effective in preventing children from becoming addicted to tobacco.
We found three studies with a total of 451 participants. Two studies compared dexamethasone to placebo, and the third study compared a number of additional interventions in various combinations, including metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, tropisetron, and dexametron. The duration of the studies ranged from seven to 14 days. We included two studies (127 participants with data at eight days) with data for nausea intensity; no data were available that incorporated the same outcome measures for the meta-analysis. Corticosteroid therapy (Treatment with corticosteroids to reduce swelling, pain, and other symptoms of inflammation) was associated with a significant reduction in the number of participants who experienced nausea and vomiting at the end of the study, but there was no clear difference between the two treatments in terms of side effects. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of any of these drugs for the prevention of nausea or vomiting in people with schizophrenia. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of high-risk children using antibiotics to prevent LRTIs. Three studies included HIV-infected children (n = 1345), four studies included cystic fibrosis and one study included sickle cell disease, cancer and low birth weight neonates. The duration of the studies ranged from seven days to seven years. The studies were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) and schools. The evidence is current to May 2015. The results of this review are based on 10 RCTs of high risk children using antibiotic to prevent laryngitis in children with underlying respiratory disorders. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics for the prevention of laryngeal larynx infections in children. There was no evidence of a difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics in the number of children who developed laryngesis (a narrowing of the airways in the lungs) and the number who developed pneumonia (a serious complication of the lungs). There was not enough evidence to determine whether or not antibiotics are effective in preventing the development of other serious complications, such as pneumonia, bronchopulmonary arrest, or death from any cause. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The main limitations of the included studies were the small number of studies and the small numbers of children included in the studies.
We included nine randomised controlled trials, randomising 519 participants, comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum: nitrous oxide (three trials), helium (five trials), or room air (one trial), or carbon dioxide (100 participants) or both. Three trials randomised participants to nitrous oxides (two trials) and one trial randomised people to carbon dioxide. We found no difference in the number of people who died or were admitted to intensive care units (i.e. intensive care unit (ICU) or intensive care ward) when compared to people who were treated with room air. The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of people included in the trials. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Fourteen studies were included in this review. Eight studies enrolling a total of 303 participants investigated the cumulative dosage administered; three studies compared a high versus a moderate dose and five studies a moderate versus a low cumulative dose. Analysis of the studies investigating a moderate dexamethasone dose versus a high-dosage regimen showed an increased risk of BPD (typical risk ratio 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.22; typical risk difference (RD) 0.03 to 0.49; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4.9 to 23.3; I² = 0%, 2 studies, 55 infants) as well as an increase in the number of adverse events (i.e. headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, and abdominal pain) in the high-dose group compared to the low dose group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of death or serious adverse events. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low.
This review included eight randomised controlled trials involving 996 people. Researchers compared several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone aspirin, hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin versus no treatment. Six trials were conducted between 1950 and 1965; one was done in 1990 and the final study was published in 2000. The evidence is current to May 2015. The review found that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was superior to placebo in reducing the number of people with moderate-to-severe pain. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of side effects. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. There was not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of corticotropic drugs for the treatment of moderate- to severe pain.
We included six studies with a total of 12,294 participants from 79 communities. Two studies that assessed insecticide spray as a fly control measure found that trachoma is reduced by at least 55% to 61% with this measure compared to no intervention. However, another study did not find insecticides spray to be effective in reducing the incidence of trachomas. Another study found that a modest health education programme with modest water (essential for most animal and plant life) provision reduced the number of people with trachomatous skin by 29.5% compared with no intervention; this was, however, not statistically significantly different and findings have not been confirmed by a more recent study.
Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment favoured CBT, with 40% of CBT participants showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.60 to -0.76). Findings at follow-up were inconsistent (Not in agreement). CBT was more effective than usual care in reducing fatigue at the end of treatment. CBT did not appear to have an effect on the number of people who had to return to work or school.
This review included one randomised controlled study including 46 people with sickle cell disease. Of the 46 enrolled participants, seven withdrew before randomisation leaving 39 participants who were randomised to receive oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or placebo (n = 20) for six weeks and were follow-up up to six months. Two participants from the treatment group have missing values of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow up. The number of samples analysed in this review was too small to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of vitamin D for people with HbSS, HbSC and HbSβ+thal.
This review includes only one RCT, funded by the Australia National Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship. This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause, and compare two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3) and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (RSTT). This study found no significant difference between the two interventions in terms of the number of children who experienced CAS. However, there was a small increase in the proportion of children in the RSTT group who did not need any special treatment, compared to those who did. There was no difference in the percentage of children with CAS who were admitted to hospital, or who were discharged early from the study. There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of hospital admissions, hospital stay, or admission to intensive care unit (ICU) for any of the outcomes measured in this study. The authors of the RCT did not report any adverse effects of the interventions. The evidence is current to September 2016.
Four randomised controlled trials that randomised a total of 268 participants met the inclusion criteria. In all four studies antibiotic was administered orally to adults and children. One study conducted in Brazil compared trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol over 20 months to no treatment and was judged to be at high risk of performance, detection, and attrition bias. The other three studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo (a dummy medication). We judged these three studies to be of low quality. The fourth study was conducted in the United States and compared antibiotics to placebo. We judged the quality of the evidence from this study to be moderate to low. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who died from any cause. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the outcomes measured. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We included 43 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3749 participants. Twenty-two trials (3749 participants) compared the Gamma nail with the sliding hip screw (SHS). The Gamma nail was associated with an increased risk of operative and later fracture of the femur and increased reoperation rate. There were no major differences between implants in wound infection, mortality or medical complication. Five trials compared the intramedullary hip screw with the SHS. Results for post-operative complication, mortality and functional outcome were similar in both groups. Three trials (394 participants) showed no difference in fracture fixation complication, reoperation, wound infection and length of hospital stay for proximal femoral nail (the part of the bone where the bone is attached to the bone). Five trials (623 participants) did not show any difference between implants for fracture fixation. The results for wound infection were similar between implants and SHS, but there were no differences in the number of people who had to be admitted to hospital due to wound infection. We found no evidence of a difference between the two types of hip screws in terms of the risk of complications. There was no evidence to suggest that either type of hip screw is better than the other. The overall quality of the evidence was low.
We found only one study that met our inclusion criteria. It analysed retrospective data for 47 women who received either palliative surgery (27 women) or medical management with Octreotide (n = 20) and reported overall survival and perioperative mortality and morbidity. Women with poor performance status were excluded from surgery. Although six women (22%) of the 47 women received surgery, there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of women who died or were admitted to hospital. There were no differences between the groups in the length of time women spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) after surgery. The study did not report on complications of the surgery. There was no clear evidence that either treatment was better than the other. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of either treatment for the treatment of endometrial cancer in women with endometriosis. More research is needed.
Four trials met the inclusion criteria for inclusion in this review. They comprised a total of 244 women with PCOS receiving 12 weeks or 6 weeks of treatment. There was no good evidence that statins improve menstrual regularity, spontaneous ovulation rate, hirsutism or acne, either alone or in combination with the combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP). Nor were there any significant effects on body mass index (BMI). Statins were effective in lowering testosterone levels (nmol/L) (mean difference -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-0.97) and in reducing the number of women with acne. Statins did not appear to be effective in improving the frequency of ovulation or spontaneous menstruation, but there was no evidence that they improved the frequency or frequency of acne. There were no clear differences between statins and OCP in terms of side effects.
We found 1522 unique references, but we excluded 1330 on the basis of title and abstract. We identified only observational studies of women treated with formalin-soaked packs, interventional radiology or radiotherapy for palliative control of vaginal bleeding in women with cervical cancer. There is no evidence from controlled trials to support or refute the use of any of the proposed interventions compared with radiotherapy. Therefore, the choice of intervention will be based on local data from single-arm studies.
For primary therapy, three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified, enrolling a total of 745 patients, that investigated temozolomide in combination with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and for primary therapy alone. The evidence is current to January 2015. Temozolmide in addition to radiotherapy was associated with an increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and a reduction in overall survival (OS) in patients with GBM. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of patients who died. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with serious adverse events between the treatment groups. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of radiotherapy for the treatment of GBM in people with advanced brain cancer.
In this review, we included two studies that met our inclusion criteria. The findings of one study conducted in Cambodia provide low quality evidence that private contracts with international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for district health systems ('contracting-in') may improve health care management. In three countries, contracting-in increased use of antenatal care by 28% and use of public facilities by 14%. However, contract-in was not found to have an effect on population health outcomes (Health Outcomes Institute codes for outcome variables available (with responses from Stratis Health, 2901 Metro Drive, Suite 400, Bloomington, MN, 55425-1525; (612) 854-3306 (voice); dziegen@winternet.com). In the other study, intermittent training courses over 18 months may improve the performance of district health system managers’ performance. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of contracts for the management of health systems.
We included three studies that involved 123 people. All three studies reported on mortality, and death occurred in two studies. There was no clear evidence of a difference in mortality between treatment groups (risk ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.13 to 2.42); however, the analysis was underpowered to detect a difference between groups. Out of the 123 people treated and treated, six people died. There were no clear differences between treatment and control groups, or among treatment group and treated patients. The methods used for blinding the participants and researchers to the treatment group were not reported, but as the comparison is surgical treatment with medical treatment this bias is hard to avoid.
We found 50 randomised controlled trials (19 RCTs and 31 before-and-after studies) in 12,877 participants who had their LDL cholesterol measured. The participants were of any age with and without cardiovascular disease and the trials studied cerivastatin effects within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks. We judged the certainty of evidence for these effects to be high. When compared to fluvastatin, atorvastates and rosuvastatins, there was no difference in the number of people who dropped out of the trials due to adverse events. However, when compared to other cholesterol-lowering drugs, there were no differences in the proportion of people dropping out because of side effects. There was no clear difference between these drugs in terms of adverse events, but there were some differences between the doses of these drugs. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We included 28 studies which randomised a total of 6851 patients. Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD -0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI -0 to 0.02; I2 = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants): MD -1.04 mg/dl, 95%, and three (6 studies, 417 participants):MD -1 mg/hl, 95%. We found no difference in the number of patients who had to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) because of a blood clot in the leg. We did not find any difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients with blood clots at the time of admission to the ICU. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included 12 randomised controlled trials with a total of 703 participants. Eight trials primarily investigated the efficacy in treating PSF, of which six trials with seven comparisons provided data suitable for meta-analysis (five pharmacological interventions: fluoxetine, enerion, (-)-OSU6162, citicoline and a combination of Chinese herbs; and two non-pharmacological interventions): a fatigue intervention and a Chinese herbs intervention. The evidence is current to August 2014. We found 12 trials (three from the 2008 search and nine from the 2014 search) with 703 people with PSF. Eight of the 12 trials investigated the effectiveness in treating PSF and the remaining two trials investigated other types of PSF (e.g. fatigue). We found no evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of any of the interventions. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. We did not find enough data to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of these interventions. We were unable to combine the results of the included trials because of the small number of people included in the studies and the small size of the studies.
Three randomised trials, enrolling 74 preterm infants (outcome data available on 71 infants) evaluated 71 infants for hyperkalaemia, compared to cation-exchange resin, caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical quality. The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12, 19 and 40 infants enrolled (Hu 1999). The intervention and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991; Hu 1999). In none of the trials could we ascertain that allocation to the comparison groups was concealed. Urine output was ascertained in only one study. One study, glucose and insulin (a measure of blood glucose) was measured in one study, and in the other two studies it was assessed in two studies. In the third study, urine output was not measured in any of the studies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether cation exchange resin reduced the risk of death from any cause. The evidence is current to May 2013.
Twelve randomised controlled trials were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review. Seven trials with a variable risk of bias compared IVIg versus placebo in 623 people with PE. Five trials with 536 participants for whom the outcome was available, the mean difference in a seven-grade disability scale after four weeks was MD (MD) of change in a disability scale of change from four weeks to six weeks. In five trials with 623 participants with PE, there was no difference in the number of people who had to be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) compared with placebo. In one trial, there were no differences between the two groups in terms of the proportion of participants who were able to return to work within six months. There was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of patients who were not able to work after six months of treatment. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included 28 randomised clinical trials (9330 participants) with a total of 7597 participants in this review. In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (random-effect model: RR: RR) when compared with a routine fraction of inspirational oxygen. However, in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, there was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who died from any cause. There was no clear difference in the proportion of participants who died of any cause between the groups. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. We found no clear evidence of a difference between groups in terms of quality of life. We did not find any clear evidence that a higher fraction of inspiration was associated with a higher risk of death. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Twenty-five trials (3663 children) were eligible for inclusion for inclusion in this review. Twenty-two trials (3258 children) covering a range of antibiotics, participants, outcome measures and time point were included in the review. Two trials did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 trials for evaluation. Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias. We found moderate-quality evidence that there was no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics in the number of children who died from any cause. However, there was a small increase in the proportion of children with diarrhoea who were treated with antibiotics compared to those treated with no antibiotics. There was no clear difference in the amount of time children spent in intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. There were no clear differences in the incidence of serious adverse events between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be low to very low.
Twelve studies were included in this review, nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three before and after studies. Pooling of the seven RCTs in patients with type 1 diabetes resulted in a non-significant reduction in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 0.1 ml/min/month (95% CI 0.23 to 0.72) for patients assigned to a low protein diet (LPD) compared to a LPD diet (low protein diet) alone. There was no difference in the risk of death or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death from any cause (e.g. heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure) in the LPD group compared to the control group. There were no differences between the two groups in the number of patients who developed ESRD or died of any cause. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes.
We found 19 studies involving 3480 people. Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality, according to the van Tulder scoring system. We found that most people who had a mild brain injury made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific intervention. For moderate to severe brain injury,'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention, and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitation early after injury results in better outcomes. More intensive programmes are associated with earlier functional gains, but there was no clear difference between groups in terms of the number of people who were able to return to work and those who were unable to work. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
We included one randomised controlled trial (involving 176 women) in this review. We combined three of the group as the intervention (rooming-in group) and the fourth group acted as the control (separate care) and we analysed the results as a single pair-wise comparison. The factorial design of the trial took into account two factors, i.e. infant location in relation to the mother and the type of infant apparel. We found that there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of women who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who were discharged from the ICU. There were no differences between the groups in the length of hospital stay. There was not enough evidence to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of this intervention. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of women included in the trials.
Eight trials involving 660 participants were included in this review. Seven of the eight studies were of poor quality. Only two trials provided data for the number of participants who were dead or dependent at the end of 28 days of treatment, indicating a significantly lower rate of death and dependency in the sanchi group than in the control group (relative risk of death compared to the risk of the same event happening in another group).
We found seven randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four trials compared immediate versus delayed implant placement in 126 patients and found no statistically significant differences between the two groups. One trial compared immediate-delayed versus delayed perimplant placement in 46 patients. After 2 years, patients in the immediate implant group perceived the time to functional loading significantly shorter, were more satisfied and independent assessor rated the level of the marginal mucosa in relation to that of the adjacent teeth as more appropriate (RR = 1.68; 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.97). One trial found no significant difference between the groups in terms of satisfaction with implant placement. Two trials compared the amount of time taken for the implant to be placed in the mouth and found that immediate implant placement was no more or less effective than delayed placement. There were no significant differences in the number of patients who were satisfied with the implant placement time. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We found two randomised controlled trials comparing clioquinol (PBT1) with placebo in 36 patients and 32 had sufficient data for per protocol analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in cognition (as measured on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition (ADAS-Cog)) between the active treatment group and placebo group at 36 weeks. The difference in mean change from baseline was not statistically significant between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of the number of patients who improved their cognitive function. The quality of the evidence was low for all outcomes.
We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants, and were 22% less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (odds ratio 8.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.95 to 18.68; 8 trials, 1119 participants) compared to placebo (high-certainty evidence). The trials showed that PAH patients treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class, to walk 48 metres further in 6MWD (95% CI 3.72 to 4.72; 4 trials, 282 participants), and to be able to take part in activities of daily living. Two trials specifically included children. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the two groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very high. The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and small numbers of participants.
We included 22 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2193 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm, forearm or elbow surgery. Nine trials comparing double versus single injections showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (risk ratio (RR) of two odds) and a significant reduction in the number of participants who had to be re-admitted to hospital after surgery. We found one new trial involving 45 participants in this updated review. The trial design and conduct were generally adequate, and the most common areas of weakness were in blinding and allocation concealment. The quality of the evidence was generally high. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and small numbers of participants.
We found three studies that compared beclomethasone 200 mcg twice daily delivered by dry powder to children with mild-moderate asthma to placebo or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (placebo). The studies lasted from 7-12 months. In all three studies, a significant decrease in linear growth (height greater than two standard deviations above the mean of the appropriate reference population for the age and sex of the individual) occurred in children treated with be clomipramine therapy compared to those receiving placebo. The average decrease, calculated through meta-analysis, was -1.54 cm per year (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15, -2.94). There was no significant difference in the number of children with severe asthma who had an asthma flare-up compared to children treated with placebo. There were no significant differences in the proportion of children who had a serious allergic reaction compared to the proportion who did not have an allergic reaction. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to September 2015.
Three randomised controlled trials (139 patients) were included in this review. APD did not differ from CAPD (Portable peritoneal dialysis) in terms of mortality, risk of peritonitis, hernias, and other complications. PD was not better than CAPD, but PD switching to a different dialysis modality, switching from original PD modality to another modality and switching back to original PD was better than APD. PD did not improve the quality of life of patients with chronic kidney disease compared to CAPD. There was no difference between APD and CAPD in the number of patients who died or developed complications. There were no differences between PD and APD in any of the outcomes measured in the included trials. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
This review of 37 trials (9312 patients) found that CRT was superior to RT in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and time to recurrence (SM) in patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, CRT did not appear to be as effective as CT or IF-RT for improving quality of life. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We found 26 studies with 27 treatment groups that enrolled a total of 4893 participants. Twenty five of the studies were case series or uncontrolled long-term trials, the other was an RCT comparing two opioid drugs. Opioids were administered oral, transdermal, or intrathecal (k = 5, n = 1628), or both. Many participants discontinued due to adverse effects. The evidence is current to May 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain in adults. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants.
We found only one trial with a total of 212 participants, all with spinal cord injury and open pressure ulcers classed as stage III and stage IV. The participants were mainly male (98.2%, 106/108) with a mean age of 58.4 years in the oxandrolone group and were all male (100%, 104/104) compared with a placebo (dummy) group of 57.3 years. The trial did not provide enough information to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of ox androlone for the treatment of spinal cord injuries. We judged the quality of the evidence from this trial to be low to very low because of the small number of participants and the small size of the trial. The evidence is up-to-date as of January 2015.
We included six randomised controlled trials involving 8372 people. All trials were judged to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain. Four trials compared email to standard mail and two compared email communication to usual care. For the primary health service outcome of uptake of preventive screening, there was no difference between email and standard mail (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.24). For both comparisons (email and usual care) there were no differences between the groups for patient or caregiver uptake of screening. There were no significant differences in the number of people who used email for preventive screening compared to the usual care group. There was no significant difference in the use of email for other health service outcomes, such as health-related quality of life. There is no evidence to suggest that email is better than usual care for any of these outcomes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
This review includes 11 randomised controlled trials involving 855 participants. A total of nine studies used post-Epley postural restrictions as their modification of the Epley manoeuvre. There was no evidence of a difference in the results for post-treatment vertigo intensity or subjective assessment of improvement in individual or pooled data. Pooled data identified a significant difference from the addition of postural restriction in the frequency of Dix-Hallpike conversion when compared to the control group. In the experimental group 88.7% (220 out of 248) patients versus 78.2% (219 out of 280) in the control groups converted from a positive to negative (positive to negative) test as an outcome measure. There were no differences in the number of patients who converted to a negative (negative to positive) test when compared with patients who did not convert to a positive (positive or negative). There was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of the postural modifications in the treatment of vertigo.
Four studies (231 participants randomised) are included in the review. The studies compared different types of surgery versus various types and doses of systemic and topical steroids and antibiotics. There were three comparisons pairs: (1) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) versus systemic steroids (one study, n = 109), (2) polypectomy (complete or partial removal of a polypoid lesion from the mucosal surface) versus antibiotics (two studies, 87); and (3) ESS plus topical steroids versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroids. All participants also received antibiotics. No studies were at low risk of bias. There was no difference between the groups in the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included eight randomised controlled trials involving a total of709 participants. Seven trials were from middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America where zinc deficiency is likely to be a public health problem. Four trials compared the effect of zinc-fortified staple food with unfortified food (comparison 1), and four compared the effects of zinc in combination with other nutrients/factors with the same food containing other nutrients or factors without zinc without zinc. The trials were conducted in a variety of countries. The evidence is current to January 2015. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of zinc supplementation in the treatment of people with zinc deficiency. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate to low for the following reasons: low quality evidence suggests that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the occurrence of zinc deficiency in people with low- or moderate-quality evidence. Low quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the effectiveness and safety of the interventions.
Eleven studies involving 3060 participants were included in this review. Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens decreased overall survival and increased clinical progression (one year): risk ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.48, six studies, 2712 participants; 70 weeks: RR 1.25, 95%, three studies, 2373 participants; two years: RR 2.04, 95%. The quality of evidence is hampered by risk of bias, as well as the small number of studies included in the review.
This review included eight randomised controlled trials involving 600,000 women in the age range 39 to 74 years. Three trials with adequate randomisation did not show a statistically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality at 13 years (relative risk of death (RR 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.79 to 1.02); four trials with inadequate randomisation showed a reduction in the risk of breast cancer death at 12 years (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.78 to 1). One trial showed no difference between the two groups in the number of women who developed breast cancer by the time they reached 13 years of age. One trial found no difference in the rate of death between the groups in terms of the proportion of women with breast cancer who died by the age of 13 years. Two trials found no differences in the rates of death in the three groups. There was no clear difference between groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included four studies, with a total of 522 women, in the review. One of these studies did not report outcomes per woman randomised, and so was not included in formal analysis. Three studies only included women with PCOS (N = 122), while this was an exclusion criteria in the fourth study. One study investigated 20,000 units of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) priming compared to 10,000 hCG priming. The quality of the evidence was low. We rated all four studies as having an unclear risk of bias in more than one of the seven domains assessed, as outlined in the study protocol. There was no clear difference between priming and no priming in the number of women who had a miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy. There were no clear differences between the two groups of women in the proportion of women with a miscarriage at the end of the pregnancy. The evidence is current to May 2016.
In this review of 24 randomised controlled trials involving 10,114 women, we found no evidence to support the use of either ERT or HRT in preventing cognitive impairment in postmenopausal or other estrogen-deficient women to alleviate effects of hormone deficiency after five and four years of treatment, respectively (odds ratio 1.34, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.54 respectively) (trend favouring control in both instances). Analyses assessing the effects of treatment over time found that both ERT and HRT did not reduce the risk of cognitive impairment after five years, but ERT was more effective than HRT after four years. There was no difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of women who developed cognitive impairment over the course of treatment.
We included two studies with 880 participants in this review. Both studies lasted 12 weeks and included participants with both partially reversible and non-reversible COPD. Both included studies used the same combination of inhaled ICS/LABA (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily; FF/VI) versus LAMA (18 mcg tiotropium; TIO). Both studies were published as full articles, and neither study was at low risk of bias in all domains. Compared to the TIO arm, result for pooled primary outcomes for the FF/ VI arm was similar. The difference between the two studies was not statistically significant. There was no difference in the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event between the groups. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
This review included four short-term randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 169 participants. The evidence is current to January 2016. Two pharmacotherapy and three psychotherapy trials were eligible for inclusion in the review, with data from a single placebo-controlled trial (67 participants) available for analysis. Response data from the two pharmacotherapy trials suggested overall superiority of fluoxetine and clomipramine over placebo in terms of symptom severity, as well as in the two CBT trials. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced in the RCTs of fluxetine compared to placebo (relative risk 3.07, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.72, n = 67). Side effects were not reported in any of the studies. The review authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antidepressants for the treatment of depression.
Three randomised controlled trials that examined cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and involving 268 adults were included in this review. These studies found a beneficial effect of using a desensitization protocol over a rechallenge protocol at six months of follow-up for preventing discontinuation of cotrioxazoles. In the small trials included in the review, when compared to rechallenges, the number of people who needed to be treated with cotrifostigmine (number needed to treat (NNT) 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.03-9.09) had a lower incidence of overall hypersensitivity, and for a lower number of side effects, compared to the rechallenging protocol. No severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred for either protocol in the three studies. There was no difference between the two protocols in terms of number of patients who developed side effects. However, there were no serious side effects reported in any of the studies. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 148 preterm infants. Using different sedation scales, each study showed a statistically significantly higher sedation level in the midazolam group than in the placebo group (WMD 5.4 days, 95% CI 0.40 to 10.5 days). The duration of NICU stay was significantly longer in the sedation group compared with the placebo. However, we could not ascertain the effectiveness of sedation in this population because none of the scales used have been validated in preterm babies. We found no new trials for this update.
Twelve randomised controlled trials involving 767 participants were included in this review. No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants); very low quality evidence). No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhoeal symptoms at five to seven days after the end of treatment (RR 1.85; 95% CI 0.75 to 2.21) or for the length of hospital stay (RR 2.00; 95%) after treatment. The overall quality of the evidence was very low.
We included 23 studies (n = 4192) assessing the accuracy of IL-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill adult patients. The included participants were heterogeneous in terms of age, gender, main diagnosis, setting, country, and origin of infection, among other factors. We considered all studies to be at high risk of bias due to issues related to the index test domain in QUADAS-2. The SROC curve showed a great dispersion in individual studies accuracy estimates (21 studies, 3650 adult patients). Prevalence of septicaemia varied across studies, ranging from 12% to 78%.
We included 29 randomised controlled trials (5718 participants). All studies except one were at an unclear or high risk of bias. Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported. There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures with a 'clean' classification; the remaining 25 studies included people undergoing what was considered 'contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Four trials compared a basic wound dressing with no wound dressing (wound exposure); the remaining five trials compared different wound dressings with different contamination classification. The majority of the studies compared a contact dressing (the material used for dressing the wound) with a non-contact dressing. There was no difference between the two types of wound dressing in terms of the number of people who died or had serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
We found two randomised controlled trials that compared oral selenium tablets with placebo. One trial compared oral 100 microgram (µg) yeast tablets taken from the first trimester until birth with placebo, but outcome data were only provided for 85 women. Eighty-three women were randomised to each arm of the trial. The other trial randomised 179 women, 44 of whom completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Sixty-one women completed the yeast tablets arm and 61 completed the placebo arm. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of women who experienced postnatal depression. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the proportion of women experiencing postpartum depression. However, there was no difference in the percentage of women reporting postnatal anxiety or depression in either group. The trials did not provide enough data to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of selemenium tablets in preventing post-pregnancy depression.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anthracycline therapy in adults with solid tumours. We found 11 studies with a total of 5280 participants. The majority of participants included in these studies were adults with different solid tumour types. Seven studies were RCTs addressing different infusion duration (803 participants), and 4 evaluated different peak dose or value (5280 participants). The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands. The evidence is current to January 2016. We identified 11 studies: 7 evaluated different infusion lengths (six hours or longer), and 5 studies addressed different peak doses (6 hours to 12 hours). We identified one study with long-term follow-up data for one of the trials in this update. The studies showed a statistically significant lower rate of clinical heart failure with an infusion duration of six hours (risk ratio 0.27; 95% confidence interval (RR) 0.09 to 0.81; 5 studies; 557 participants). We found no difference in the risk of death or serious adverse events between the groups. We did not find any differences in the number of people who died or developed serious side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. We were unable to combine the results of the included studies, so we could not draw any firm conclusions about the effect of different peak dosage or duration of treatment. We also found no clear differences between the studies in the rate of death, serious adverse effects, or in the length of hospital stay. We could not combine the data from the included in our meta-analysis because the studies were small and did not provide enough information for us to be able to combine their results.
We included 37 randomised controlled trials with a total of 3110 randomised participants; nine of these were new studies since the last update (2009) and five studies had been previously excluded but were re-assessed and included during the 2017 update. Studies included both adults and children with TBI. Most studies commenced treatment immediately on admission to hospital or after craniotomies and all treatment was maintained for at least 24 hours. We identified two ongoing studies from searches of clinical trials and two studies await classification. Thirty-three studies reported data for mortality (all deaths reported in a given population), 31 studies reported on the number of people who died and one study reported on adverse events. The evidence is current to May 2017. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of TBI in adults or children. The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. There was insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the treatment, safety, or cost-effectiveness of these treatments.
Three high-quality and three low-quality studies, involving 519 people with depression, were identified. The studies were very heterogeneous in terms of interventions, participants, and measuring instruments. Despite fairly good methodological quality and positive findings of some studies, evidence for the effectiveness of family therapy for depression did not exceed level 3 (limited or conflicting evidence), except for moderate evidence (level 2), base on the non-combined findings from three studies, indicating that family therapy is more effective than no treatment or waiting list condition on decreasing depression intensity, and on increasing family functioning.
Three trials involving a total of 206 participants were included, all patients with vascular dementia. All three included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. When analysing these trials together, there was a significant beneficial effect of Duxil on the improvement of cognitive function measured by MMSE (WMD 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.66). No data on behaviour and death at the end of treatment and follow-up were available from the included trials. Two trials failed to show an improvement of functional performance measured by ADL. Behaviour disturbance, quality of life, and caregiver burden were not undertaken in the included studies. Due to the low quality of the evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the long-term effects of this drug.
Seven randomised controlled trials including 960 participants were identified. The quality of the evidence was generally low, with several studies at risk of selection bias, and no studies used blinding during treatment or outcome assessment. The mean difference in length of hospital stay, reported in four trials consisting of 600 participants, was 0.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.91, P = 0.03) in favour of a reduced incidence of seroma formation in participants with drainage and no drainage groups. There was no significant difference in infection rates between participants with and without drainage. There were no significant differences in the number of people who developed seroma in the two groups of participants. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of drainage for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
Eight studies with 390,769 participants were included. Five studies used a prospective cohort design, two were case-control studies and one was a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The methodological quality was measured using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The results form the studies assessing association between flavonoid intake, colorectal cancer and adenomas were contradictory. The evidence for Isoflavones, Flavonols, Flavones and Flavanones was of medium quality, and two studies were of medium methodological quality. There was no evidence that total flavonoids intake reduced the risk of colon cancer or adenoma, but there was some evidence that it may have reduced the incidence of adenomatous neoplasms. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
We included seven trials with 1369 participants. Five trials used our first definition of slow responders, and three other trials (including one that used both definitions) used the second definition. None of the included trials mentioned our primary outcomes. However, regarding the secondary outcomes, extension of the treatment period to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response according to both definition (71/217 (32.7%) versus 52/194 (26.8%) and risk ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.92, P = 0.02, I2 = 8); and 265/499 (53.1%) versus 207/496 (41.7%). We found no evidence of a difference between the two definitions in terms of the number of people who responded to the treatment. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants included in the trials and the high risk of bias.
Only two studies (34 participants) met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. Both studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EUS in assessing the resectability with curative intent in pancreatic cancer. There was low concerns about applicability for most domains in both studies. The overall risk of bias was low in one study and unclear or high in the second study. The summary estimate of sensitivity for EUS for unresectability was 60.5% (that is 61 out of 100 patients who had resectable cancer after CT scan had unresectable disease on laparotomy).
We found 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharyngitis and 14 studies (12 RCTS and 2 CCTS) included 508 participants with posterior blepharengitis. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the skin, but the quality of the evidence was limited due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses, comparisons, and comparisons of participants was limited.
We found one randomised controlled trial with a total of 23 participants. This study was at high risk of bias. There was no significant difference between the groups (very low-quality evidence). Adverse effects reported included airway swelling requiring intubation in a child with severe RRP a few hours after photodynamic therapy. There is insufficient evidence from high-quality controlled trials to support the use of photodynamic treatment for the treatment of RRP.
We found 42 studies with 4220 participants. Twenty studies provided accuracy data based on the number of individual participants (seven of which provided data with and without the use of contrast). Sixteen of these studies evaluated the accuracy of CDUS. These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of the studies, the delay between the tests was unclear or longer than four weeks; in eight (50%), the blinding of either the index test or the reference standard was not clearly reported or was not performed; and in two studies (12%), the interpretation of the reference standards was not clear. Eleven studies evaluated CE-CDUS, and these studies were of better quality than the CDUS studies. There was no clear difference between the two types of tests in terms of accuracy. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We included seven studies, with 766 participants: four used intracutaneous injections, two subcutaneous injections and one both. All reported on low back pain in labour only. There was no significant difference between sterile water and saline for rates of caesarean section, but there was a greater reduction in pain for sterile water. However, failure to demonstrate a normal distribution for pain intensity or relief, and use of different scales, meant meta-analysis was inappropriate. No study reported primary dichotomous efficacy outcomes.
Twelve randomised controlled trials with a total of 1932 participants were included in this review. The overall postoperative pain in the glue group was reduced by 37% compared with the suture group. However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh. Subgroup analysis of included studies using lightweight mesh showed the reduction of chronic pain was less profound and insignificant (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82). Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups (OR 1.38, 95-CI 0.50 to 1.91; 10 studies, 1418 participants, low-quality evidence) compared with suture. The number of people who had a recurrence of pain was the same between the glue and suture groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the number of patients who needed to be re-admitted to hospital. The quality of the evidence was low.
We found 32 studies addressing technical editing and 66 surveys of reference accuracy. Only three of the studies were randomised controlled trials. More intensive editorial processes were associated with fewer errors in abstracts and references in two studies and improved reporting quality in another two studies, while another study showed mixed results after stricter editorial policies were introduced. Providing instructions to authors was associated with improved reporting of ethics requirements in one study and fewer errors and fewer references in another study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of authors who were satisfied with the quality of their work. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We included 15 studies including 721 participants with cancer pain due to diverse types of malignancy. All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children. The included studies were of adequate methodological quality, but all except for one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because of missing data or high withdrawal rates. Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period, but only one reported results for treatment periods separately. Twelve studies used codeine as a single agent and three combined it with paracetamol (analgesic painkiller). We found no evidence that codeine was more effective in relieving cancer pain than paracetemol. We found that the use of codeine did not seem to be associated with an increase in the number of people who dropped out of the study due to side effects. We did not find any evidence of a difference between codeine and other painkillers in terms of the proportion of participants who stopped taking codeine because of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as low or very low because of the low number of included studies, and because of issues with the methods used to deal with missing data.
This review included 12 randomised controlled trials (11 randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized trial) of 563 people with HbSS, HbSC or HbSβthal, aged six to 35 years old, were included in the review. Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks. The majority of participants were African-American; the majority of the studies were conducted in the United States. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review authors found no evidence to support or refute the use of these interventions for the treatment of people with high blood pressure. However, the quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies.
This review included six randomised controlled trials involving 2411 participants. Only one study included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizures; the other five trials included people with focal onset seizures only. Participants receiving brivaracetam add-on were significantly more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in the number of seizures compared to those who received standard treatment. The duration of treatment ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. One study did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol, and another did not describe how blinding was maintained. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included 38 studies, mostly from high-income countries, many of which explored mothers' perceptions of vaccine communication. Some studies focused on the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine decisions among some parents (moderate confidence). In general, parents wanted more information than they were getting (high confidence in the evidence). Lack of information led to worry and regret about vaccination decisions among parents. Parents wanted balanced information about vaccination. We found no evidence of a difference between the MMR and rubella vaccines in the proportion of parents who were satisfied with the information they received. However, parents who received the MMR vaccine were more likely to be satisfied with their information than those who received rubella vaccine. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We identified 10 trials, with a total of 599 anorexia nervosa participants, and included them in the review. Two of the 10 trials included children, and six ongoing trials are new for this update. Trials tested diverse psychological therapies and comparability was poor (below the standard of the community). Risks of bias were mostly evident through lack of blinded outcome assessments (in 60% of studies) and incomplete data reporting (attrition bias). We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible to be included in this review, and we now include three new trials. The results suggest that treatment with psychosocial therapies may be effective in reducing the number of anorexic episodes in children, but the quality of the evidence was poor. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological therapies are effective in the treatment of adults. The quality of evidence is low.
This review included three randomised controlled trials involving 516 participants. One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane gas (C3F8) gas (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 151 adults to receiving either sulfur hexafluoride gas (Sulfur hexa) gas or sulfur hexa gas (CSG) gas. The third trial included a total of 516 adults. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that silicone oil and perflurpropane tamponade were associated with a reduction in the number of women who experienced vaginal bleeding. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of the length of time it took for women to return to normal menstruation. There was no difference in the amount of time women had to wait for their menstrual cycle to return. There were no clear differences between the groups in the proportion of people who experienced bleeding at the end of the menstrual cycle. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of participants in the included trials and the small numbers of women included in the trials. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of these products.
We included five studies (involving 1819 women) in this review. Planned early delivery was associated with a low risk of composite maternal mortality and severe morbidity for women randomised to receive planned early delivery (risk ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies, 1459 women). There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week (Gestational age and days, e.g.) or condition. There was a higher risk of HELLP syndrome (high blood pressure) for women who received early delivery compared to women who did not receive early delivery. However, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of the number of women who had to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or who were discharged early from the hospital. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
Six studies (including 142 participants) were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two studies compared three-times-a-week prophylactic administration with on-demand treatment in children with hemophilia A; one study showed a statistically significant decrease in frequency of joint bleeds with the intervention compared to placebo, with a rate of -10.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.76) for all bleeding and 0.22 (CI 0.63) for joint bleeding favouring the intervention. Three of the remaining four studies evaluated the number of patients with preserved joints after three to seven years of follow-up were not pooled due to significant heterogeneity in the results of these studies. Two of the studies showed a rate ratio of 0.73 (CI -0.14 to -1.06) for bleeding with the administration of three times a week versus placebo. One study showed no significant difference between the intervention and placebo groups in the rate of joint bleeding. The remaining two studies did not show a significant difference in the proportion of patients who had preserved joints compared to those who did not have preserved joints. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and small numbers of participants.
We included 13 trials involving 1824 participants in this review. We were unable to pool data for any of the outcomes due to the difference between the interventions assessed in the studies. Inadequate reporting of study methodology was a common feature of the trials preventing the thorough assessment of study results. We could not combine data from 10 trials (732 participants). We found one new study in this update. In this new study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: one group received no treatment and the other group received one treatment group. The participants were followed up for at least six months after the end of the study. We found no evidence that either treatment group had an effect on the number of participants who died or on the length of hospital stay. There was no evidence of a difference between treatment groups in terms of the proportion of people who died, number of days in hospital, length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU) or number of hospital admissions. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly because of the small number of trials included in the review and the small numbers of participants in the included trials.
Two studies involving 447 RhD negative women were included in this review. In both studies the women received a 1500 IU (300 microgram) dose of Rhophylac during week 28 of gestation. There was no incidence of RhD alloimmunization in either of the studies, as the sample size was insufficient for mean comparison of this uncommon outcome. However, from two to three weeks there was an increase in anti-D IgG concentrations after IV and IM administration, but there was no difference in the number of women who developed RhD by the end of the first week of pregnancy.
Eight studies with a total of 21,379 patients with diabetes were included in this review. Three included studies investigated ticlopidine compared to aspirin or placebo, or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, or compared clopidogrel in combination with aspirin to aspirin alone. All trials included patients with previous CVD, except the CHARISMA trial which included patients who had multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. Overall the risk of bias of the trials was low (low to very low) and the overall quality of the evidence was low. There was no difference in the number of deaths or serious adverse events between aspirin and placebo. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who died or had serious adverse effects between the two groups. However, there was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of people who had a serious adverse event. The quality of evidence was very low for the effect of aspirin on death and serious side effects. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of aspirin for the treatment of diabetes.
Ten trials met the inclusion criteria with a total of 191 participants. Seven trials evaluated a single treatment (Pharmacotherapy consisting of a single agent, diet therapy, radiotherapy or action taken to prevent or treat disease), one evaluated a two-week intervention, one evaluated diet therapy sessions, and one evaluated action taken in combination with radiotherapy sessions. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials evaluated single treatment, diet treatment, or both. One trial evaluated a diet therapy session, and the other evaluated two weeks of action taken. The results of the trials did not show a difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of participants who died or had a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low, mainly due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants included in the trials. The overall quality of evidence was low to moderate for all outcomes.
This review included seven studies on 245 people with COPD. These included partial pressure of CO2 and O2 in arterial blood, six-minute walking distance (6MWD), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and sleep efficiency (sleep efficiency). The mean effect on 6MWD was small at 27.7 m and not statistically significant. There was no difference between groups in the number of people who were able to sleep at night and those who were unable to sleep. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. We found no evidence to support the use of nocturnal-NIPPV in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
We included four randomised controlled trials involving 1190 women. It was not possible to blind women and staff to the intervention, but for other 'Risk of bias' domains these studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to expectant management, there was no clear effect of induction of labour for suspected macrosomia on the risk of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.76 to 1.09; 1190; four trials); four trials). There were no clear differences in the number of women who had an emergency C-section rate between the induction and expectant groups, but there was a clear difference in the proportion of women having an emergency caesarian section. There was not clear difference between the groups in terms of length of stay in the labour ward, length of hospital stay, or length of time spent in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The evidence is current to January 2015.
We identified 159 randomised clinical trials with a total of 95,286 participants. Ninety-four trials reported no mortality but did not report in which intervention group the mortality occurred, and nine trials reported mortality, and 56 randomised trials reported death, but only nine trials provided usable data on mortality. There was no difference in the number of participants who died from any cause between the intervention group and the control group. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of the risk of death. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in mortality between the interventions groups. We judged the quality of evidence to be very low because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants included in the trials.
This review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Twenty two randomized controlled trials were included in the review, with a total of 296 participants for fluoxetine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine. Pharmacotherapy produced modest weight loss and weight gain in people with Parkinson’s disease. Gastrointestinal side effects, somnolence, tremor, and sweating were common, and side effects were more common with orlist at 24 to 26 weeks and at 12 to 52 weeks follow-up. Glycated hemoglobin (a measure of blood glucose levels) was reduced in people treated with fluoxets and orlistats, but not with sibutsramine, which is an anti-inflammatory drug. Side effects were common with both drugs, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and abdominal discomfort. The review authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether pharmacotherapy is effective in reducing weight gain.
Five studies involving a total of 734 participants were eligible for inclusion in this review. We assessed only one study as good quality and the other four as poor quality. No significant differences favoured VGB or CBZ in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation, but results did show a disadvantage for VGB on time to first seizure after randomisation. Compared with CBZ, VGB appeared to be more effective in reducing the number of seizures in the first six months of treatment. However, it was difficult to perform a meta-analysis by extracting aggregate data to synthesise the results as originally planned, mainly because not all studies reported the same outcomes as those chosen for the review.
We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 600 participants with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two of these trials closed prematurely due to low recruitment and did not report results. The remaining two trials evaluated 600 participants. In both studies the experimental group received G-CSF plus plerixafor and the control group received placebo. The meta-analysis of independent studies showed no evidence for differences between the experimental and control groups regarding mortality at 12 months (600 participants); risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 2.00; risk ratio 1.50, 95%. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who died from any cause. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 23 trials involving 1806 women, of whom 717 received cone therapy. Cones were better than no active treatment (rate ratio (RR) for failure to cure incontinence 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.98) and no active therapy (RR 0.94, 95%) in women with mild to moderate-quality evidence. The trials were small, and in many the quality was hard to judge. Some trials reported high drop-out rates (considered "basic consent".Examples:Healthcare: A patient declines to sign a provider's consent directive form, which lists permissible collection, access, or disclosure activities, purposes of use, and consequences of not assenting.Non-healthcare: An employee refuses to sign an employer's agreement not to join unions or participate in a strike where state law protects employee's collective bargaining rights.
Eleven trials with a total of 2246 AF patients (ranging from 14 to 712 by study) were included within the review. Studies included education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education interventions. We found small but positive effects of education on anxiety, depression, and decision aids compared with usual care. The effect of decision aids on TTR was uncertain compared to usual care (MD 6.31, 95% CI -5.63 to 18.25, 2 trials, 69 participants, very low-quality evidence). The effect of education plus education on depression was uncertain, and the effect on decision aids was uncertain. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The quality of evidence was limited by the small number of studies included in the review and the low number of participants in the included studies. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different PGE2 formulations (gels versus tablets, or sustained release pessaries) in 11,487 women. In this update, seven new RCTs (778 women) have been added. Two of these new trials (two of which compare different formulations with no treatment) and one trial (seven new trials) compare PGE1 versus no treatment, four trials (four different formulations) versus tablets (three different formulations), two trials (one different formulations, one different formulation) versus sustained release gels (two different formulations). The evidence is current to January 2016. The evidence for the use of PGE3 versus no PGE4 is limited. The quality of the evidence is very low, mainly because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of women included in the trials. The results of this review do not allow us to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of any of the different formulations.
This review included five randomised controlled trials involving 247 infants. When compared to incubator care, cot-nursing resulted in no significant difference in mean body temperature (MD 0.02 degrees C; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.07, four trials found this to be statistically more common in the cot nursing group, though the one trial that reported on episodes of hyperthermia found that this was more common when the infants were breast fed on discharge. There were no statistically significant differences in weight gain, though there were fewer infants who were breastfed on discharge (typical RR 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.09). There were also no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the number of babies who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or who were discharged from the NICU. There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of infants who had an episode of hypothermia. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included three studies, involving 146 participants. Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.06). One study, 141 participants analysed, low-quality evidence, found two complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment. One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group) and one in the open group. There was no difference between the two methods in terms of the number of patients who had to be re-admitted to hospital. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We found three randomised controlled trials, involving 244 women. The prostaglandins used were PG E2 analogue (sulprostone) in 50 participants and PG E1 analogue (misoprostol) in 194 participants at a dose of 250 mcg and 800 mcg respectively. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias because of the small number of women included in the studies and the way in which the studies were conducted. The results of the trials did not show any difference between the two drugs in reducing the rate of manual removal of placenta from the uterus (average risk ratio 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.27), severe postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97), or the rate at which the baby was removed from the womb (RR 1.00, 95%. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included six studies involving 355 infants - two using face mask CPAP, one nasal CPAP and one both CNP and endotracheal CPAP (for sicker babies). For this update, we included no new trials. Continuous distending pressure (CDP) is associated with lower risk of treat failure (death or use of assisted ventilation) (typical risk ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.81; typical risk difference (RD) -0.15). CDP is also associated with a lower overall mortality (average risk 0.29 to -1.10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5, 95-CI 5 to 10; six studies; 355 infants). There was no difference between CDP and CNP in the number of babies who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the number who were discharged from the NICU. There were no differences between the two types of CPAP in the proportion of infants who had to be admitted to NICU. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2015.
We included six studies (157 participants) in this review. All included studies were small and/or had limited follow-up times. Two studies indicated that foam dressings do not promote the healing of diabetic foot ulcers compared with basic wound contact dressings. Pooled data from two studies comparing foam and alginate dressings found no statistically significant difference in ulcer healing (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.44). There was no significant difference with hydrocolloid (matrix) dressings (RR 2.03, 95%, 95%CI 0.91 to 4.55). There were no significant differences in the number of diabetic feet ulcers healed when foam dressing was compared with other types of wound dressings, and there were no differences between the two types of dressings in the amount of time it took for the foot ulcer to heal. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of foam dressing for diabetic foot wounds.
We found three eligible randomised controlled trials. Two trials compared endoscopic intervention with surgical intervention and included a total of 111 participants: 55 in the endoscopic group and 56 in the surgical group. Surgical intervention had a higher proportion of participants with pain relief, both at middle/long-term follow-up (two to five years): risk ratio (RR 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.15) and long-term (≥ five years, RR 1.56, 95%, CI 1.18 to 3.05). The third trial compared surgical intervention with endoscopic treatment and included 111 participants. Compared with the surgical intervention, the surgical treatment group had a lower proportion of people who had pain relief at middle and long term follow up (RR 2.22, RR 2.18, RR 3.15). Surgical treatment was associated with a lower rate of side effects (i.e. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and abdominal discomfort). There was no difference between the two groups in the number of participants who had an adverse event (e.g. bleeding). There were no differences between the groups in terms of number of patients who had a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
Only one trial was identified for inclusion in this review. This trial included 857 patients undergoing minor skin excision surgery in the primary care setting. Patients were randomised to early or delayed post-operative bathing (dressing to be removed after 12 hours and normal bathing resumed) (n = 415). The only outcome (A) was the number of days of normal bathing. The wounds were sutured after the excision (removed). This trial was at a high risk of bias. There was no difference between early and delayed bathing in terms of length of time patients were able to continue to bathe after surgery. There were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of patients who needed to be re-sutured at the end of the operation. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of early bathing after minor skin surgery.
We found only one randomised controlled trial comparing prednisone with no treatment in 35 eligible participants. The trial did not measure the primary outcome for this systematic review. One participant died in the trial, and the trial had a high risk of bias. The trials did not report side effects in detail, but one participant died after 12 weeks of treatment, compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment (risk ratio for improvement 2.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.52; very low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who experienced side effects between the two groups. There were no serious side effects reported in any of the trials. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Six studies including a total of 2100 participants met the inclusion criteria: we pooled four studies including 792 people in the main efficacy analyses, and presented the results of a cluster implementation study (n = 1213) and an oral steroid tapering study separately. Baseline characteristics relating to asthma severity were variable, but studies generally recruited people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with COPD or severe obstructive bronchiolitis. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of oral steroids for the treatment of asthma in adults with asthma. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
Three out of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 212 participants. All the included studies fulfilled at least seven of 10 methodological criteria. The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.08), quality of life and aerobic capacity (CHQ-PhS: n = 115, WMD 0.96, 95-CI -8.00 to 1.19). The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy but none were statistically significant. Overall, based on'silver-level' evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) there was no clinically important or statistically significant evidence that exercise therapy is effective in improving functional ability or improving aerobic capacity.
We found 19 randomised controlled trials with 2663 participants (11 with outpatients, seven with inpatients and one with ICU patients). The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials were of low quality. The evidence suggests that antibiotics are effective in reducing the risk of treatment failure between seven days and one month after treatment initiation in patients with mild to moderate-to-severe bacterial infections. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of trials and the small numbers of patients included in the trials. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections in adults.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1414 participants (age range 24 to 70; mean age 45 to 59) comparing whole grain versus low grain or refined grain diets. All studies were in primary prevention populations and had an unclear or high risk of bias, and no studies had an intervention duration greater than 16 weeks. We found no studies that reported the effect of whole grain diets on total cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events (total myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, total stroke, and total stroke). Overall, we found no difference between whole grain and control groups for total cholesterol, blood lipids and blood pressure. We did not find any evidence that whole grain reduced the risk of heart disease, stroke, heart attack, or death from any cause. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of people who had a heart attack or died of any cause between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was low or very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants.
We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing different types of orthosis or walking casts. We found 28 studies with a total of 1896 participants. Only one study was judged at low risk of bias. Eight studies were judged at high risk of selection bias because of lack of allocation concealment and over half the of the studies were at risk of selective reporting bias. Three small studies investigated rehabilitation interventions (investigations by nurses designed to test a hypothesized cause relation by modifying the supposed causal factor in the study population) during the immobilisation period after conservative orthopaedic management. There was limited evidence from two studies (106 participants in total) of short-term benefit of using an air-stirrup versus an orthosis and a walking cast. One study (12 participants) found no evidence of a difference between the two types of cast in terms of the number of people who were able to walk at the end of the study period. The other two studies found no difference in the length of hospital stay between the groups. There were no differences in the proportion of participants who were discharged from the hospital with a disability. The quality of the evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included in the studies. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Four studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two studies were conducted in low-income countries. Two were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and two were non-randomised trials. No single intervention was evaluated by more than one trial. An RCT of a home-based nursing programme showed a positive effect of the intervention on knowledge and medication refills (p=.002), but no effect on CD4 count and viral load. A second study of caregiver medication diaries showed that the intervention group had fewer participants reporting no missed doses compared to the control group (85% vs. 92%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of participants reporting a missed dose. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was low or very low.
Five studies (696 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Participants had pain following third molar extraction, laparoscopy, minor day surgery and episiotomy. There were insufficient data to analyse other dose or active comparators, time to use of rescue medication, or numbers of participants needing rescue medication. The NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours with a single dose of fenoprofen 200 mg compared to placebo was 2.3 (1.9 to 3.0). There was no difference in the number of participants experiencing any adverse events between ffen 200mg and placebo. The number of people requiring rescue medication was similar between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was low.
Six trials were included in this update; three of these trials are new to this update. Four trials compared PFMT as a treatment for prolapse against a control group (n = 857 women); two trials were small (less than 25 women per arm) and two had moderate to high risk of bias; two trials included women having surgery for prolapses and compared a PFMT group with a control. Four of the six trials were conducted in the USA and two in the UK. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials included a total of 857 pregnant women with prolapse of the uterus. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. There was no clear difference between PFMT and no treatment in the number of women who had prolapse and the number who did not have prolapse. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the rate of women having prolapse after PFMT compared to no treatment. PFMT did not appear to be associated with an increase in the risk of having a prolapse, but there was no difference between the groups in terms of length of stay in hospital. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether PFMT is effective in preventing prolapse in women undergoing laparoscopic surgery.
Fourteen randomised controlled trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears) were included in this review. The evidence is up to date as of May 2015. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no antibiotic treatment at clearing discharge at one week, but no significant difference was found in the number of people who had to be discharged from hospital at week one or three. There was no difference in the rate of side effects between the two groups. Topicals were better at clearing the ear canal at week three, but there was no clear difference between the groups at the end of the treatment period. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of people included in the trials. There is a need for larger, well-designed, and well-conducted trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of topical antibiotics for treating CSOM.
We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants (5515 were included in the analysis). Studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's. Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS correctly identified schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%). In 16 studies, it correctly identified people with schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with an accuracy of 61% (51.8% to 71.2%) and specificity of 94.1% (88% to 97.2%). The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS clearly identifies schizophrenia from non-psychotic mental health disorders or diseases manifested by breakdowns in the adaptational process expressed primarily as abnormalities of thought, feeling, and behavior producing either distress or impairment of function.
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of which 5 were new to this update. There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational interventions and 44 in the 1 psychological study. All interventions were adjuncts to conventional therapy and were delivered in primary- and secondary-care settings. Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis), and improvement in quality of life. We did not find any evidence that educational interventions were effective in reducing the severity of asthma. We found no evidence to support the use of educational interventions to reduce the number of people with asthma who developed asthma attacks. We judged four studies to have high risk of detection bias, attrition bias, or other bias. Some included studies had methodological weaknesses; for example, we judged four of the studies to be of low risk of bias, and attrition bias. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Fourteen trials contributed to this review (753 participants). There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more likely to achieve mucosal coverage in people with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (risk ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 16.8, NNTB 4; 264 participants, 2 studies). From single studies there was a significantly increased chance of improvement or cure of wound breakdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.6, P value = 0.003, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5; 246 participants, 3 studies). There were also moderate quality studies of a significantly improved chance of wound breakage (RNB) and wound closure (RNT) with HBOT (RR 1.2, P values = 1.0 to 1.5; NNTTB 5; 247 participants, 4 studies). The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We found 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2961 surgeons performing an operation in which the use of blunt needle was compared to use of sharp needle. Four studies focused on abdominal closure, two studies on caesarean section, two on vaginal repair and two on hip replacement. On average, a surgeon that used sharp needle sustained one glove perforation in three operations compared to sharp needle perforations in three other operations. The use of a blunt needle reduced the risk of glove perfusion in one operation compared to using a sharp needle, but there was no difference in the number of gloves perforated in the other two operations. There was no significant difference between the two groups of surgeons in terms of number of wounds. There were no differences between the groups in the proportion of wounds that were closed with a sharp or a non-sharp needle. We found no differences in the percentage of gloves that were cut with a needle compared to a needle that was not sharp. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
This review included seven randomised trials involving 422 participants that compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The size of the included studies was between 20 and 157 participants with a study length between four and 52 weeks. The evidence is current to January 2016. Trifluopazine was not significantly different from low-Potency antip antipsychotics in terms of response to treatment, acceptability of treatment with equivocal number of participants leaving the studies early due to any reason, or withdrawal from the studies due to side effects. There was also no significant difference in acceptability between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate.
We found nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 593 infants in total. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. The trials were generally small and contained various methodological weaknesses including lack of blinding and incomplete assessment of all randomised participants. We found some evidence that responsive feeding reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to orally feeding (MD −1.36, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.29 g/kg/day), and provide some evidence of slightly slower rates of weight gain (MD -1.80 to −4.25 days). However, these results are limited by the small number of studies and the lack of data and availability of data. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Two randomised trials with a total of 161 participants were included in this review. One randomised trial with 133 participants showed that there was a significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI) in participants who received 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) compared with placebo (mean difference 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.11, P = 0.009). A second trial with 18 participants showed no difference in ABI in people who received folic acid compared to those who received placebo. The studies did not report on mortality and rate of limb loss. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who had to have their leg amputated. The quality of the evidence was very low.
We found two randomised controlled trials, with data from 503 dental practices, representing 821 dentists and 4771 patients. One study used a factorial design to investigate the impact of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on the placement of fissure sealants in permanent molar teeth, as assessed using the GRADE approach, and the other study used the same approach to assess the effect of the two interventions. The quality of the evidence was low/very low for all outcomes. We judged the risk of bias to be high for both studies and the overall quality of evidence to be very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We included 21 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving over 17,000 women and their babies. Trials were generally at low risk of bias. Zinc supplementation resulted in a small reduction in preterm birth (risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.97 in 16 RCTs; 16 trials did not contribute data). One trial did not report data. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of babies born preterm. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
Ten randomised controlled trials (1656 participants) met our inclusion criteria, and pharmaceutical industry funded none of these trials. All trials used probiotics as adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs. Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure and decreased relapse rate at one month, radiotherapy cure, diet therapy, and mycological cure. There was no difference between probiotics and placebo in the number of participants who had a relapse within one month of treatment. There were no differences in the proportion of patients who had an adverse event at the end of the study. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.
We included seven randomised controlled trials (involving 696 participants) in this update of the review. The included trials were conducted in different countries, covering the full spectrum of the World Bank's economic classification, which enhances the applicability of evidence drawn from this review. Four of the trials were in upper-middle income countries, two in Iran, one in Malaysia and the fourth in Turkey, and the seventh trial was conducted in Germany and Italy, which are high-income countries. Two of the seven trials were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and one by the World Health Organization (WHO). One trial was funded by a pharmaceutical company. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials included in this review included 696 people. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of people who died from any cause in any of the included trials. We did not find any evidence of any difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the proportion of participants who died. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of participants in each trial. We judged the quality of evidence to be very low or very low because of the small numbers of people included in the trials and the small size of the studies. There was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the effect of the interventions on mortality, quality of life, or cost.
We found five studies of laser photocoagulation of diabetic retinopathy (n = 83) but only five of these studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies. Three studies were conducted in the USA, one in the UK and one study in Japan. The majority of participants in four of these trials were people with diabetes. The studies were small and did not provide enough information to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this treatment. The results of this review are based on five studies with a total of 83 participants. There was no difference in the number of people who had to be treated with laser treatment compared to those who did not receive laser treatment. There were no differences in the amount of time taken for the eyes to return to normal colour or in the length of time it took for the vision to return. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We found two randomised controlled trials involving 269 participants. Both trials were conducted in China and Italy (one was a multicentre trial) and included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery (undergoing an abdominal surgical procedure). We judged both trials to be at high risk of bias. Compared to oxygen therapy, CPAP (a form of non-invasive mechanical pressure support ventilation that uses a continuous positive airway pressure level) or bilevel NPPV may reduce the rate of respiratory failure in people with acute lung failure. However, there was no clear difference between CPAP and CPAP in terms of quality of life. There were no clear differences in the number of people who had to be admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) or who were discharged from hospital. There was not enough evidence to determine whether CPAP or CPAP was better than CPAP alone in reducing the risk of death from any cause. We judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate to low.
We included four trials involving 388 women that were judged to be at an unclear to high risk of bias overall. A variety of different agents for providing analgesia were assessed in the trials. Three trials compared diazepam with an alternative agent (ketamine; vinydan-ether; "other" anaesthesic agent) for the provision of pain relief, and a number of different method to measure pain relief were used, and thus results could not be combined in meta-analysis. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials included 388 women who were having a caesarean section. There was no difference in the number of women who experienced pain relief between the diazepams and the alternative anaesthetic agents. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the four trials. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We included 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1048 participants. Most of the trials were conducted in India, followed by Europe and the United States. The majority of participants were adults of both sexes with mild to moderate asthma for six months to more than 23 years of age. Interventions lasted from two weeks to 54 months, for no more than six months in the majority of studies. Five studies included yoga breathing alone, while the other studies assessed yoga interventions that included breathing, posture, and meditation. There was some evidence that yoga may improve quality of life (MDMD) in people with asthma. However, the quality of the evidence was low across all domains. There were no clear differences between yoga breathing and other types of breathing interventions. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
This review included 10 trials (249 participants) using different treatment regimens. Seven of the 10 trials assessed single agents, and 3 assessed combined agents. Many of the studies did not present adequate data for the report of the primary outcome of the review, which was the percentage change in muscle strength score at six months of follow-up. Pooled data from two trials from two different groups of participants showed that muscle strength scores improved in the combined treatment group, and in the single agent group. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who had a significant improvement in their muscle strength at the end of six months. There were no clear differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of participants in the included trials and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 3144 participants. Linezolid was associated with a significantly better clinical cure rate in adults (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16) than vancomycin in clinical and microbiological cure rates in adults. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between linezolid and other antibiotics for those infections due to MRSA. No RCT reported SSTI-related and treatment-related mortality. There were no significant differences in the number of people who were cured of MRSA-related SSTIs. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes.
We included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 512 participants in this review. We found that there was no significant difference in survival, postoperative mortality, intraoperative blood loss, and morbidity, except of delayed gastric emptying, which significantly favoured CW, and red blood cell transfusion, which showed no significant differences. Furthermore, we noted that operating time (45.22 minutes, 95% CI -74.67 to -15.78 minutes) was not significantly different between the two groups, and there were no differences in the number of patients who required blood transfusion. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low.
Six randomised controlled trials involving 1862 participants were included in this systematic review. The effect of calcium channel blockers on the risk of death was reported in five of the six studies. Three studies reported death and severe disability as an outcome in a subgroup of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage patients, and the pooled OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.18). In the two RCTs which reported death in the two subgroups of patients, the pooled odds ratio for the five studies was 0.91. The pooled OR for the pooled results for the two studies was 1.67. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who died or suffered severe disability. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who experienced death or disability in the three studies that reported this outcome. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channels blockers for the treatment of traumatic brain injury.
We included four randomised controlled trials with a total of 3090 participants (one study used a cluster-randomized design). Three trials were considered to have a relatively low risk of bias, and one trial was considered to be at a relatively high risk. When survival to hospital discharge was compared, 38 of 320 participants survived to discharge in the initial CPR plus delayed defibrillation group compared with 39 of 338 participants (11.54%) in the immediate defibrillator group. When we compared survival to discharge with the initial chest compressions, the survival rate was similar between the two groups. There was no clear difference between the groups in terms of the number of people who died. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of participants included in the trials, and the small numbers of participants in each trial.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of gonadotrophins and GnRH antagonists. We found fifteen trials. Three trials were eligible for inclusion for inclusion in this review. Ten trials involving eight different comparison groups have been included. The number of oocytes retrieved were significantly less in the conventional GnRHa long protocol compared to stop protocol. Only one trial reported live birth rates. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of women who had a live birth rate. There were no differences between the groups in the proportion of women with ovarian cancer who had an ovarian cyst removed. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of GnRH antagonist therapy in the treatment of ovarian cancer.
This review includes 53 randomised controlled trials, with a total of 53 studies. Family intervention may decrease the frequency of relapse (n = 2981, 32 RCTs, RR 0.55 CI 0.5 to 0.6, NNT 7 CI 6 to 8), although some small but negative studies might not have been identified by the search. Family interventions may also reduce hospital admission and encourage compliance with medication, but it does not seem to affect the tendency of individuals/families to leave care. There is no clear evidence that family interventions are effective in reducing the number of people with COPD who relapse. The quality of the evidence is very low.
Three randomised controlled trials with 263 participants met the review criteria. These trials were carried out in Germany and Austria and used paclitaxel as the agent in the drug-eluting balloons. Two of the three trials were industry sponsored. All three trials examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis within the femoropopliteal arteries. Two companies manufactured the drugs that were used in the trials (Eurocor and Eurocor, Bonn, Germany) and the third trial was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The trials were conducted in Germany, Austria, and the USA. The evidence is current to January 2016. The three trials included 263 participants. Two trials compared the use of drug-eletting balloons with no treatment, and one trial compared the treatment with a drug-emulsifying balloon. The third trial compared drug-delivery balloons with placebo. There was no difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of participants who died. There were no differences between the treatment groups for any of the outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether drug-editing balloons are more effective than placebo for treating symptomatic symptomatic stenosis in the femoral arteries. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants in the included trials.
Seven randomised controlled trials with a total of 922 participants were included in this analysis. Trials ranged from 32 to 242 participants. On pooled analysis, corticosteroids reduced the duration of fever, time for laboratory parameters (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to normalise (MD −1.65 days, 95% CI −3.31 to 0.46; 907 participants; 7 studies; I² = 55%) without resultant serious adverse events and mortality (no events, 915 participants). Corticosteroid treatment also reduced the occurrence of coronary artery abnormalities and the subsequent occurrence of heart attacks and strokes. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included eight studies with 846 participants. Four studies involved comparisons of PIP with another treatment group (i.e. another PIP, video-interaction, parent guidance, psychoeducation, counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy), two of these studies included a control group in addition to an alternative treatment group. Samples included women with postpartum depression (Depression in POSTPARTUM WOMEN, usually within four weeks after giving birth), anxious or insecure or insecure attachment, maltreated, and prison populations. We assessed potential bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, incomplete outcome that can be measured). We found no evidence that PIP was more effective than other forms of psychosocial support. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We found one new included study in this updated version of the review. In total, we included 11 trials (with 753 participants). The low quality of evidence showed that in comparison to room air, women in labour receiving supplementary oxygen had higher maternal oxygen saturation at one minute, maternal PaO2 at five minutes and maternal Apgar scores at one, two, three and five minutes. However, there was no significant difference in the number of babies born alive at the end of labour. None of the 11 trials reported maternal desaturation (bound to hemoglobin low) and none of the studies reported any adverse effects. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included twelve studies containing data on 2196 participants; four of these studies were newly included in this 2011 update of our 2006 Cochrane review. Reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken (mean difference 11% (MD 11% to 17% in four trials) in four studies, but there was no difference in the number of people who dropped out of the studies due to side effects. There was no clear difference between the groups in terms of the proportion of people dropping out because of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dizziness, and dizziness. There were no clear differences in the amount of time taken for people to return to work or school. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. The evidence is current to May 2011.
We found 15 randomised controlled trials evaluating 11 different pharmacological interventions (methylprednisolone, multivitamin antioxidant infusion, vitamin E infusion, amrinone, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, mannitol, trimetazidine, dextrose, allopurinol, and OKY 046). All trials had high risk of bias. There were no significant differences between the groups in mortality, liver failure, or perioperative morbidity. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the treatment groups. The treatment group had a significantly shorter hospital stay than control (MD (MD) 046), and the treatment group was less likely to have a stroke (MD 046) than the control group. However, there was no difference between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who died or had a stroke. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether any of these interventions are effective in preventing stroke.
We included 61 studies; 46 for prevalence of kidney disease, six for both prevalence and risk factor, and nine not meeting the inclusion criteria, but assessing risk factor. In total, we included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the prevalence of chronic kidney disease. The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies, received treatment, reported outcome measure, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very high, mainly due to the small number of studies and small numbers of participants. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Two trials (182 participants) and two phytomedicines Niprisan® (also known as Nicosan® and Ciklavit®) were included in this review. The single trial of Cajanus cajan reported a possible benefit to individuals with sickle cell disease. No serious adverse effects were reported. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of any of these drugs for the treatment of acute episodes of severe painful crises.
We found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1999 participants. Two trials compared standard treatment, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (chemotherapy) versus standard treatment alone. One trial was published in abstract form only; hence, detailed assessment of the risk of bias was not possible. We judged the overall potential potential of bias as moderate. The studies were reported as RCTs; blinding was not reported, but given the study design it is likely that there was no blinding (no blinding). One study was published as a single citation covering papers or abstracts presented at a meeting, and the other two trials were published as single citations. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials compared the use of standard treatment versus standard therapy alone, chemotherapy, or both. We found that standard treatment appeared to be more effective than chemotherapy alone in terms of reducing the number of people who died from any cause. However, there was not enough evidence to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of either treatment alone on mortality or quality of life. There was no clear difference between standard treatment and chemotherapy alone when it was compared to standard treatment plus radiotherapy alone. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We rated the overall quality of evidence as moderate, meaning that we are very uncertain about the certainty of the results.
We found 31 trials that met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and the few differences from levonorgestrel-containing COCs; others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. None included a placebo. Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome (specifically, the number of women who had a period). Twelve trials studied desogestrel (a synthetic progestogenic hormone used often as the progestogen component of combined oral contraceptive agents). None of the trials reported on side effects. No new trials were eligible in 2014. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this review. We found that seven of the 10 included RCTs had a low risk of bias. However, the results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias as none of the trials were able to blind participants to treat or prevent treatment allocation and, while most studies reported blind outcome assessment assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self reported. One of the studies was only reported as a conference abstract and did not provide sufficient data for the evaluation of bias, so we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of this intervention. The evidence is current to May 2016. We did not find any evidence to support or refute the use of NOCI for the treatment of people with NCCI. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be moderate to low.
We found nine high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 260 participants. Six trials focussed on comparison of exercise therapy versus no exercise therapy, whereas three trials compared two interventions that both met our definition. Exercise therapy improved muscle power function, exercise tolerance functions, exercise capacity, endurance and mobility-related activities, but there was no evidence that exercise therapy improved mood. Moderate evidence was found for improving mood, but no evidence was observed for exercise therapy therapy in terms of muscle power, endurance or mobility. No evidence was seen for improvement of muscle strength, endurance, mobility or muscle strength tolerance. There was not enough evidence to be able to draw any conclusions about whether exercise therapy is effective in improving mood. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
Only one randomised controlled trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females): 65% of participants, randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) (n = 35) and 40 people (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) were included in this review. Information on serious adverse events was available for 68 participants (28 people in the early and 40 in the delayed group). Information on the outcome of mortality was not available for the 75 participants. The trial had a high risk of bias, which means that the results may not be reliable.
We found 11 randomised controlled trials. Seven of these trials provided evidence for the main comparison and the primary outcome and these were pooled. Overall, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of SSI compared with a single dose (220 participants; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.74; moderate-quality evidence). However, there is uncertainty surrounding the relative effects of short-term antibiotics compared with single doses (472 participants). There is a need for more high-quality randomised trials.
We found only one randomised controlled trial, involving 40 infants and 42 women. There were no significant benefits or adverse effects of caesarean section and caesarean section for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks and 0 days gestation) at 36 weeks' gestation for fetal gastroschisis. The trial was underpowered to detect clinically important differences between the two policies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there were any differences in the number of babies who survived or died in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of babies born alive at the end of the intervention period compared to those born at the start of intervention period. The study did not report any adverse effects. There is a need for more well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported studies to assess the benefits and harms of the interventions in the management of preterm births.
Three studies in adults satisfied the inclusion criteria, lasting up to one week; 122 participants were randomised initially, and 95 completed treatment. All used paracetamol as an add-on to established treatment with strong opioids (median daily doses of 60 mg, 70 mg, and 225 mg, with some participants taking several hundred mg of oral morphine daily). Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs included NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants, or neuroleptics. One study was parallel-group, and two had a cross-over design. All studies were at high risk of bias. We found no studies in children. The evidence is current to January 2016. Paracetamols are a painkiller that is used to relieve pain in adults with chronic pain. They are commonly used in the treatment of chronic pain, such as pain in the neck, neck pain, back, shoulder, and back pain, and pain in other parts of the body such as the head, neck, chest, and abdomen. There is no evidence to support or refute the use of paracetams for pain relief in people with acute pain. However, there is not enough evidence to recommend their use in adults.
This review identified 15 randomised controlled trials, 14 of which were conducted in China and 14 in hospitals. The quality of reporting was poor with no studies clearly describing allocation concealment and much data were missing or unusable. Antimuscarinics (astemizole, diphenhydramine, propantheline, doxepin) were the most commonly evaluated drugs. Most frequently the primary outcome was the diameter of the wet patch on the pillow. For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement' astemizole and diphenHydramine were more effective than a placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) in improving the quality of sleep. However, there was no clear difference between the two drugs in terms of improvement in the number of hours that the patient slept at night. There were no clear differences between the drugs in the amount of time that the person slept in bed at night or in the length of the bed. There was no difference in the time taken for the person to get back to sleep. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs for the treatment of insomnia.
We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 195 participants with MS. Two RCTs investigated inspiratory muscle training with a threshold device (high-intensity, low-repetition exercises designed to promote muscle strength in the expiratory muscle) and one RCT investigated regular breathing exercises. We pooled data of 5 trials (N=137) for both inspiratory and expiratories muscle training, using a fixed-effect model for all but one outcome. Eighteen participants (˜ 10%) dropped out; trials reported no serious adverse events. Compared to no active control, there was no difference in the number of participants who dropped out of the studies. There was no significant difference between the two types of muscle training in terms of muscle strength. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who were able to walk at the end of the study. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
This review included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which 38 women (41 pregnancies) were randomised, with only 26 women (28 pregnancies) being analysed. This RCT compared the effect of betamethasone (1.5 mg/day) with no medication. There was no statistically significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia, perinatal mortality, or neonatal bleeding. The authors conducted an intention-to-treat analysis which showed similar findings: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 2.61, respectively.
We found two completed studies, with a total of 111 participants (n = 30 and n = 81), that met our inclusion criteria. Participants had moderate to severe keratoconus pre-operatively and were randomly allocated to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty (Partial or total replacement of the cornea from one human or animal to another). Only one eye of each participant was treated as part of the trials. The smaller study had 12 months follow-up data for all participants, four DALK surgeries had to be abandoned due to technical failure and visual and refractive outcomes were not measured in these participants. Follow-up length (12 months) was not reported in the larger study. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of participants who were able to return to work within 12 months of the end of the study. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 67 randomised controlled trials (from 76 reports), recruiting 8506 women; the number of women included in analyses varied greatly between outcomes, with the largest number of participants analysed (6861 women). Only 10 studies were considered at low overall risk of bias, with most studies presenting insufficient details about trial quality. Women receiving iron supplements were significantly less likely to be anaemic at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (risk ratio (RR ratio) 55.85). However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of haemoglobin concentration. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Five randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,726 patients were included in this review. Among five included studies, no reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in the combination chemotherapy arm, with a summary hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53-0.87), however, this result may have been driven by findings from the single first-line treatment setting study. Longer progression-free survival (length of time during and after the treatment) was observed with the combination treatment in those treated with the chemotherapy (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.02). The quality of evidence for overall survival was rated as moderate to very low. There was no difference in the number of deaths between the two treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who died from any cause between the combination and the control groups. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
In this review, we found evidence to suggest that a transverse or oblique incision has less impact on pulmonary function particularly in the early post-operative period and is less prone to rupture (wound dehiscence/incisional hernia). The data on pain is less clear and should be interpreted with caution but some data suggests a transversal incision is less painful. There was no difference seen in other early or late post-operations complications and recovery times were similar although the transverse incision was less likely to rupture than the oblique or parallel incision. There were no differences seen in the number of people who needed to be admitted to hospital for any reason. Due to the differences in the method of assessment, the variability of data and the heterogeneity of the participant groups it was difficult to pool some of the outcome data.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 981 participants in this review. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. The average age of participants ranged from 33 to 351. All included studies were judged as having high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and four of the nine studies suffered from at least one additional source of possible bias. In MBR compared to usual care for subacute LBP, individuals had less pain (four studies with 336 participants) and less disability (three studies with 240 participants); SMD -0.21, moderate-quality-quality of evidence due to low risk of detection of bias) and more disability (two studies with 362 participants; SMD-0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0 to 0.70, moderate quality of evidence). We found no evidence that MBR was associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference between MBR and usual care in the number of people who had a stroke. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 4843 participants comparing the effect of bisphosphonate administration to control regimen. We found no clear difference in the proportion of participants with pain response (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.43; P = 0.20; 3 trials; 876 participants); low quality evidence; low-quality evidence; and low risk of bias. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We found five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1093 patients. All trials were reported as randomised and judged to be open-label studies, because usually trials are not blinded. Four trials in previously untreated patients and one trial in relapsed patients were included in this review. Overall, the quality of the five trials evaluating stem cell transplantation was rated to be moderate. Due to the small number of studies in each analysis (four or less), the quantification of the effect of stem cell transplants was not possible. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of patients who had a recurrence of the disease when compared to those who had not had any treatment. There were no clear differences between the two groups of patients in terms of quality of life. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results of the trials.
We included 15 randomised trials (1437 participants) of WDD for schizophrenia. Data showed WDD improved the short-term global state of participants compared with antipsychotic drugs, such as chlorpromazine or risperidone or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73, low-quality evidence). When WDD was compared with placebo, no difference was seen between the two treatment groups in the long-term state. There was a high risk of performance bias within the trials but overall, risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias was low or unclear. The quality of the evidence was low.
We included 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 799 participants in this review. We found three new RCTs (228 participants), bringing the total to 12 studies. None of the studies reported the adverse outcome of root resorption (lost from the root of a tooth owing to cementoclastic or osteoclastic activity in conditions such as trauma of occlusion or neoplasms). There is insufficient evidence from these studies to determine whether there is a difference in rate of alignment between multistrand stainless steel and superelastic NiTi arch wires (mean difference (MD) -7.5 mm per month, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.27 to 11.27; 1 study). There were five studies in this group and it was appropriate to undertake a meta-analysis of two of them. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference between the two types of wires in terms of the number of people who had to have their teeth removed from their teeth. There were no differences in the amount of time taken for the teeth to return to their original position. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. We judged three studies to be at high risk of bias, and three to be of low risk.
This review includes just one cluster-randomised study of 306 older people with dementia and an average age of 86 years, conducted across 16 nursing homes in France. The study did not measure any of our primary or secondary outcomes but did measure behavioural change using three measurement scales: the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Observation Scale (OS). The study was published in 1994 as well as published in the journal Neurology (Cummings J.L. 1994). The evidence is current to January 2015. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of dementia in nursing homes. The quality of the evidence for behavioural change was very low. We judged the quality of evidence to be very low because of the small number of participants in the study and the small size of the study. There is a need for larger, well-designed, and well-conducted, randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness of behavioural therapy in the management of dementia.
We included 13 trials with 1316 participants. Participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both, and were residents in a nursing home or were hospitalised. Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods. Nine trials had skin care products, skin care procedures, outcome tools, and measurement tools. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high due to heterogeneity in participant population, and the data were not suitable for meta-analysis due to the small number of trials and small numbers of participants. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence that any of the interventions were effective in reducing incontinence, or in reducing the number of people who had to be admitted to hospital. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. We judged the quality of evidence to be low because of the small size of the included trials, and because of differences in the methods used in the studies.
We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. The antiviral drugs in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacycloviral. The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. We found no evidence that antiviral treatment was superior to placebo or other antiviral treatments for the prevention of herpesvirus infection in people with HIV/AIDS. Antiviral treatment did not appear to be associated with an increased risk of death or serious side effects. However, antiviral therapy was associated with a higher risk of side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of people who developed a serious side effect in the antiviral group compared to the control group. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
This review examined four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 2250 people randomised to either insulin detemir or glargine (a recombinant human insulin analog) in the evening. Insulin was given once-daily with the option of an additional dose in the morning in three studies and initiated twice-daily in the other three studies. Glargine was given twice daily in three of the four studies and once daily in the fourth study. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated studies was high. The evidence is current to January 2015.
In this review, six trials were included. Six trials assessed the effects of SNS for the treatment of faecal incontinence in 53 participants with severe FI. In the parallel trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of diarrhoea than in the control group. SNS also reduced the number of episodes of constipation in the treatment group compared to control groups. In one trial, SNS was associated with a reduction in the frequency and severity of the episodes of bowel problems, but there was no difference between the two groups in terms of length of stay in hospital. There were no differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Two randomised controlled trials (n = 190 participants) were included in the review and both presented data on first time failure at the tooth level. Pooling of the data showed a statistically significant difference in favour of molar bands, with a hazard ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80 to 4.41) (risk of event for molar tubes = 57%; risk of event 25%). One trial showed a significant difference between the two groups (risk ratio 2.30; 95% CI 1.56 to 3.72). No statistically significant heterogeneity was shown in the two studies. Data on the patient level were also available and showed statistically different results. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We identified 66 articles (published between 1988 and 2012) that were eligible according to the inclusion criteria. We collected the data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer who were staged with EUS. For primary tumor (T) stage, results were stratified according to depth of invasion of the gastric wall. We found that EUS is effective in detecting tumour invasion in patients with primary tumour stage, but the quality of the included studies was good: in particular, only five studies presented a high risk of index test interpretation bias and two studies presented high risk selection bias. The meta-analysis of the results of independent studies (usually drawn from the published literature) and synthesizing summaries and conclusions which may be used to plan new studies, plan new trials, and plan new treatments, found that the use of EUS in the treatment of primary tumours was associated with an increased risk of side effects. However, the evidence is current to May 2013. The evidence is up to date to May 2014.
We found six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 492 participants undergoing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 239) versus overnight stay laparoscopy for symptomatic gallstones. The number of participants in each trial ranged from 28 to 150. The mean or median age in the trials varied between 40 and 47 years. The proportion of women in the trial ranged between 74% and 84%. With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported on the number of women with gallstones and only one study reported on adverse events. The overall quality of the evidence was very low. The evidence is current to January 2016. The quality of evidence was low to very low for most of the primary outcomes. We found no evidence of a difference between the two types of surgery in terms of length of hospital stay, time to return to work, cost-effectiveness of the surgery, or the risk of recurrence of gallstones after surgery. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference in the number or length of time women had to stay in hospital for the operation, or whether there were any differences in the length of the operation. There were no differences between the types of women who were discharged from the hospital and those who were not discharged from hospital. We did not find any evidence that there was any difference in length of stay between women who had surgery and women who did not have surgery. However, there was some evidence that women who underwent surgery were less likely to have gallstones when they returned to work after surgery than those who had not had surgery, and there was no difference between those who received surgery and did not receive surgery. We were not able to combine the results of the six included in this review because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of women included in the studies.
We included eight studies, involving 2488 participants, two more studies and 415 more participants than the previous version of this review. Studies were of generally good methodological quality; we judged only one study at high risk of bias, due to small size. We found four studies (1272 participants). At both 8 and 12 weeks, about 10% more participants reported themselves much or very much improved with high-concentration capsaicin than with 'active' placebo; the point estimates of numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) were 8.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.2 to 9.8) for most outcomes, resulting in most outcomes being based on less than complete data. Two studies used a placebo (dummy) to help maintain blinding, and six studies used 0.04% topical capsicin as an 'active'. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who experienced side effects. We did not find any evidence of an effect of high concentration on the severity of postherpetic neuralgia (pain that occurs after the disappearance of herpes zoster infection lesions). We did find no evidence that high concentration of capsicillin was associated with a difference in the number or severity of other side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, or dizziness. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low.
We included three randomised controlled trials involving 6343 participants in this review. We found that surgery increased the five-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke in participants with less than 30% stenosis (N = 1746, risk ratio (RR ratio) 2.2) and the risk of stroke in 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up), after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials using the primary electronic data files, and redefined outcome events where necessary, to achieve comparability. On re-analysis, there were no significant differences between the trials in the risks of any of the main outcomes in either of the treatment groups, or in the effects of surgery. There was no significant difference between the studies in the number of patients who had a stroke in the five years after surgery. The risk of having a stroke after surgery was similar in both groups of participants. There were no differences between studies in terms of side effects, but there were differences in the proportion of people who had an adverse event. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants included in the studies and the small numbers of participants in each study.
We found only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that met the inclusion criteria. The participants underwent enterostomy placement in the frame of an operation for: rectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis (7/60), and other (2/60). The results were inconclusive for the incidence of parastomal herniation (risk ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 4.48; low-quality evidence), development of ileus or stenosis, or skin irritation (RR 0.21 to 2.13, 95-CI 0.19 to 20.9; low quality evidence), and development of skin irritation. The results of this review are based on only one RCT that met our inclusion criteria for this review. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of the lateral pararectal approach over the transrectal approach for the treatment of people with rectal cancers and other types of colitis.
This review included 24 relevant studies, with 2126 participants. We found no significant differences in the primary outcomes of relapse, hospitalisation and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. There were, however, significant differences favouring other psychological or psychosocial treatment over supportive therapy, clinical improvement in mental state (3 RCTs, 194, RR 1.27 CI 1.04 to 1.54, very low quality of evidence), and other psychological treatments over standard care (4 studies, 306 participants). There was no significant difference in the number of people who had a relapse or hospitalisation between the two treatment groups. The quality of the evidence was very low.
This review included 11 studies with a total of 949 participants with mostly moderate or severe pain. Eight studies were double-blind, two single-blind and one open-label, and one both. None had a placebo only control; eight studies compared different NSAIDs, three an NSAID with opioid or opioid combination, and two both. Most studies were conducted in the USA. None of the studies compared NSAIDs with other painkillers or opioids, and only one compared NSAIDS with a placebo. There was no difference in the number of participants who completed treatment, but fewer completed treatment or had results of treatment. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
This review included two randomised controlled trials involving 287 participants. One study (with an overall unclear to high risk of bias) involved 253 participants and the quality of the evidence for most outcomes was very low. This study reported that tinzaparin resulted in more rapid resolution of pain, as measured with a numerical pain scale, at day two and day three (P < 0.01, analysis of variance) and additionally at day 4 (P = 0.05). This study also reported that pain severity at day three was lower in the tin zaparin group than in the placebo group, and at day four the pain severity was also lower. However, there was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who experienced side effects. There was no clear difference in side effects between the groups. There were no serious side effects reported in either study. The quality of evidence was low.
We found 36 randomised controlled trials comparing antiplatelets with anticoagulants across 36 observational studies (1285 patients). There were no significant differences in the odds of death or disability, or the occurrence of ischaemic stroke, between the groups. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhages (5/627; 0.8%) and major extracranial bleeding (7/425; 1.6%) occurred only in the antiplatelet group (26 studies, 463 patients). However, for both these outcomes, the estimates were imprecise and indicated no significant difference between the two treatment groups (34 studies, 1262 patients). We did not find any completed randomised trials.
We found 26 randomised controlled trials (2066 patients) that compared silver nitrate with non-silver nitrate dressings (in a variety of formulations - including silver sulphadiazine (SSD) cream) and silver dressings. The evidence is current to January 2016. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands, and included a total of 2066 patients. The results of the trials varied widely in terms of the type of wound, type of dressings used, and type of treatment, so we were unable to combine the results of all the trials. We grouped results according to wound type, and silver preparation. One trial showed fewer infections when compared with silver nitrates compared with other dressings, but there was no clear difference in the number of people who died. There was no significant difference between the two dressings in the proportion of patients who had to be treated with antibiotics. There were no clear differences in the amount of time patients spent in hospital, the length of hospital stay, or the time they spent in the intensive care unit (ICU). There was not enough information to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of silver nitrated dressings for treating wounds. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of patients included in the studies.
We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure, or side effects. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We did not find any evidence of a difference in the number of people who died or developed serious side effects between the two treatment regimens. However, we did find no evidence of differences in the proportion of patients who developed a serious side effect between the treatment groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
We included 29 studies (12 were controlled studies and 12 were randomised controlled trials) investigating policies targeting 11 drug classes for restriction. Participants were most often senior citizens or low income adult populations, or both, in publically subsidized or administered pharmaceutical benefit plans. Impact of policies varied by drug class and whether restriction was implemented or relaxed. When policies targeted gastric-acid suppressant and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug classes, decrease drug use and substantial savings occurred immediately and for up to two years afterwards, with no increase in the use of other health services (6 studies). Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs (drugs that control agitated psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect) increased treatment discontinuity and cost savings, but did not reduce overall drug expenditures (2 studies). Relaxing restriction was not associated with an increase in drug use or cost savings (1 study). We found no evidence of a difference in the number of people who dropped out of the study due to adverse effects of the policies. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The quality of evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
Nineteen studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review with data available for a total of 4232 participants. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies and it was not deemed appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis. We summarised data by categorising similar interventions into comparison groups. Four studies compared any form of one-to-one OHA versus no OHA. Two studies reported the outcomes and outcome measures. The included studies reported a wide variety of interventions. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of OHA in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in people with COPD. The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included in the included studies.
Five small randomised controlled trials were included in this review. Two trials (30 and 49 participants) compared oral steroids with placebo or no treatment; one trial (28 participants) of oral or intra-articular steroids; and one trial of oral steroids (40 participants) with no treatment. The evidence is current to January 2015. The review found that oral steroids may be effective in reducing the number of people who need to be treated with corticosteroids. However, there was no clear difference between oral steroids and placebo in terms of side effects. There was not enough evidence to determine whether oral steroids were more effective than placebo in reducing side effects in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There were no clear differences between the two groups in the amount of time taken to return to normal activities of daily living. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of participants in the trials and the small size of the included trials.
Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 50 participants were included in the review. All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results of results. All three trials compared rTMS with sham TMS. None of the trials provided detailed data on the ALS outcome. The three trials did not report on any adverse effects of the treatment. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of rTMs for the treatment of ALS.
We included 10 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1049 participants of moderate to high risk of bias. All studies involved different comparison groups, none had a placebo (dummy) treatment, and in which the treatment group received prednisone plus or without a placebo. In 1 trial, plasma exchange plasma exchange was compared with a placebo group at 1 month (0.3 mg/kg: RR 18.78, 95% CI 18.3 to 18.9). In one trial, the plasma exchange group had significantly better disease control at one month than the placebo group. In the other trial, there was no difference between the two treatment groups in the number of people who had a serious adverse events. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of plasma exchange for the treatment of Crohn's disease. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether plasma exchange is effective in preventing Crohn’s disease. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and small numbers of participants.
This review included 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, in which herbal medicine was also combined with conventional therapy and compared to conventional therapy alone. Compared with placebo, a Standard Chinese herbal formula (STW 5 and STW 5-II), Tibetan herbal medicine Padma Lax, traditional Chinese formula Tongxie Yaofang, and Ayurvedic preparation showed significantly improvement of global symptoms compared with placebo or conventional pharmacologic therapy, but the quality of remaining trials was generally low.
We found 22 randomised controlled trials that included a total of 12,400 women. The trials were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs included levonorgestrel (LNG) 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in dose (4 trials), and hormones other than LNG (7 trials). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, discontinuation, side effects, and acceptability. The pooled Pearl Index (Pearl Index) for the LNG dose was 5.4 per 100 women-years (95% CI 4.4 to 7.4). The drug was reasonably efficacious and safe. Pericoital use of LNG and other hormonal drugs on a regular basis to prevent pregnancy was reasonably effective and safe, and there were no serious side effects reported in any of the included trials. However, there was no clear difference in the number of women who dropped out of the trials due to side effects.
This review included 15 studies with a total of 561 randomised patients. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years). The distribution of males and female patients was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies. Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias; one study at low risk; and six studies at unclear risk. The evidence is current to January 2015. The review found that there was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of patients who died from any cause between the two groups. There was no evidence of any difference between the groups in terms of length of hospital stay. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. There were no clear differences between the studies in the proportion of people who died, number of hospital admissions, hospital stay, length of stay, hospital admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital discharge from ICU, or hospital stay in ICU. However, there was some evidence that there were fewer hospital admissions to ICU and ICU discharge in the ICU for patients who had been treated for cancer. There is no evidence to suggest that there is a difference between groups in the amount of time patients spent in intensive care or ICU or in hospital discharge. The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results of this review.
We included 50 studies (45,285 participants): 47 studies compared statins with placebo or no treatment and three studies compared two different statins in adults with CKD who were not yet on dialysis. We were able to meta-analyse 38 studies (37,274 participants). The risk of bias in the included studies was high. The studies were conducted according to published protocols, outcomes were adjudicated by a committee, specified outcomes were reported, and analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat methods. Seven studies comparing statin with placebo (an indication that no treatment was done or administered) and one study comparing placebo with no treatment (a dummy treatment) showed that statins had lower risk of side effects than placebo. However, there was no clear difference between statins and placebo in the number of people who had a serious adverse event (e.g. heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, or death). There were no clear differences between statin and placebo groups in the proportion of people with serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
We included nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 379 participants. Participants had cerebral palsy (CP) in five of the studies and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in the other four. Participants across the trials were followed up for at least six months. We found no evidence of a difference between CP and OI in the number of people who developed osteoporosis in the first year of life. We did not find any evidence of an effect of CP or OI on other outcomes, such as quality of life, disability, disability-related disability, or death. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Seven trials involving a total of 1697 participants were found and six were included in the quantitative analyses. No data were available from the seventh trial. We judged five trials to be at high risk of bias due to selective outcome measures of efficacy and tolerability, and four trials involving 1034 patients were included. We found no data from the sixth trial to be of high quality. Three trials involving 1243 patients were excluded from the analyses due to lack of data. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review authors found that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic lung disease. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and small numbers of participants.
We included seven randomised controlled trials, involving 735 participants, in this review. We analysed the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. We found that RIC may reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a stroke. However, we did not find any clear evidence of a difference between RIC and placebo in terms of the number of people who died or were admitted to hospital. We also found no clear evidence to support RIC in preventing or treating other types of stroke. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the included studies and the way in which the studies were carried out. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be low for risk of bias (attrition bias) in five studies and low in two studies; high for blinding in three studies and unclear in four studies; low for incomplete outcome data in one study; unclear for allocation over various time periods in six studies; and unclear for concealment of study results in one trial.
We included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 204 preterm infants. Low-quality evidence showed that protein supplementation of human milk increased in-hospital growth in weight (MD 3.82 g/kg/day, 95% CI 2.94 to 4.7; five RCTs, 101 infants; I² = 73%), length (MD 0.12 cm/wk, 95%, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.17; four RCTS, 68 infants); and head circumference (MD -0.06 mm/wk) between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups. There was no evidence of a clear difference in the rate of growth of skin fold thickness between infants receiving protein supplementation and those infants receiving no protein supplementation. There were no clear differences between the groups in terms of the number of infants who had to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or who were discharged from the NICU. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.
This review includes 45 studies: 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies. Almost all the included studies (44/45) compared the effectiveness of PEM to no intervention. Based on seven RCT and 54 outcomes, the median absolute risk difference in categorical practice outcomes was 0.13 when PEMs were compared to no interventions (range from -0.16 to +0.11). Based on three RCTS and eight outcomes, there was a median improvement in standardised mean difference for continuous practice outcomes for continuous profession practice outcomes (0.02) and a mean improvement in the number of people who were satisfied with the quality of the PEM delivered on CD-ROM compared to those who received the same document delivered on paper-based PEM. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of quality of life. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2015.
A total of 5271 references were screened and of these 23 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Most were conducted in the USA and in health-care clinics (e.g. free sexual health services). They were heterogeneous in duration, contact time, provider, behavioural aims and outcome aims and outcomes. A variety of STI were addressed including HIV and chlamydia. The majority of interventions (investigations by nurses design) provided information about STI and taught safer sex skills, occasionally supplemented with provision with provision of resources. None of the trials explicitly mentioned HPV or cervical cancer prevention. Statistically significant effects were seen for behavioural effects for behavioural interventions, but there was no clear evidence of a difference between the interventions in terms of the number of people who stopped having sex or stopped using condoms. There was no evidence of any difference between interventions in the proportion of women who dropped out of the studies due to side effects. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included twenty studies with a total of 2337 participants in this review. Nineteen studies compared brief psychoeducation with routine care or conventional delivery of information of information. One study compared brief psychosocial education with cognitive behavior therapy (a type of psychotherapy that involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive). The other studies compared short-term psychoeducation versus routine care. We found that participants receiving brief psychological education were less likely to be non-compliant with medication than those receiving routine care in the short term (n = 448, 3 RCTs, RR 0.63 CI 0.41 to 0.96, moderate quality evidence) and medium-quality evidence in the long term. Compliance with medication was similar between the two groups with follow-up. We did not find any difference in the number of people who stopped taking their medication because of side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to low.
We included 11 studies comprising 9839 participants in our quantitative analysis. Most studies included people with moderate to severe COPD, without recent exacerbations, and accounted for 37% of participants. All but one study were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, thus we rated them as having a high risk of 'other bias'. Five studies recruited GOLD Category B participants, one study recruited Category D participants, two studies recruited Category A/B participants, and three studies recruited participants regardless of category. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks (Any period between 6 and 52 weeks). The average follow-up time in the studies ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 years. The average duration of follow-ups ranged from 3.2 to 4.2 years. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in the number of people who experienced an exacerbation of COPD. We did not find any evidence of differences between the groups in any of the quality of life outcomes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016. The studies included in this review were small and of low quality. We judged the overall quality of evidence from the included studies to be low or very low, which means that we are very uncertain about the results.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 91 children aged between 6 months and 4 years. All studies were conducted in emergency departments in the USA (two studies) and Spain (one study). Heliox was administered as a mixture of 70% heliox and 30% oxygen for 20 minutes. One study of 15 children with mild croup compared heliox with 30% humidified oxygen. There may be no difference in croup score in two studies and high risk of bias in one study due to an open-label design. We found no new trials for this update.
Eight studies set in primary, secondary and tertiary care (four studies) and emergency settings (three studies) were included in the review. Overall, the risk of bias of studies was moderate with high risk of selection and verification bias the predominant flaws. Reporting of index and reference tests was poor (below the standard of the community). The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident, emergency and primary care settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%. There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies. Three red flag tests were potentially useful with meaningful positive likelihood ratios. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of index or reference tests in primary and secondary care settings for the diagnosis of vertebrae fractures in adults.
Two randomised controlled trials were identified. One trial compared the outcomes of surgical urethral dilatation and optical urethrotomy in 210 adult men with urinary stricture disease. No significant difference was found in the proportion of men being stricture free at three years or in the median time to recurrence after two years of surgery. The second trial, involving 50 men with traumatic stricture of the posterior urethra following pelvic fracture injury, found no significant difference between the two groups in the number of men requiring further surgery or the length of time to return to normal urinary function. Both trials were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma were included in the included trials. The four paediatric trials contributed to the meta-analyses (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of patients with persistent asthma dying from any cause between the two treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the number of patients who experienced a serious adverse event (e.g. wheezing) between the groups. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 17 studies involving 1639 people with CKD. Three studies enrolled 341 people treated with dialysis, four studies enrolled 168 kidney transplant recipients, and 10 studies enrolled 1130 people. Eleven studies (900 people) evaluated a carbohydrate-restricted low-iron, polyphenol enriched diet, two studies (181 people) assessed dietary counselling with or without lifestyle advice and six evaluated dietary patterns (739 people), including one study (191 people). We found that people who followed dietary advice had a lower risk of developing CKD in the CKD stages 1 to 5 compared to people who did not. However, we did not find a difference between the two groups in the number of people who developed CKD at the end of follow-up. We also found no difference in the risk of death between the groups. The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be low or very low.
Only one study (156 children aged between seven weeks and 24 months with signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. Participants were randomised into three groups: nebulised salbutamol, saline and mist in a tent. The results showed a significant decrease in respiratory distress symptom (RDS) score in the saline group but no significant reduction in the RDS in the mist group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of children who were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and the number who were discharged from the ICU. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants and the small size of the study.
We found four studies (1154 participants, age range 50 to 90 years). All participants had a diagnosis of probable or possible Alzheimer's disease according to standard criteria and most participants were established on a cholinesterase inhibitor. The primary outcome in all studies was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) from baseline. All studies provided change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). There was no significant benefit from statins in MMSE when we pooled the data (mean difference -0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.32 to 0.52, P value = 0.06). Three studies reported treatment-related adverse effects. When we pooled data from three studies, there was no statistically significant benefit in the MMSE from statin treatment compared to placebo. We found no evidence that statins are effective in reducing the risk of cognitive decline in people with AD. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
Four studies involving 149 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. Two studies assessed the effect of night splinting in a total of 26 children and adults with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. One study assessed the efficacy of prednisone treatment in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between wearing a night splinter and not wearing one. There was no difference in some strength and function parameters compared with placebo (placebo) in the two studies. A daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day was found to be effective in improving the strength, function and quality of life of the participants in one study, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of days they were able to work. The other two studies did not report on the effects of wearing night splints compared with not wearing them. The quality of the evidence was low or very low.
This review included 25 randomised controlled trials (5218 women) comparing upright and ambulant positions versus recumbent positions and bed care, the first stage of labour (one hour and 22 minutes shorter for women who were upright as opposed to recumbents) and the second stage (two hours and one hour shorter) of labour for women randomised to upright positions (average MD -1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.22 to -0.51; 15 studies, 2503 women); random-effects, T2 = 2.39, Chi2 = 203.55, df = 14, (P < 0.00001), I2 = 93%). For comparison 1: Upright positions versus reclining positions and ambulants, the average duration of labour was approximately one hour and two minutes shorter and the duration of bed care was about one hour longer for women in the upright positions compared to those in the reclined positions. For comparison 2: Women in the ambulant position compared to the reclining position were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and more likely to have a caesarean section (i.e. an emergency department). For comparison 3: Women who were lying down compared to lying down did not differ in the length of hospital stay or the number of women admitted to intensive care units. For comparisons 4: Women lying down versus lying down, there was no difference in hospital stay, bed time, length of time in the ICU or length of stay in the emergency department. The review authors concluded that there was not enough evidence to support the use of upright positions during labour.
This review was complicated by a lack of generally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of TOS and had to rely exclusively on the diagnosis by the investigators in the studies. We found three randomized controlled trials comparing natural progression with an active intervention, but only two of them had a follow-up of six months or more, which was the minimum required for eligibility and observed for predefined evidence of favorable and unfavorable effects of the intervention. The first trial compared natural progression versus an active treatment group, and the second trial compared the two groups. The third trial compared two groups of people with TOS who had been treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and those who had not been given NSAIDs. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the number of people who developed TOS, the length of hospital stay, or the time to return to work. There were no differences between the two treatment groups in any of the outcomes measured in the second and third trials. We could not combine the results of the three trials because of the small number of participants in the first trial and the low quality of the evidence. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Twenty-one randomised controlled trials involving 884 people were included in this review. A hand brace was found to be more effective than ultrasound treatment in improving symptoms and function after four weeks. However, ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not beneficial. In an analysis of pooled data from two trials (63 participants) ultrasound treatment showed significant symptom improvement after seven weeks of ultrasound (WMD -0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0 to -1.28). However, one trial showed no significant benefit of ultrasound treatment after two weeks. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ultrasound treatment is beneficial or not.
We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled a total of 708 participants with CRVO-ME. SCORE compared triamcinolone acetonide intravitreal injections with observation with sham injections (n = 165) and GENEVA compared dexamethasone implant with observation and sham injections. We found no difference in the number of participants who lost to follow-up between the groups. We also found no differences between the two groups in the proportion of people who were able to return to work within three months of the end of the study. We did not find any differences in the percentage of participants with adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low due to incomplete data in SCORE and selective outcome reporting in GENEVA.
Six randomised trials involving a total of 394 patients were included. Five of the six trials demonstrated a significant efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids in improving nasal obstruction symptoms and in reducing adenoid size. The first eight-week cross-over study showed that treatment with beclomethasone (336 mcg/day) yielded a greater improvement in mean symptom scores than placebo (-18.5 versus -8.5, P < 0.05) and a larger reduction in mean adenoids/choana ratio between week 0 and week 2, whereas none of the patients treated with placebo had such improvement (P = 0.0006). The second four-week trial showed that the Nasal Obstruction Index (NIA) decreased by at least 50% from baseline in 38% of participants treated with mometasone (400 mg/day). The third parallel-group trials showed that 77.7% of the participants in the placebo group had an improvement in the NIA between week 4 and week 6, and none of those in the treatment group had such an improvement between week 7 and week 8. The fourth and fifth parallel-groups showed that there was no difference between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who had a reduction in the size of their nasal obstruction between week 2 and week 7, but there was a difference in the proportion of patients with a reduction between week 3 and week 4. The sixth trial showed no differences between the treatment groups for any of the outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any particular treatment for the treatment of nasal obstruction.
We found only one small randomised controlled trial (involving 24 women) that compared a control group who received antihypertensive therapy, anticonvulsant therapy, plasma expanders, corticosteroids and dypyridamole with an intervention group that received epidural block instead of the anthypertensives, as well as other interventions. This study was a single-centre randomised trial conducted in Mexico and involved 24 women. The results of this study were inconclusive. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of women who had seizures, number of days in hospital, length of hospital stay, time to return to work, or number of hospital admissions. There were no differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The study did not report on adverse effects of the intervention. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Sixteen trials met our inclusion criteria. Fifteen trials (one of which was an abstract) provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention) for a median of 28 days. All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias. The evidence is current to August 2016. Glucocortics were administered orally or parenterally for a mean of 28 weeks. The trials were conducted in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and in a range of countries. The results of this review are based on 16 trials with a total of 927 participants. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main limitations of the included trials were the small numbers of participants and the small number of participants in each trial. There was not enough evidence to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the benefits and harms of this treatment.
We included four randomised controlled trials involving 245 participants in the review. All four studies were at a low risk of bias in the areas of: performance (participants not blinded to allocation, and attrition), and attrition (incomplete outcome data due to withdrawal). The studies were generally small, and intervention approaches included the contextual approach of driving simulation and underlying skill development approach, including the retraining of speed of visual processing and visual motor skills, with a high/unclear risk for the majority of domains. We found no evidence to suggest that any of the interventions were effective in improving motor skills in people with motor neurone disease. The quality of the evidence was low or very low due to the small number of studies, and the small sample sizes of the included studies. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants contributed to the meta-analysis. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer- duration treatment. Five studies administered corticosteroids to participants aged 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. The average age of study participants was 65 years, and the average duration of treatment ranged from three days to 10 days. There was no difference in the number of deaths or serious adverse events between the two groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of quality of life. The quality of the evidence was limited by the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included in the studies. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We included one randomised controlled trial (13 participants) and identified three ongoing trials that assess RBC transfusion strategies in people with MDS. The one included study randomised participants to a restrictive [haemoglobin (Hb) trigger < 72 g/L, 8 participants] or liberal [Hb trigger < 96 g/l, 5 participants] policy. The quality of the evidence was very low across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. There was insufficient evidence to determine a difference in all-cause mortality (1 RCT; 13 participants); RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.32; very low quality evidence). There were insufficient data to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups in the number of people who died or were admitted to hospital. There were no differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this review. The first study was based on the television game show "Family Feud" and focused on infection control. The second study was a control group that did not assess any patient or process of care outcomes (a measure of the mortality and morbidity rates among patients who receive CRITICAL CARE and INTENSIVE CARE as determined from the date of hospital discharge or release). Both studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR). The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The results of the studies did not show any difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients who died or had a serious adverse event. However, the study did show that the group that was randomized to the game had statistically higher scores on the knowledge test (knowledge test) than the control group. In the second study, the participants were randomly assigned to receive either the game or a placebo (a control group). The participants in the game group had a significantly higher knowledge test score than those in the placebo group. The study did not report on any of the other outcomes that were measured in the study, such as quality of life, patient satisfaction, quality of care, or quality of hospital stay. There were no differences between the groups in any of these outcomes. There was not enough evidence to determine whether the game was effective in improving patient satisfaction or patient satisfaction with the care. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a game to improve patient satisfaction.
Eight randomised controlled trials involving 475 people with bipolar disorder were included in this review. Two of the studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or unipolar disorder. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of lithium in terms of the number of people who were admitted to hospital and when all kinds of relapses were considered (both depressive and manic). There were no other statistically significant differences between lithium and antidepressant treatment. The results did not exclude the point of no effect, when the random-effects model was used.
We found two randomised controlled trials with 130 patients (67 and 63 patients randomised to treatment with amifostine versus placebo) that compared the effects of the drug on the incidence of xerostomia, the reduction of blood pressure, and the reduction in salivary uptake of technetium-99m isotopes in the neck. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the number of patients who had a stroke and the number who had an increase in the risk of stroke. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the occurrence of any of the following outcomes: the rate of stroke, number of strokes, and number of stroke survivors. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with a stroke, stroke survivors, or stroke-free survival between the groups. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small numbers of patients included in the studies and the small number of participants in the included studies.
We included three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years with Down syndrome. Two studies compared parent-mediated interventions versus TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil); the third compared a parent- mediated plus clinician intervention versus a clinician-mediated intervention alone. Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months. One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home-based sessions over the course of 12 weeks; the other two studies provided nine sessions and nine individualised sessions over six months; the third study provided two sessions and one individualised session over a six-month period. All three studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The evidence is current to May 2016. The evidence for the effects of parent-medication versus TAUs is current up to date to May 2015. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of children who died from any cause between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. We judged the quality of evidence to be low because of the small number of included studies and the small numbers of children included in the studies.
We included two trials from 1987 and 2004 with a total of 148 participants who have had heart valve surgery. Both trials had a high risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence at 3 to 6 months follow-up to judge the effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to no exercise on mortality (RR 4.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 3.62); participants = 148; studies = 2; quality of evidence: very low). Included trials did not report on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the secondary outcomes of New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction and cost. We did find that, compared with no exercise, there was no difference between exercise and no exercise in the number of people who died or experienced serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence was very low.
Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1130 participants were included in this review. Two studies evaluated meditation, the others evaluated multi-disciplinary palliative care interventions that involved a chaplain or spiritual counsellor as a member of the intervention team (two or more people working together). The studies evaluating meditation found no overall significant difference between those receiving meditation or usual care on quality of life or well-being. However, when meditation was combined with massage in the medium term it buffered against a reduction in quality of care, but there was no significant difference in the effect of meditation on health, physical, mental, emotional, social, or spiritual health. There was no evidence of a difference between meditation and usual care in terms of the number of people who experienced side effects. There were no significant differences between those who received meditation and those who did not receive meditation. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate for all outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included six studies with a total of 137 participants. We found two studies with 45 participants examining the effect of tDCS compared to control (sham tDCS) on our primary outcome measure, global UPDRS score (MD -7.10 %, 95% confidence interval (CI -19.18 to 4.97; P = 0.25, I² = 21%, random-effect model). However, there was very low quality evidence for no effect of the tDCS on change in global U PDRS score, impairment, as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). There was evidence for a small effect on the number of participants who were able to walk independently. There was no evidence of a difference in quality of life between tDCS and sham tDCS. The quality of the evidence is very low.
We included four studies (N = 154) in this update. Overall we included 12 studies (n = 461), all of which we judged to be at high or unclear risk of bias, downgraded due to limitations, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or a combination of these. For this update, we excluded studies that did not follow up patients for more than 48 hours. Overall, the quality of evidence was low to very low. Two small studies compared LASB to placebo/sham (32 participants). They did not demonstrate significant short-term benefit for pain intensity (moderate quality evidence). One small study (36 participants) compared thoracic sympathetic block with corticosteroid and local anaesthetic versus injection of the same agents (very low quality evidence) and found no difference in pain intensity between the two groups. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the number of patients who needed to be re-admitted to hospital. The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate for the effect of LASBs compared to placebo or sham (low quality evidence), and very low for the effects of local anaesthesia versus injection. The evidence is current to May 2016.
Fourteen randomised controlled trials, including 2488 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most were small, and most were at high or unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. A combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may have little or no effect on rate of incomplete recovery in people with Bell's palsy compared to a single antiviral treatment alone. Incomplete recovery may be better in people who are taking antiviral drugs, but there is no clear difference between the two treatments in terms of the number of people who have to be discharged from hospital. There is not enough evidence to determine whether antiviral treatments are effective in preventing incomplete recovery.
Two studies, including 97 women, met our inclusion criteria: one assessed LHRH agonist (leuprorelin) use in relapsed EOC in comparison with a chemotherapeutic agent (treosulfan) (Du Bois 2002); the other examined a placebo (decapeptyl) (Currie 1994). Since both studies had different control groups, a meta-analysis was not possible. There may be little or no difference between treatment with leuporelin or treosulfans in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in women with EOC, but there may be a difference in the number of women who had to be treated with a chemotherapy drug (e.g. dexamethasone) compared to those who received placebo (a dummy treatment). There may also be a small difference in survival between the two groups in terms of the proportion of women treated with chemotherapy. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of EOC.
We found 17 randomised controlled studies that included term and near-term infants with hypoxia. Ten trials compared iNO versus control (placebo) or standard care without iNO in infants with moderate or severe severity of illness scores (Ninos 1996; Roberts 1996; Wessel 1996; Davidson 1997; Ninos 1997; Mercier 1998; Christou 2000; Clark 2000; INNOVO 2007; Liu 2008). One trial compared the use of iNO with placebo (a dummy medication) or no treatment. We found no evidence that iNO was more effective than placebo in improving the quality of life of infants with severe or moderate-to-severe illness scores. We did not find any evidence of benefit or harm from iNO compared with placebo. We judged the overall quality of the evidence to be low or very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of infants included in the included studies.
The evidence is current to January 2015. We included seven preventive studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1361 people) in this updated review. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was rather low. There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training in preventing low-back pain, and conflicting evidence whether they are effective in preventing other preventive interventions to other preventive intervention. It is still unclear if lumbary supports are more effective or less effective than other interventions for the treatment of low back pain.
We included 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations. Most studies enrolled participants from the age of 18, including patients in intensive care units, oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition. The total number of participants enrolled was unclear, as some studies did not provide this information. Overall, catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), with an ARR of 2% (95% CI 3% to 1%), RR of 0.62 (0.52 to 0.74) and NNTB of 50 (high-quality evidence). There were low or unclear risks of bias in the included studies, except for blinding, which was impossible in most studies due to the catheter that were being assessed having different appearances. There was no significant difference between groups in the number of people who had a catheter infection. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
This review included 15 studies, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The intervention took place in recognised slums or poor urban or periurban areas. The participants included 9261 infants and children and 3664 pregnant women. All the studies identified were nutrient supplementation and educational interventions. There were no dietary intervention studies. The intervention locations were mainly Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The interventions included zinc supplementation in pregnant women (three studies), micronutrients or macronutrient supplementation (two studies), and educational intervention (one study). The studies were mainly conducted in Bangladesh and India. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review authors found no evidence to support or refute the use of nutrient supplementation or educational interventions to improve the health of infants, children, and pregnant women in developing countries. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies.
Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1023 participants were included in this review. Pooled data across five RCTs (418 participants) showed no statistically significant difference between foam dressings and hydrocolloid dressings in the proportion of ulcers healed at 12 to 16 weeks (risk ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.22). No statistically significant between-group differences in healing outcomes were detected when foam dressing was compared with: paraffin gauze; hydrocapillary dressing; knitted viscose dressing; and protease modulating matrix (one RCT). There was no significant difference in the number of participants experiencing adverse events when hydrocellular foam dressers were compared with polyurethane dressings. There was a lack of evidence to support the use of a foam dressing for the treatment of chronic ulcers.
This review included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that included 381 patients with IBD. One study (n = 222) compared celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. The other study (N = 159) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) (a synthetic, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with antipyretic properties) to a placebo (any dummy medication or treatment). There were no studies that assessed the tolerability or safety of the withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors rofecoxib, valdecoxib or lumiracoxib. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the withdrawal of these drugs was due to safety concerns.
We found 22 randomised controlled trials with a total of over 2310 participants. The included studies mostly had small numbers of participants (from 4 to 317) and relatively short follow-up periods (4 to 24 weeks). At baseline, six trials included only people with ulcers that were clinically infected; one trial did not report number of participants; one study included people with both infected and uninfected ulcers; and one trial included both people with and without infected ulcers. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that there was no difference between the two groups in the number of ulcers healed at the end of 24 weeks. There was no clear difference in the rate of ulcer healing between the groups. The quality of the evidence was low, mainly because of the small number of people included in the studies and the short duration of the studies. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate to low.
We included six studies that involved 5193 participants. Analysis showed that zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of pneumonia by 13% and the prevalence by 41% of pneumonia, but had no effect on lower specificity pneumonia case definition (i.e. confirmation by chest examination or chest radiograph). On subgroup analysis, we found that zinc supplements reduced the occurrence of pneumonia defined by specific clinical criteria by 21% and pneumonia prevalence by 21%. However, zinc supplementation did not reduce the number of people who died from any cause. We did not find any new studies for inclusion in this update.
Ten studies including 33,179 participants were included in this review. Eight studies found no significant effect of vitamin A on the incidence of acute or chronic LRTI, or prevalence of symptoms of acute and chronic bronchiolitis. Two studies reported that vitamin A caused an increase in cough and fever in one study; and increase in symptoms of cough and rapid breathing in two other studies. Three studies reported no differences and no protective effect between vitamin A and placebo in the incidence, prevalence, or duration of LRTIs. One study reported no difference in the number of people who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (a type of bronchitis) between the two groups. Vitamin A was not associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse events in any of the studies. The quality of the evidence was low or very low.
Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Concomitant therapy varied from none to any other bronchodilator plus corticosteroid (oral and inhaled). The following outcomes were significantly different when compared to placebo: Forced expiratory volume in one second improved with treatment: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 100 ml; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 40 to 160 ml. Similarly for forced vital capacity (FVC): WMD 210 ml 95%CI 1.2 to 5.1, and WMD -2.2 mm Hg 95% CI 1.0 to 3.0. Two studies reported an improvement in maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max) at rest. At rest, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and arterial carbon dioxide tension at rest (PaCO2) both improved when compared with placebo: WMD 195 ml (95% CI 113 to 278.5 ml). Similarly, at rest, PaCO2 and PaO2 at rest both improved in the two studies that reported this outcome. However, these results are based on a small number of studies. More studies are needed.
We included 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved a total of 439 children. Three studies used placebo and seven used an egg avoidance diet as the control. Each study used a different oral immunotherapy protocol; none used sublingual immunotherapy. The evidence is current to January 2016. The studies were conducted in children aged 1 year to 18 years. The average age of the children in the studies ranged from 4.5 to 6.5 years. We found no evidence of a difference in the number of children who died or developed serious side effects between children who received oral and control immunotherapy and those who did not receive immunotherapy, or who received placebo or egg avoidance diets. We did not find any evidence of an effect of immunotherapy on any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was low for all of the outcomes. We judged the quality of evidence to be very low because of the small number of included studies and the small numbers of children included in the included studies.
We included four randomised controlled trials involving a total of 579 participants. Two studies reported data on long-term mortality between participants who received ILR and those who were managed conventionally at follow-up (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.30; participants = 255; studies = 2; very low quality evidence). No data on short term mortality were available. We found no evidence of a difference in the risk of long term mortality between people receiving ILR versus those who received conventional care. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants included in the studies and the fact that only two of the four included studies had considered death as a primary outcome.
We found four small studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies enrolled 275 patients with 282 hydroceles. Participants were randomised to aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydrocele) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydrocely). All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias (Any deviation of result may be due to the way the study was carried out). The results of the studies suggest that aspiration may be more effective than surgery in reducing the number of patients with haemorrhage. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of length of hospital stay. There were no clear differences between the groups in the proportion of patients who had to have a blood transfusion. There was not enough information to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of aspiration on the risk of bleeding. The quality of the evidence was low or very low because of the small number of studies and small numbers of participants.
We included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared nebulised recombinant recombinant human deoxyribonuclease with placebo in 40 children with airway malacia and a respiratory tract infection. We assessed it to be a RCT with overall low risk of bias. Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion of proportion cough-free at two weeks (odds ratio 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 5.14). However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo group (mean difference (MD 1.83, P = 0.02). The mean change from baseline was also better in the control group (MD 2.00, P= 0.00). There were no significant differences between groups in the number of children who had a cough at the end of the study period (MD 3.14, P < 0.001). There was no difference between the groups for any of the secondary outcomes (MD 4.13, MD 1.00; P = 1.01). The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all of the primary outcomes. There was not enough evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of nebulisation for the treatment of cough in children with asthma.
We included 21 studies with 2658 participants in this review. All studies assessed the effectiveness of some form of psychological therapy. Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); the remainder evaluated behaviour therapies, third-wave CBT, psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy. Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list. We found no studies that included physical therapy. Across the 21 studies, the mean number of sessions ranged from one to 13, over a period of one day. Only one study compared the intervention to enhanced or structured care, and only one study reported on the effect of the intervention on quality of life. We did not find any studies that looked at the effects of psychological therapies on the number of people who dropped out of the study due to side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. The evidence is current to January 2016.
In this updated review, we identified 40 new studies and seven ongoing studies. In total, we included 63 RCTs in the review after examination of published material, but we were only able to synthesize data on regional anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP beyond three months after surgery, enrolling a total of 3027 participants in our inclusive analysis. Evidence synthesis of seven studies suggested the odds of having PPP three to 18 months following an epidural for thoracotomy were 0.52 (95% CI 0.32 to 0.84, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Simlarly, evidence synthesis of 18 studies suggested that epidural anaesthesia was associated with a lower risk of developing PPP after surgery compared to not having a epidural. The evidence is current to July 2016.
Twenty-eight randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1742 participants were included in this review. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. There is a need for more high-quality, well-designed, and well-conducted randomised clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of these drugs.
We included seven trials involving a total of 349 participants, 217 of whom completed the studies. Three trials were cross-over and four were parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, two trials were added for this update (one with 40 participants and one with 67 participants). Analyses of three RCTs showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of participants who died or had a serious adverse event. There were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of people who had an adverse event (e.g. heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or death from any cause). There was no clear difference in the percentage of patients who had a heart attack or died from any causes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 30 studies (18,682 participants in total). Eighteen studies contributed to the main objective of the review. We found substantial differences between studies in cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue, and sample size. All included studies scored at least one 'Risk of bias' item as unclear or high risk of bias. We identified both clinical and statistical heterogeneity and therefore could not pool results, so we present them descriptively. Eighteen of the studies (describing 14,573 survivors) reported the prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. In a subgroup of three studies including children up to 18 years of age, the proportion of children with severe fatigue ranged from 1.6% to 2.2%. We found no difference in the number of children who had severe fatigue at the end of the study period. The quality of the evidence was low to very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of children included in the studies. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 36 randomised controlled trials involving 6914 people. There was variation in the antibiotic use, patient characteristics and risk of RTIs and mortality in the control group. In trials comparing a combination of topical and systemic antibiotic, there was a significant reduction in both RTIs (number of studies = 16, odds ratio (OR 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI 0.20 to 0.38) and total mortality) in the treated group, but there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who died or were admitted to hospital. There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of serious adverse events (e.g. infection, infection-related complications) or in the proportion of patients who had to be treated with antibiotics. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
Five studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Four studies examined nursing home residents and one study examined residents in group dwelling units. Two studies offered consultation in addition and two other studies offered guidance for nursing staff in addition. Three studies included only one or two nursing homes per study. No studies in community settings were included. Overall, methodological quality of studies was low. The studies revealed inconsistent results. One study in the nursing home setting documented an increase of PR use in both groups after eight months, while the other three studies found reduced use of PR in the intervention group after seven and 12 months of follow up respectively. The single study examining residents in groups dwelling units found no change in PR use after six months. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who used PR at the end of the study period. The quality of the evidence was low for all outcomes.
Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review. The trials compared glucocorticoid supplementation during IVF stimulation versus placebo. Two of the studies had data in a form that we could not enter into analysis, so results were available for only 212 women, as the larger study had data. For the outcome of live birth, data from only two trials (310) women, showed no difference in live birth between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of women who had a live birth. There were no significant differences in the proportion of women in the group who had an adverse event (e.g. blood clotting disorder). There was not a significant difference in the percentage of women with a serious adverse event in either group. The overall quality of the evidence was low.
We included eight trials (291 participants, aged between five and 23 years) in this revision of the review. Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment (63 participants) and one trial compared a high-dose (0.5 mg per week) rhGH to a placebo (dummy treatment). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of rhGH for the treatment of endometriosis in people with endometrial cancer. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants.
We included 26 studies with 1,695 participants that reported on three comparisons: complete removal from exposure and reduced exposure compared to continued exposure, and complete removal compared to reduced exposure. In 18 studies, authors compared removal of exposure to intermittent exposure, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. We found that reducing the amount of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, and reducing the rate of bronchial hyperreactivity. We did not find any evidence to suggest that reducing exposure to the agent reduced the number of people who developed bronchiolitis. We also found no evidence to support or refute the use of reduced exposure to reduce the risk of bronchiectasis. The evidence is current to January 2015.
This review included six randomised controlled trials with a total of 1758 participants. All participants were from the outpatient setting and had either nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis (LA grade A or B). Five trials investigated on-demand deprescribing and one trial that had a mean age of 73 years. Participants were age 48 to 57 years, except for one trial where participants were aged between 48 and 57 years. The average age of participants in the trials ranged from 73 years to 48 years. There was no difference in the number of people who died or had serious adverse events between the two treatment groups. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review authors found that on- demand deprescription may be effective in reducing the risk of death or serious adverse effects in adults with esophageal reflux. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of trials included in this review and the small numbers of participants included in the included trials. There is a need for larger, well-designed, and well-conducted randomised trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of this intervention.
We included 13 randomised controlled trials (975 participants) comparing social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group. We found evidence in favour of social skills programme compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79, very low quality evidence), and rehospitalisation (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, 143, RR 1.14 CI 1.06 to 1.26, very high quality evidence). We also found that rates of relapse were low for social skills, and high for standard care on all measures of social functioning. We did not find any evidence of a difference between social skills and standard care in terms of the number of people who relapsed or rehospitalised. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
Only one study (225 participants, 145 with tophi at baseline) met the inclusion criteria for this review. This study showed that pegloticase 8 mg infusion every two weeks reduced tophi in the subset of participants who had tophi, but increased withdrawals in those who had not taken tophi for at least two weeks. This was the pooled results from two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 225 participants randomised to one of three treatment groups. The other two RCTs showed no difference in the number of people who withdrew from the study. There was no difference between the groups in terms of number of participants taking tophi and those who did not take tophi. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the amount of time that participants took tophi or withdrawals. The quality of the evidence from one study was moderate-quality, meaning that we are very uncertain about the results. The evidence from the other two studies was very low-quality because of the small number of included in the study and the small numbers of participants in the studies.
This review identified five studies on oral immunoglobulin for the prevention of NEC of which three met the inclusion criteria. In this review of the three eligible trials (including 2095 neonates, 1840 infants), the oral administration of IgG or an IgG/IgA combination did not result in a significant reduction in the incidence of definite NEC (typical risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.25; typical risk difference -0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies, 1840 newborns), suspected NEC, suspected NEC and suspected NEC combined did not reduce the risk of NEC. In addition, there was no difference in the number of infants who developed NEC after receiving IgG and IgA. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Five trials compared no additional treatment with additional chemotherapy after hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Four trials compared platinum based combination chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy directly with chemotherapy. One trial compared two different chemotherapy regimens and found the relative risk of death to be 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) = 25; absolute risk reduction reduction from adjuvant chemotherapy (RR 0.88 (0.79 to 099)). Sensitivity analysis focused on trials of modern platinum based chemotherapy and found a significant overall survival advantage from treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy compared to treatment with no treatment. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of women who died from any cause. However, there was a significant difference in the proportion of women in the two treatment groups who had a serious adverse event (e.g. bleeding). There were no differences in the percentage of women with serious adverse events between the treatment groups. The overall quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of trials included in this review.
We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries, on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high- income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital health interventions, for example medication reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information. Our synthesis showed that client' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes targeted client-specific communication, while others felt that the programmes were more generalised. The evidence is current to May 2015.
Twenty-three randomised controlled trials involving 2467 people were included. Comparing methadone versus any other pharmacological treatment, we observed no clinical difference between the two treatments in terms of completion of treatment, 16 studies 1381 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.37); degree of discomfort for withdrawal, three studies, 386 participants, RR 0.98; number of participants abstinent at follow-up, two studies, 467 participants; and number of people who stopped taking their medication, one study, 456 participants. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Nine studies involving 1109 participants met the inclusion criteria for the review. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but less prolonged than withdrawal managed with reducing doses of methadone, and doses of naltrexone sufficient for blockade of opioid effects can be established significantly more quickly with antagonist-induced withdrawals than withdrawal management managed with clonidine and symptomatic medications. The level of sedation does not affect the intensity and duration of withdrawal, although the duration of anaesthesia may influence withdrawal severity. Adverse effects of opioid withdrawal are less severe with antagonists than with other drugs. The effect of antagonist withdrawal on opioid withdrawal is less severe than withdrawal with other medications, but the effect on withdrawal severity is more severe with antagonist withdrawal. The number of participants in the studies was similar between the two treatment groups. There was no difference in the number of people who died or were admitted to hospital. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included fourteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 150 participants. The duration of the studies ranged from very short (10 days) studies of the intramuscular preparation, to trials lasting over three months. The strength of the evidence relating to this compound is limited, owing to small sample size, poor study design, limited outcomes and incomplete reporting. When compared to other typical antipsychotic drugs, we found no evidence of a difference in effectiveness (doctors' 4 RCTs n=150, RR 1.23, CI 0.69 to 1.86; nurses' 4RCTS n=146, RR 2.78, CI 1.82 to 2.86). Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2 studies n=60, RR 3.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77). There is insufficient evidence to support the use of molindone for the treatment of schizophrenia.
We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. Each study involved a different set of interventions. They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide, and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite. The evidence is current to January 2015. We found that hydroquinones were significantly more effective at lightening melasma when compared to other treatments alone, or when used in combination with other treatments. However, we could not combine the results due to the heterogeneity of the studies and the small number of participants in the included studies. We also found that there was no clear difference in the number of people who developed melasma between the treatment groups. There was not enough information to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of any of the treatments.
Twelve randomised controlled trials, which randomised 1319 participants, were included in the review. Of note, only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU and this paper was at high risk of reporting bias. Not all studies reported population characteristics, of those that did mean age ranged from 61 to 75 year old. 83% of participants were white and 40% were male. A significant reduction in surgical failure in the first year after trabeculectomy was detected in the studies that reported this outcome. However, there was no difference in the number of people who had to have surgery for the first time and those undergoing surgery for their first time receiving regular-dose 5FU postoperative. There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of participants who had an adverse event. The quality of the trials was not high, including the risk of bias in many of the studies.
The evidence is current to January 2015. We found 50 studies with 16,154 participants. Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second in COPD patients. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in patients with COPD, although one major trial (4823 participants) showed a statistically significant difference with ICS over placebo (dummy medication). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of lung function. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included 80 randomised controlled trials (5820 women) comparing 20 different NSAIDs (18 non-selective and two COX-2-specific) versus placebo, paracetamol or each other. NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo (4.37, 95% CI 3.76 to 5.09; 35 RCTs, 53%, low quality evidence). This suggests that if 18% of women taking placebo achieve moderate or excellent pain relief, between 45% and 53% taking NSAIDs will do so. Among women with primary dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation), NSAIDs are more effective than placebo. However, NSAIDs are associated with a higher risk of serious side effects.
We included seven studies that compared high versus low levels of PEEP (2565 participants). In five of the studies (2417 participants), a comparison was made between high- and low-level PEEP with the same tidal volume in both groups, but in the remaining two studies (148 participants), the tidal volume was different between high and low levels. We found no evidence of differences between the two groups in terms of the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event. We did not find any evidence of difference between the groups in the proportion of participants who had a high or a low-quality quality of life. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low or very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. The evidence is current to January 2015.
This review included 42 studies (11,399 patients) including 19 studies from the original review (2010), as well as 23 new studies. Overall, there was a significant increase in the need for RRT in the HES compared to individual individual creatinine data for the calculation of RIFLE criteria. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients who had to be treated for kidney failure. However, there were no differences between the groups in the proportion of patients with kidney failure who required dialysis. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of patients included in the studies.
We found nine studies that enrolled 682 participants. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale with no treatment and two made comparisons with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Compared with SCr and BUN, the plant had a positive effect on SCr (MD -87.49 µmol/L, 95% CI -139.25 to -35.72) and a statistically significant effect on BUN (MD-10.61 mmol/L -95%CI -19.45 to -2.21). The plant did not have an effect on other outcomes, such as SCr, BUN or SCr-related quality of life. There was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who died. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the studies. The quality of the evidence was low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included 13 papers, representing data from 2745 individuals with dementia (n = 1413 (51%) with dementia). We found no significant differences in test accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P = 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting. There was a statistically significant difference between the test accuracy and the negative likelihood ratio between the tested test and the test in the'specialist memory setting' (P= 0.14) and the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6). There was no significant difference in the accuracy of the test between the tests in the general and specialist memory settings. There were no differences in the sensitivity or specificity of the tests. We found that the test was more accurate in the specialised memory setting than the general memory setting. However, we found no differences between the two settings in the number of false positives or false negatives. We judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate to very low.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 91 participants. All three studies investigated various types and intensities of outpatient rehabilitation programmes in adults with chronic stroke. Rehabilitation programmes included: modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) compared with a neurodevelopmental therapy programme; task practice therapy with cyclic functional electrical stimulation (FES), and occupational, manual therapy with dynamic elbow extension splinting compared with non-invasive therapy (BoNT). All studies were of low to very low quality. The evidence is current to May 2016. We found three studies with 91 participants in total. All three studies scored 'low quality' on the methodological quality assessment, implying high risk of bias. One study reported that participants in the control group were more likely to have a stroke than those in the intervention group. The other two studies reported that people in the treatment group were less likely to experience a stroke. There was no difference in the number of people who had a stroke compared with those who did not. Two of the three studies reported no serious adverse events. Only one study reported a serious adverse event. The third study did not report any serious adverse effects. In conclusion, the quality of the evidence was very low. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. Further research is needed.
Four randomised controlled trials, recruiting 136 participants, were included in this review. Two trials compared lamivudine alone versus HBIg (hepatitis B immune globulin) and one trial compared combination treatment with lamivUDine. The other two trials compared combination therapy with LBIg and HBIG. Randomisation was performed one week after transplantation in one of the trials; from transplantation until randomisation in another trial; and after six months after treatment with the combination therapy in the third trial. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of patients who died. There were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of people who experienced serious adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of combination therapy for the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
We found 15 studies, involving 1019 participants who were followed between three months to 10 years. Sulphonylurea (one study) did not improve metabolic control significantly more than insulin alone at three months, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, and at 12 months with insulin, but it improved metabolic control compared to insulin alone. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. There was no clear difference between the two treatment groups in the number of participants who died or developed serious complications. There were no clear differences between the groups in terms of the proportion of people who developed serious side effects. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included 70 studies (44,958 participants) in the review, and 63 studies (42,784 participants) were included in the meta-analyses. Overall, the risk of bias in the studies was moderate or low, meaning that these studies provided moderate to low quality evidence. Outcomes at four or more months post-intervention were of particular interest to assess when effects were sustained beyond the immediate short term. We have reported pooled effects across delivery modes only for those analyses only for which heterogeneity across delivery mode is not substantial (I2 < 50%). Alcohol-related problem-related problems at four-month follow-up: IFF standardised mean difference (SMD -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.25) - 0.26, IFF 0.24, SMD 0.28, SMT 0.29, SMS 0.30, SMC 0.34, SMG 0.33, SMF 0.35, SMU 0.36, SMP 0.38, SMB 0.40, SML 0.41, SMR 0.42, SMV 0.43, SMX 0.44, SMZ 0.46, SMQ 0.48, SMW 0.50, SMY 0.52, SMH 0.53, SMN 0.55, SME 0.57, SMI 0.56, SMO 0.60, SMM 0.61, SMK 0.62, SMUS 0.63, SMSP 0.65, SMSS 0.66, SMPS 0.67, SMTS 0.68, SMRT 0. We found that there was no significant difference in the number of people who had alcohol problems at the end of the intervention period compared to those who did not receive the intervention. There was no difference between the groups in the proportion of people with alcohol problems. There were no significant differences in the percentage of people in the treatment groups who had a serious side effect. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of included studies, the small numbers of participants, and the low number of participants in the included studies. There is a need for more high-quality, well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trials.
We included three randomised controlled trials with a total of 492 participants who had received 530 THA. One study (81 participants) compared the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restriction versus no provision. The other two studies (52 participants each) compared THA with no provision, and the third study (48 participants) did not provide any treatment. The evidence presented in this review is of very low quality. Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if the provision provided by THA is beneficial or harmful for participants randomised to the provision or not. We are uncertain whether THA provides any benefit or harm for participants randomly allocated to THA or to a control group. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants included in the studies and the low risk of bias in the included studies.
Three randomised controlled trials were included in this review. In two trials, there was a statistically significant reduction in the recurrence of painful periods in the LNG-IUD group compared with expectant management (RR 0.22, 95 women, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.60, I2 = 0%, moderate strength of evidence). In the third trial, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the number of women who experienced painful periods. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the length of time it took for women to return to normal menstrual bleeding. There were no significant differences in the amount of pain experienced by women in either group. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We included 24 studies, with the majority (20/24) conducted in laboratory settings (17/24), and used between-participants designs (19/24). All studies were conducted in high-income countries, predominantly in the USA. Most studies (4/6) manipulated snack food or drink, of which two changed the absolute number of different options available, and four altered the relative proportion of less-healthy options. Six studies investigated availability interventions (investigations by nurses designed to test a hypothesized cause effect by modifying the supposed causal factor in the study population). For selection outcomes, meta-analysis of three studies (n = 154) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a large reduction in selection, and a reduction in the number of people who chose to eat less or drink more than they would otherwise have done. However, there was no clear difference in the proportion of people choosing to eat more or drink less. The quality of the evidence was very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
We found only one randomised controlled trial (a type of study in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that investigated the effect of PEP on the transmission of HIV in patients with HIV-infected blood vessels. We found that PEP was associated with a significant increase in the risk of HIV transmission in the blood vessels of patients who were treated with PEP. However, there was no clear evidence of a difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of people who developed HIV infection. There was no evidence of an effect on the rate of death from any cause. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of patients included in the study and the small size of the study.
The review found that CBT has small to moderate effects on pain, disability, mood and catastrophising immediately post-treatment, but not on pain or mood, when compared with treatment as usual/waiting list, but all except a small effect on mood had disappeared at follow-up. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CBT for the treatment of depression.
We found 15 national initiatives, including more than 260,000 people, that met the inclusion criteria. None of the initiatives were provided in low-middle-income or low-income countries. All initiatives except one used an uncontrolled pre-post study to evaluate interventions rather than on pooled data from multiple individual initiatives. We found no evidence that any of the national initiatives had an effect on health-related quality of life. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of national initiatives included in the review and the lack of high-quality studies.
We found seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met our inclusion criteria. All studies had a small number of participants, ranging from seven to 16 people per study, and had a cross-over design. Studies evaluating bromocriptine, clonidine, Amitriptyline, propranolol, levodopa (Prolopa®) and tryptophan (one study) were of low risk of bias, while four studies were of uncertain risk. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found seven studies that met the inclusion criteria, but only seven met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, the UK, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands. The results of these studies were inconclusive. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low or very low, meaning that we are uncertain about the results of the included studies. There is a need for more high-quality, well-designed and well-conducted RCTs to assess the effectiveness and safety of these drugs.
We found 10 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1015 participants. All studies compared an enteral formula or additional supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, gamma-linolenic acid), and antioxidants) to placebo. Studies were heterogenous in nature and varied in several ways, including type and duration of intervention given, calorific targets, and reported outcomes. We assessed some of the included studies as having high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings. For the primary outcome, study authors reported the number of participants who died, study participants who were admitted to hospital, and study participants with chronic lung disease. We found no evidence to support the use of supplements for the prevention of lung disease in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or COPD. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included in the studies. The quality of evidence was moderate to low for lung disease, COPD, COPD, and COPD-related quality of life, and low for other outcomes.
The evidence is current to January 2015. We included 33 studies that compared open questions with checklist-type questions or rating scales. We found that more specific questioning of participants led to more AE when an initial open enquiry was used, while some less severe, bothersome, or clinically relevant AEs were only reported with a subsequent specific enquiry. However, two studies showed that quite severe or debilitating AE was more common when more specific questions were asked. We did not find any evidence of a difference between the two types of questions in terms of the number of AEs detected. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and differences in the way the studies were conducted.
We identified 582 records from the databases and search strategies. We found 10 further records by searching other resources (handsearching). We removed 211 duplicate records and screened 381 records for inclusion in the review. We excluded 15 studies: eight studies did not assess interventions to prevent SUDEP, five studies measured sensitivity of devices to detect GTCS but did not directly measure SUDEP-related symptoms, and two studies assessed risk factors for SUDEP. We assessed 17 full-text articles. The evidence is current to January 2016. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and the small numbers of patients included in the studies. There is a need for more high-quality, well-designed and well-conducted studies.
In this review, we found seven randomised controlled trials, of which seven (n = 208) were eligible for inclusion. The total study duration varied between four days and two years. One study was of parallel design with the remaining six being cross-over in design in design; participant numbers ranged from 17 to 75. Participants were followed for four days to two years, and the duration of the interventions varied between 24 hours and 365 days. The average age of participants ranged from 35 to 72 years. We found no evidence that any of the included studies were of high quality. There was no evidence of a difference between the interventions in terms of the number of people who experienced side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be moderate to low.
Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta-analyses. Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.74), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer-term assessments of CBT.
Twelve randomised controlled trials (1,856 women) met the inclusion criteria. Eight of the included trials compared progestogen treatment with placebo and the remaining four trials compared no treatment with no treatment. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias, conducted in India, Jordan, UK, USA and USA. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials. In five trials women had had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in seven trials women were having two or more miscarriages. The average duration of the trials varied across the trials. There was no difference in the number of women who had a miscarriage with progestogens or with placebo. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the proportion of women having a miscarriage. There is no evidence to support or refute the use of progestogenic drugs for the treatment of multiple miscarriages in women. The evidence is current to January 2015.
In this review, we found 14 studies with 1298 participants that compared CM versus control, and five studies (594 participants) compared MIB interventions versus control. We did not find any studies that assessed other types of psychosocial interventions (such as counselling, psychotherapy, or psychotherapy-based interventions). The included studies rarely captured maternal and neonatal outcomes. For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately controlled for bias within their studies as such information was not often reported. We assessed the quality of the included studies as low or very low because of the small number of included studies and the small numbers of participants. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of CM or MIB in the management of postpartum depression. The quality of evidence was very low due to the low number of studies and small sample sizes.
We identified 31 studies (44 reports) including 27,071 participants and two ongoing studies. The risk of bias in the studies was low or unclear for several domains. The transradial approach reduced short-term net adverse clinical events (NACEs) (i.e. the number of people who had a heart attack or heart failure during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow-up) compared to the transfemoral approach. However, the risk of death was similar between both groups (11,170 participants; 11 studies; moderate quality evidence), cardiac death was not significantly different between the groups (4 studies; high quality evidence) and there was no difference between the two groups in the rate of myocardial infarction (short-term heart failure) or death from any cause. There was no clear difference in the proportion of patients who had to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or who were discharged from the ICU. The quality of the evidence was moderate or very low for all outcomes.
We found two studies of palliative care interventions for people with advanced dementia. Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because they did not measure the same outcome that can be measured. One study (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a palliatives care team for people for people who had advanced dementia, and the other study (97 participants) looked at the effects of a team of people working together. The two studies measured 31 different outcomes and the settings were different. We did not pool data due to the heterogeneity between the two studies and small sample sizes meant that the overall certainty of all the evidence was very low. There are six ongoing studies that we expect to include in future versions of this review.
Three trials reporting two different sequencing comparisons were identified. There were no significant differences between the various methods of sequencing. Concurrent chemoradiation increased anaemia, telangiectasia and pigmentation in 1166 women in three trials based on 1166 randomised women. There was no significant difference in overall survival, relapse-free survival, overall survival and metastasis free survival based on three trials in three different groups of women. However, there was a significant increase in the number of women who had to have surgery to remove the tumour. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference between the different methods of chemotherapy.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving a total of 622 participants. The RCTs were conducted in the community setting, with interventions mainly delivered by health professionals, and had a short- to medium-term follow-up (up to 24 weeks). Three RCTS compared CrP plus resistance or weight training with placebo, the other RCT was conducted with CrP alone versus placebo, and therefore assessed the results according to CrP dose. However, we focused this review on investigating which dose of CrP would prove most effective versus placebo. We found no evidence that CrP was more effective than placebo in reducing the number of participants who dropped out of the studies. We did not find any evidence of a difference between CrP and placebo in improving the quality of life of the participants. There was no evidence of any difference in the proportion of people who were able to return to work after the end of the study. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly due to the small numbers of participants in the studies and the small number of studies.
Eleven studies with a total of 886 participants were included in the review. These evaluated a range of comparisons comparing different types of antiseptic preparations for wound healing by secondary intention. The studies were small and some did not present data that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors reduced the quality of the evidence and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatment preparations or analyses. Two comparisons compared different iodine preparation preparations with no antiseptics. The results of these studies were inconclusive. There is a need for more high-quality randomised controlled trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of these preparations.
We included five randomised studies with a total of 1049 women evaluating five different techniques during either amniocentesis (three studies) or CVS (two studies). There was no conclusive evidence of benefit for any of them. In the absence of clear evidence, the quality of evidence summarised in this review is not of sufficient quality to change current clinical practice. The same applies for terbutaline tocolysis and use of continuous vacuum aspiration during CVS.
We included 10 studies: four provided data for quantitative analyses (437 participants), five studies were randomised trials (1182 participants), three studies were non-RCTs (1181 participants, 8037 live births), two studies were interrupted time series studies (1 study of 2,242,438, 1 study unreported), and one study was conducted in a lower-middle-income country (Bangladesh). Seven studies examined wheat flour fortified with folic acid alone or with other micronutrients. The duration of interventions ranged from two weeks to 36 months, and the ITS studies included postfortification periods. Six studies were conducted in upper-middle and upper-income countries (China, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, and Canada). Three studies included maize flour (Ground up seed of WHEAT), and two studies included sugarcane flour. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of fortified foods to reduce the risk of preterm birth. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. We did not find any evidence to suggest that fortified foods reduce preterm births or preterm deaths. However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies and the short duration of the studies. We are uncertain whether or not fortified foods have any effect on preterm and preterm death rates. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether fortified foods are effective in preventing preterm or premature deaths.
This review identified six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1,124,483 neonates (210 with CF) with a maximum follow-up of 17 years. Two of these studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and one was funded by a pharmaceutical company. The other two studies were sponsored by a non-profit organisation. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that screening newborns with severe malnutrition was less common among screened participants than among those who were not screened. Severe malnutrition was also less common in the screened participants compared with the control group. At age seven, 88% of screened participants and 75% of the control participants had severe malnutrition, compared with just over half of the participants in the screening group. There was no difference between the two groups in the proportion of newborns who were overweight or obese. There were no differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of included studies and the small numbers of participants.
We found five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'low' or'standard' blood pressure, and using more antihypertensive medications in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly low blood pressure (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5mmHg, P < 0.0001), the only significant benefit was achieved in the group that used more drugs. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in the number of people who died from any cause. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of participants in the trials and the small numbers of participants.
Fourteen randomised controlled trials (709 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review. One study compared two different types of non-removable casts with no discernable difference between the groups. Seven studies (366 participants) compared non- removable casts with removable pressure-relieving devices. Two studies (98 participants) found that significantly more ulcers healed than with dressings alone. There was no difference in the number of ulcers between the two groups at 7 months of follow-up. There were no significant differences in the length of time it took for the ulcers to heal. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 235 participants met the eligibility criteria for the review. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. Two trials of computer-assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions and one of physical activity training interventions were identified. One trial of meditation (N = 95), one of meditation and one physical activity intervention were identified, all of which focused on women with breast cancer. There was no evidence that any of the interventions had an effect on survival or quality of life. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included five trials, all from the 1970s, randomising 343 participants. Results from the included trials found that, in terms of global state improvement, when rated by a psychiatrist, there was no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.98). Only short-term data were available. The overall methodology and data reporting by the trials was poor (below the standard of the community). We excluded one trial from the review.
Five randomised trials were identified with a total of 207 participants, 102 to colorectal stenting and 105 to emergency surgery. The average time of clinical relief of obstruction was 0.66 days in the colonic stent group and was 3.55 day in the emergency surgery group. The stent insertion was successful in 86.02% of attempted stent placements. There was no statistically significant difference in the 30-day mortality between two groups of participants. The 30 day mortality rate was similar, 2.3% in both groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of people who died within 30 days of stent placement.
We included nine randomised controlled trials (1867 women) comparing human albumin (seven RCTs) or HES or mannitol (one RCT) versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of OHSS. There was evidence of a beneficial effect of intravenous albumin on OHSS, though heterogeneity was substantial (Peto OR 0.67 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95, seven studies, 1452 high risk women); I² = 69%, very low quality evidence). The main limitations were imprecision, poor reporting of study methods, and failure to blind women to outcome assessment.
Ten studies involving 484 patients were included in this review. There was no evidence of superiority of any one sclerosant over another, but there was some evidence suggesting that polidocanol was more likely to cause adverse reactions at a concentration of 1% compared with lower concentration or hypertonic saline, and that sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) was more than twice as likely to result in adverse reactions compared with placebo. The evidence did not suggest an increase in patient satisfaction with any one agent versus another.
We included seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 241 participants in this review. Most of the studies did not provide sufficient information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias. Salbutamol (primarily used as a bronchodilator) was found to reduce serum potassium levels, but there is evidence that several commonly used therapies, such as corticosteroids, are effective in preventing these outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of these drugs for the prevention of clinically relevant clinical outcomes.
Thirty-nine studies, enrolling 4216 participants, were included in this review, however only 30 studies, involving 3392 participants, contained enough data to be meta-analysed. Studies compared antimicrobial lock solutions to standard sealing solutions (usually heparin) of the CVC for HD (a malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue). Fifteen studies used antibiotic lock solutions, 21 used non-antibiotic lock solutions (a device that consists of an antimicrobial drug powder packaged in vials in specified amounts and intended for use in clinical laboratories for determining in vitro susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to these therapeutic agents), and 4 used both (antibiotics and non-Antibiotic). Risk of bias was low or unclear for most domains in the majority of the included studies.
We identified 15 eligible studies (1098 participants). Of these, six investigated pre-emptive treatment versus placebo or treatment of CMV when disease occurred (standard care), eight looked at antiviral treatment versus antiviral prophylaxis, and one reported on oral versus intravenous treatment. All studies were considered to be at low risk of attrition. Assessment of risk of bias identified that the processes reported for sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low-risk of bias in only five and three studies, respectively. There was no significant difference in the number of deaths or serious adverse events between pre- and intravenous anti-CMV treatment and placebo. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who died or developed serious adverse effects between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was low for all outcomes.
We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 140 participants and ranged from six weeks to five months in duration. All three RCTs compared the effect of sweet potato preparation with placebo on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at three and five months with 4 g/day preparation compared to placebo (mean difference -0.3% (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 0.04); P = 0.02; 122 participants; 2 trials). No serious adverse effects were reported. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the three studies. The quality of the evidence was low or very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We found 19 studies, involving a total of 440 participants. Five randomised controlled studies (192 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor. The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants, and the age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 22.33 years). In 13 studies, follow up lasted a single day; however, there were two long-term studies with follow up of one to three years. The 14 remaining studies were cross-over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of people who died or had a serious adverse event between the two groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 733 women in total that compared brief co-incubation and the standard insemination protocol were included in this review. The low quality of the evidence showed that there was an increased ongoing pregnancy rate in two trials including 426 women. There was no difference in the number of ongoing pregnancies between the two protocols. There were 127 ongoing pregnancies in the two trials compared to the standard protocol (pooled odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.55 to 3.77; P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). Live birth was not reported in the included studies. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of short-term co-insemination for the treatment of preterm pregnancy.
In this review, we found five randomised controlled trials involving a total of 694 newborns. Most of the participants had single pathology (HMD) and no studies examined the effects of IT on newborns ventilated for other reasons such as meconium aspiration and congenital heart disease (lungs with normal compliance). The studies were conducted prior to the introduction of antenatal steroids, post-natal natal surfactant and the use of synchronised modes of ventilatory support. Long IT was associated with an increase in mortality before hospital discharge that reached borderline statistical significance. There was no significant difference in the incidence of BPD (bipolar disorder) in newborns who received IT. There were no significant differences in the number of babies who died or were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included 33 studies involving 5110 patients in this review. Most of the studies were of low methodological quality. There is a large variety in the ways the TFU was performed (the health professionals who undertook the intervention, frequency, structure, duration and duration, duration, etc.). Many different outcomes have been measured, but only a few were measured across more than one study. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence about the effects of TFU. TFU has been applied in many patient groups, although some studies find that the intervention had favourable effects for some outcomes, overall the studies show clinically-equivalent results between TFU and control groups. No adverse effects were reported. In summary, we cannot conclude that TFU is an effective intervention.
We identified 38 trials that evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentive schemes, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural and methodological interventions, and new medical test kits. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaire and new questionnaire formats. For four trials retention was communication strategies. For the remaining four trials, we found no evidence that any of the strategies were effective in improving retention. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved a total of 829 participants (416 and 413 participants in the pLMA and cLMA groups, respectively). We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and data related to the first treatment period for the other five studies were not yet available. No studies reported significant differences between device types in relation to the primary review outcome (e.g. the number of people who had a bleeding episode). Seven included studies provided information related to more than one secondary outcome (i.e. adverse events) and eight studies provided data for the primary outcome. We were unable to combine the results of these studies because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included in the studies. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low, mainly due to the low number of participants in each study and the lack of data on adverse events.
We included 19 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1453 participants from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Fourteen trials specifically recruited only children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. We found no evidence of a difference between the two groups in terms of the number of children who developed diarrhoea. There was no clear difference in the amount of time children spent on the toilet. There were no clear differences between the groups in the length of hospital stay. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The main limitations of this review were the small number of studies and the small numbers of children included in the studies.
We included 22 studies involving 4490 participants. All were randomised trials (3 were cluster RCTs), and 19 of the 22 studies had analysable outcome data. Most of the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection of bias. Seventeen of the included studies had student populations. Findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes (n = 1196) were mixed, with effects showing a reduction, increase or consistent with no evidence of effect. The median standardised mean difference (SMD) for the three trials (394) with continuous outcomes was -0.25, with SMDs ranging from 0.85 (95% confidence interval of interest, e.g. -1.39 to 0.31) to -0 (0.17) and SMD for the four trials with continuous outcomes (n= 1196). Findings were mixed for the five studies with discrimination outcomes (N = 394) and the four studies with continuous measures of SMD were mixed. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of children who had a reduction in the amount of blood in their urine, or the number who had an increase in the rate of blood loss. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 85 studies in our review. Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income and 15 low-income, in rural, urban and semi-urban locations. We found 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context (11 findings, five moderate- or high-confidence); service design and provision (the act of working out the form of something, or the result of the provision and design and design of a service); and service delivery (the way in which the service is delivered and delivered to women and their healthcare providers). The evidence is current to January 2016. The evidence was up to date to January 2015. The review found that there was no difference in the number of women or healthcare providers who were satisfied with the way the service was delivered. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low. The main limitations of the review were the small number of studies and the small numbers of women included in the studies. There was not enough information available to draw any firm conclusions about the effects of the service on the health of the mother, the baby, the healthcare provider or both. There were no differences between the studies in terms of the quality of care provided to the mother and her healthcare provider. There is a need for more high-quality, well-designed and well-conducted studies to assess the impact of service delivery on health-related outcomes.
Sixteen randomised controlled trials, involving 3361 patients, were included in the review; three of the studies were of magnesium sulphate in addition to nimodipine. Calcium antagonists reduce the occurrence of secondary ischaemia and showed a favourable trend for case fatality. For calcium antagonists alone the results were not statistically significant, for other calcium antagonists or intravenous administration of calcium antagonists there was no difference in the risk of poor outcome: the relative risk of death was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.92); the corresponding number of patients needed to treat with calcium antagonists was 19. Cal calcium antagonists were associated with an increased risk of side effects, but the results of this review were not significant.
We found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 739 children. They all used an age of one year as the cut-off point for pre-treatment risk stratification. There was a significant statistical difference in event-free survival in favour of myeloablative therapy over conventional chemotherapy or no further treatment (three studies, 739 patients; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90). There was also a significant difference in the proportion of children who survived with no sign of a particular complication of disease during the first year of treatment. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the number of deaths or serious adverse events. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in the percentage of children with a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence was moderate to very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We found eight randomised clinical trials (632 participants) that met our inclusion criteria. The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years. The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 22% to 85%. The median follow-up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months). All eight trials were at high risk of bias, and we rate the evidence as low to very low certainty. TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all-cause mortality at three years' follow up (risk of death from any cause). TACE may also have reduced the risk of liver cancer recurrence. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in the number of people who developed liver cancer. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of people included in the trials.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) that compared increased versus standard energy intake in infants with CLD/BPD. Fourteen studies that appeared to be relevant were excluded from the review, as no study directly compared increased energy intake with standard intake. However, two excluded trials provided some insights into the topic. One study showed that infants who were fed formula enriched with protein and minerals had improved growth parameters up until the cessation of the intervention at three months of corrected age. The other study compared different energy density of formula but identical energy intake by setting different feed volumes for both groups. It showed that both groups were unable to achieve the pre-designated feed volumes and that there were no differences in growth parameters between the groups. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of babies who were able to reach their pre-designed feed volumes. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of included studies and the small numbers of infants included in the included studies.
We found 13 studies enrolling 2341 participants (and involving 2360 procedures) that met our inclusion criteria. The quality of evidence was very low or low for most outcomes, moderate for one outcome (femoral vein and femoral vein) and high at best for two outcomes (subclavian vein N = 4, femoral veins N = 2) for most outcomes. Most of the trials had unclear risk of bias, which means that we cannot be certain of the results. The evidence is up to date as of May 2016. The trials included in this review were of low or very low quality. There was no clear difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who died, the length of hospital stay, the time to return to work, or the cost of the procedure. There were no clear differences between the groups in the amount of time taken for the procedure to be completed or in the time it took for the patient to be discharged from the hospital. In addition, there was not enough information available to be able to draw any conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of any of the interventions. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether any of these interventions are effective in reducing the risk of death or hospital stay.
Fifteen studies were included using four different methods of administration of physostigmine (rapidly absorbed through membranes). Four studies, 29 people, used intravenous infusion; seven, 131 people used a conventional oral form; four, 1456 people used verum skin patch; and one study of 181 people used an oral form. There are no usable results from the oral form trials. The few results obtained from the controlled-release oral form trial were of low quality.
We included 13 randomised controlled trials involving a total of 16,112 participants. Eleven trials recruited participants with history of coronary heart disease, two trials recruited people with a history of stroke, and one trial recruited patients with a mix of people with CVD and stroke. We judged overall risk of bias to be moderate (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider). The meta-analysis of the trials found that there was no difference between the two groups in the number of people who had a stroke and those who did not have a stroke. There was no clear difference in the risk of death or serious adverse events between the groups. There were no clear differences in the proportion of patients who experienced a serious adverse event. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Twelve randomised controlled trials involving 3285 healthy women at low risk of excessive bleeding undergoing elective CS (nine trials, 2453 participants) or spontaneous birth (three trials, 832 participants) satisfied inclusion criteria and contributed data to the analysis. All participants received routine prophylactic uterotonics in accordance with the local guideline in addition to TA or placebo or no intervention. Overall, included studies had moderate risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting and incomplete data. The quality of evidence was also as assessed using GRADE. Blood loss greater than 400 mL or 500 mL, and more than 1000 mL was less common in women who received TA or no treatment compared with women who did not receive any treatment. There was no significant difference in the number of women who needed to be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or neonatal intensive care units (NICU). There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the included studies. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We found 12 studies (2494 participants) comparing amantadine with placebo, paracetamol, or zanamivir to treat influenza A in children (773 participants), and 545 elderly (1586 children and 908 elderly) to prevent influenza A. We found no difference in the number of deaths or serious adverse events between the two treatments. There was no difference between the treatment groups in the proportion of children who died or had serious adverse effects. There were no differences between the treatments in the percentage of people who had a serious adverse event. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Nine trials, which included a total of 1512 women, met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review. Most of these studies included women with unexplained infertility who were undergoing IUI and in two studies the women were trying to conceive from sexual intercourse. Eight trials compared intentional endometrial injury in the cycle prior to IUI with no injury/placebo procedure; of these two trials, one trial found no difference in the number of women who had a miscarriage. Two trials found no significant difference between the two groups. One trial found that women who underwent IUI were more likely to have a miscarriage than those who did not have an IUI. There were no significant differences between the groups in the rate of women having a miscarriage after IUI compared to those who had no IUI, and there were no differences in the proportion of women with a miscarriage compared to women who were not having IUI in terms of number of miscarriages. The evidence is current to January 2015.
We included four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 3905 participants. We did not pool the results from one study (N = 834 participants), which was stopped at interim analysis due to lack of a clear difference between groups. We were unable to determine whether professional oral care compared with usual oral care resulted in a lower incidence rate of pneumonia over an 18-month period (hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.46; one study, 2513 participants analysed), low-quality evidence. We could not determine whether NHAP resulted in an increase in the number of first episodes of pneumonia compared to usual care. The quality of the evidence was low because of the small number of participants included in the studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies. The evidence is current to May 2016.
Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria for this review. These studies assessed bismuth subsalicylate versus placebo, budesonide versus placebo and beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine. The studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (receiving information from participants) and the study which assessed mesalazines versus cholestyramine was judged to have a high chance of bias. There was no difference in the number of people who died or had serious adverse events between the treatment groups. There were no differences between the groups in terms of side effects. The results of this review are based on five RCTs with a total of 149 participants. None of the studies reported on adverse events. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of salicylic acid for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Twelve randomised controlled trials were included and evaluated outcomes in 3259 randomised patients. Intervention duration ranged from 6 months to 12 months. Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMUG with SMUG, and one study (52 weeks) compared SMMG with SMBG, one trial (26 weeks) to 12 month SMBG (52 week) to SMMG, and two trials (26 week and 26 week SMBG) compared usual care to SMBG without monitoring. SMBG did not appear to be more effective than SMUG in improving quality of life, but SMBG was less likely to cause serious side effects than SMBG. There was no clear difference between SMBG and SMUG when it was compared to usual care. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate for all outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Eleven studies involving 471 participants met the inclusion criteria, although data were available from only five studies involving 276 participants with AsPD. Only two studies focused solely on an AsPD sample, and only one on aggression. Compared to the control condition, cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) plus standard maintenance was superior for outpatients with cocaine dependence in one study, but CBT alone did not improve the number of people who stopped using cocaine. There was no difference between CBT and standard maintenance in terms of recurrence of aggression, but there were no differences between the two treatment groups. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CBT for the treatment of AsPD in the short term.
This updated review included 11 studies. Six studies contributed to one or more analyses related to the common cold, with up to 1047 participants, five studies relating to purulent rhinitis, with a total of 791 participants, and one study contributed to data on adverse events and one met the inclusion criteria. There was a moderate risk of bias because of unreported methods, as outlined in the study but reported only summary statistics without providing any numerical data that could be included in the meta-analyses. A wide range of antibiotics were used and outcomes were measured in different ways. The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found that antibiotics are effective in reducing the number of people who develop a common cold. However, there was no clear difference between antibiotics and placebo in the proportion of people with a cold who developed a cold. The quality of the evidence is limited because some studies included only children, or only adults, and only males. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics for the treatment of common colds.
We included five randomised controlled trials (162 participants) in this review. Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years; only two participants were younger than 15 years. Twenty-three of 162 participants had streptococcus-positive throat swab culture. The mean PASI score at baseline varied from 5.7 to 23.7 (i.e. mild to severe) in four studies. We did not perform a meta-analysis of the results due to heterogeneity of participants' characteristics and intervention. One study declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and three were conducted in a hospital dermatology department. There was no difference in the number of participants who were treated with antibiotics and those who were not. There were no differences in the severity of psoriatic plaque at the end of treatment. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to September 2016.
We found 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling 933 participants with MS; 464 were randomised to the vitamin D group, and 469 to the comparator group. Vitamin D₃ had no effect on the annualised relapse rate at 52 weeks' follow-up (rate 0.05, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.07; I² = 38%; five trials; 417 participants); very low-quality evidence according to the GRADE instrument; on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (a system for quantifying disability), and one trial, which compared vitamin D with placebo. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low.
We included 62 studies, with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release preparations (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release (MIR) preparations for each arm of the trial, and one study compared MIR preparations with placebo preparations. The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief. Overall we judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poor (below the standard of the community).
Fourteen trials were included, totalling 1260 participants. The age of participants ranged from 16 to 88 years; and the majority of participants were women (approximately 70%). The average duration of symptoms ranged from three to 15 months, and the follow-up after the procedure ranged from eight weeks to 23 months. The studies reported nine types of comparison: open surgery versus steroid injections (two studies); percutaneous surgery versus ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injection (one study); open surgery plus steroid injection (five studies); steroid injection versus steroid injection alone (three studies); and steroid injection in combination with ultrasound. The average number of participants in each of the comparisons ranged from four to 12. The results of this review suggest that open surgery may be more effective than steroid injections for the treatment of trigger finger pain. However, there was no clear difference between open surgery and steroid injections in terms of the number of people who experienced pain at the end of the procedure. There was not enough evidence to determine whether open surgery was superior to steroid injections. There were no clear differences between the two types of surgery in the amount of time that participants were able to walk again, the length of hospital stay, or the time taken to return to normal activities of daily living. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.
Three randomised controlled trials, with 931 participants, tested different neoadjuvant treatments: RT alone; sequential RT and procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine chemotherapy; PCV chemotherapy alone; and temozolomide chemotherapy. None of the studies blinded participants or personnel, and, therefore, are considered at high risk of performance and detection bias. One study, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit of RT alone in terms of progression-free survival (PFS). The other two studies did not show a difference in PFS between RT alone and sequential RT, and the third study did not report a difference between RT and PCV alone. The studies were otherwise at low risk of bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether RT alone or sequential RT is superior to sequential RT for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
We included five randomised controlled trials with a total of 240 children aged one to 18 years with mild to moderate OSA. All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Three trials (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment); two RCTs compared oral montelukast versus placebo; and two trials compared oral mononitramine versus placebo. Follow-up time ranged from six weeks to four months. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support the use of intrananasal or oral monomonitramines for the treatment of OSA in children with OSA who are at high risk of developing asthma. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. We did not find any evidence of a difference in the number of children who developed asthma attacks or wheezing between the two treatment groups. There was no evidence of an effect on the risk of death or serious adverse events. We judged the quality of evidence to be low or very low because of the small number of trials and the small numbers of children included in the included trials.
This review included six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three clinical trials (CCTs) involving 1291 children. Of the six included RCTs/CCTs, five investigated the prevention of VTE compared with low-dose warfarin supplementation (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) n = 134, antithrombin (AT) supplementation n = 37, low-dosage warfarins (warfarin n = 31, cryoprecipitate and/or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) supplements n = 240, AT supplementation and LMWH n = 41) and one RCT/CCT investigated VTE supplementation compared with fibrinogen deficiency (low-dose FFP) supplementation in children with VTE. All studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR). The evidence is current to January 2016. The review found no evidence to support or refute the use of vitamin K supplementation in preventing VTE in children. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether vitamin K supplements prevent VTE, or whether they are associated with an increased risk of bleeding.
Three randomised controlled trials with a total of 287 participants operated on for Type I or II TAAA were included. In the first trial of 98 participants, neurological deficit in the lower extremities occurred in 14 (30%) of CSFD group and 17 (33%) controls. The deficit was observed within 24 hours of the operation in 21 (68%), and from three to 22 days in 10 (32%) participants. CSFD did not have a significant benefit in preventing ischaemic injury to the spinal cord in 10 participants. The second trial of 33 participants used CSFD and intrathecal papaverine. It showed a statistically significant reduction in the rate of postoperative neurological deficit (P = 0.039), compared to controls. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of participants who had a stroke. The third trial of 32 participants, which compared CSFD to a control group, did not show a significant difference in the risk of stroke. There was not enough evidence to recommend CSFD for the treatment of TAAA.
We included 13 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 662 participants. We found that NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI 75) in participants with CPP, but the difference was not statistically significant. In one RCT, we found no difference in the number of participants who withdrew from the study due to side-effects due to treatment, and in one study, we did not find any difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the proportion of people who withdrew because of side effects. There were no differences between the treatment groups for any of the primary outcomes of interest, which were global improvement, percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and Clearance rate (the amount of blood in the urine that is cleared from the skin after treatment). We found no differences in the percentage of people with psoriatic skin that was cleared from their urine after treatment. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for all of the outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Twenty one eligible studies were identified with a total of 1525 participants. About half of the trials had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment. One small trial showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence or the escape of stool from the rectum (fecal incontinence) 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94). One small study showed that biofeedbacks plus exercises (usually regular and done with the intention of improving or maintaining PHYSICAL FITNESS or HEALTH) were better than exercises alone. There was no clear difference in the number of people who were able to control their bladder with electrical stimulation compared to those who did not have electrical stimulation. There were no clear differences between the groups in terms of side effects. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
Thirty nine randomised trials were identified for inclusion in the review. They were generally small and of poor or moderate quality reporting data on only few outcomes. The data from five trials were heterogeneous but tended to indicate a higher risk of urinary tract infection if a catheter was not used postoperative, but not using one  The data gave only an imprecise estimate of any difference in urinary tract infections. Using a urinary catheter versus using one did not reduce the risk of re-catheterisation, but it did reduce the number of times the catheter had to be re-inserted. There was no clear difference in the rate of infection between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low.
Ten studies (3340 participants) were included in the review. Seven studies compared aripiprazole monotherapy versus placebo (2239 participants); two of these included a third comparison arm—one study used lithium (485 participants) and the other used haloperidol (480 participants). Two studies compared valproate or lithium as an adjunctive treatment (754 participants), and one study compared lithium versus placebo. Two studies found no difference between the two treatments in terms of adverse events. One study found no differences between the treatments in the proportion of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. The other study reported no difference in adverse events between the treatment and placebo groups. There were no differences in the number of people who experienced serious adverse events in either treatment group. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating urokinase lock treatment versus systemic antibiotic alone (n = 56 participants) and one CCT evaluating ethanol lock treatment with concomitant systemic antibiotic. No RCTs or CCTs evaluating antibiotic lock treatment were identified. All studies had methodological limitations and clinical heterogeneity between studies was present. We found no evidence of significant difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of participants cured of CVC-related infections, number of people treated with antibiotics and number of patients with recurrent CVC infections. There was no evidence that either treatment was superior to the other. The evidence is current to January 2015.
This review of 15 randomised controlled trials found that advice focusing on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain when compared with no treatment at intermediate-term, but not long-term follow-up. There is moderate quality evidence (one trial, 348 participants) that an educational video of advice focused on activation may be more beneficial than no treatment when compared to no treatment. However, there is low quality evidence that there is no difference between the two groups in terms of the number of people who experienced pain at the end of the intervention period.
In this Cochrane review, 49 studies and pieces of literature were included and formed the basis of a thematic synthesis, and which is presented in appendices to this review. The evidence is up-to-date as of September 2016. The results of this review are based on 49 studies that met the same population, intervention and outcome criteria as the review, but identified from the broader literature providing evidence on policy implementation and consumer experiences. No studies meeting the study design criteria were identified for inclusion in the review. Results of the thematic synthesisation indicate that ideally communication between policy makers and consumers should be aimed at improving the quality of life of people with mental health problems. However, there is not enough evidence to be able to draw any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of policy implementation.
We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo. After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRLSSS: MD -7.0; 95% CI -9.69 to -4.42 and the CGI: RR 2.14;95% ICI 1.49 to 2.48). The proportion of patients who were drug responders (remitters) was greater in the group treated with opioids than with placebo (RR 1.82; 95%) and the proportion of remitters was higher in the opioid-treated group than with the placebo. We found no evidence of a difference between the two treatment groups in terms of the number of people who were remitters, number of patients discharged from hospital, or number of hospital admissions. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. We judged the quality of evidence to be low due to the small number of participants in the trial and the small size of the trial.
Fifteen trials, involving 1022 adults with potentially or evidently unstable distal radial fractures, were included in this review. There was insufficient evidence to confirm a superior overall functional or clinical result for external fixation compared with plaster cast immobilisation. External fixation maintained reduced fracture positions (redisplacement requiring secondary treatment): 7/356 versus 51/338 (data from 9 trials); relative risk of late collapse and malunion: 0.17, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.32) and prevented late collapse, malunion and late collapse compared to plaster casts immobilisation, compared with no treatment. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants in the included trials. There is a need for more high-quality randomised controlled trials.
Five studies (1127 patients) were included in our analysis. Generally the risk of bias of the included studies was judged low or unclear; they addressed the research question and utilised a prospective randomised design. It is uncertain whether early stent removal verus removal improved the incidence of MUC. The incidence of UTI may be reduced in the early stents removal group (5 studies, 1127 participants: RR 1.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 5.71; I2 = 21%; low certainty). This possible reduction in the UTI incidence was only apparent if the stents were removed early. There was no clear difference between the groups in terms of the number of patients who had a UTI and those who did not. There were no clear differences between groups in the rate of side effects. The quality of the evidence was moderate.
We included five studies that evaluated three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns with fillings; two of them compared conventional PMCs with open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique with filling. One of these studies included a third arm, which allow the comparison of PMCs versus non-restorative caries treatment. In the two studies using crowns, there was no difference in the amount of tooth decay between the two groups. However, in the one study using fillings, there were no differences in the number of tooth abscesses between the groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. We judged the quality of evidence to be low or very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
We included 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) in this review. These studies compared PEP to ACBT, autogenic drainage, oral oscillating PEP, or both. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpieces was used. In 18 studies involving 296 participants, PEP was used in combination with ACBT. The studies did not provide enough information to be able to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of PEP in the treatment of COPD. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low for most of the outcomes. The evidence is current to January 2015.
Four studies involving 1485 participants met the inclusion criteria. All studies included active CD patients with CDAI ranging from 220 to 450. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age. CZP (100 mg to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks) was shown to be superior to placebo for achieving clinical remission at week 8 (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.66; moderate certainty). One study was identified as high risk of bias due to a non-identical placebo while the other studies were judged to be at low risk. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate.
In this review, we searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies in which people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that looked at the effects of CKD in people with CKD. One hundred and twelve studies met our selection criteria: 15 were studies of adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD); 16 studies were conducted in the general population but provided subgroup data for CKD; and 81 studies included individuals with CKD. Of the 31 studies (23,762 participants) with data on CKD patients, follow-up ranged from three months to five years, and study size ranged from 16 to 2916 participants. The risk of bias in all 112 studies was frequently high or unclear, however, data for this subgroup were not provided. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to suggest that CKD is a cause of death or serious adverse events in people who have CKD, and there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of dialysis for people with chronic CKD who are at high risk of dying from any cause. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies. There was no clear evidence to indicate whether CKD can be treated with dialysis, or whether there is any difference in the risk of death, serious adverse effects, or serious side effects between CKD and CKD-free dialysis. There is not enough evidence to determine whether there are any differences in the number of people who die from CKD compared to CKD with or without dialysis in terms, or if there is a difference between people with and without CKD when dialysis is used. We are uncertain about the benefits and harms of using CKD to treat CKD because the quality of evidence was very low.
Three randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1945 women were included in this review. No serious complications were reported in the trials and no neonatal or maternal deaths occurred. Overall, risk of bias across the three trials was mixed. The neonatal outcome was not statistically different between groups: Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.83; three studies, 1945); umbilical artery pH less than 7.16 (RR 2.23, 95 CI 1.95 to 1.92; one study, 239); admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) less than 48 hours after birth (RR 0.31, 95%) and admission to neonatal ICU less than 2.15 (RR 3.15) (two studies, 489; two studies, n = 489). There was no significant difference between groups in the number of women who were admitted to the NICU and those who were not. There were no serious complications reported in any of the three studies. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
We included two randomised controlled trials involving 54 participants with CVI. The intensity of disease signs and symptoms was measured in both studies but using different scales; we were therefore unable to pool the data. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas the second study reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group compared with baseline (mean difference 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4% to 6.2%). The exercise group also reported an increase in change in ejection fraction (the amount of blood pumped out of the left low chamber of the heart with each heart beat) compared with the control group. In one study, increases in changes in heart rate were not reported. In the other study, there was no difference in the number of people who had to be admitted to hospital due to heart failure. We found no evidence that exercise reduced the severity of the symptoms of CVI in either study. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of participants in the two studies and the small numbers of people included in the studies.
Seventy-six trials with a median quality score of 3 (range 1 to 5) were identified. Forty trials included comparisons of intra-articular corticosteroids (NSAIDs), three trials of hyaluronan/hylan and six trials of arthrocentesis. Follow-up period varied between day of last injection and eighteen months. There was no difference between NSAIDs and placebo in the number of people who died. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the trials. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of this review were the small number of trials and the small numbers of participants.
Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.85, CI 0.50 to 0.99) and adverse events (RR 1.03, CI 1.00 to 0). Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misopropol with placebo (a dummy medication) given in addition to conventional uterotonic treatment. Misoprostols were associated with a lower risk of serious maternal complications and a higher risk of adverse events compared to conventional treatment. However, there was no clear difference between the two groups in the number of women who died or had serious adverse events. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low.
Six randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for inclusion in this review. The majority of patients in these trials were preterm. One large multicenter RCT evaluated short-term N-acetylcysteine supplementation of cysteine-containing PN in extremely low birth weight infants (≤ 1000 grams). Growth was not significantly affected by cysteines (1 trial). Nitrogen retention was significantly increased (4 trials) or not significantly (one trial). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of growth, weight gain, or weight loss. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence was very low due to the small number of trials and the small numbers of infants included in the included trials.
We identified 77 trials including 6287 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. Forty-one trials (3829 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. Thirty-five trials (35 trials) were at low risk of bias in all domains. Overall, all the evidence was very low quality. Only one trial was at high risk of biased results in one of the domains. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of oral corticosteroids for the prevention of stroke in people with stroke. There was no evidence of a difference in the number of people who had a stroke in terms of time to death, number of strokes, length of hospital stay, or time to return to work. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low, mainly because of the small number of trials included in this review and the small numbers of participants in the included trials. We did not find any evidence of differences in the risk of death or hospital stay between the treatment groups. There were no clear differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes, such as time to recovery from stroke, time to recurrence of stroke, or length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). There was not enough evidence to determine whether there was a difference between treatment groups for any of these outcomes. We judged the quality of evidence to be low or very low for all outcomes.
In total, 1282 participants with MCI at baseline were identified in the 15 included studies of which 1172 had analysable data. The accuracy of the CSF t-tau was evaluated in seven studies (291 cases and 418 non-cases). Follow-up ranged from less than one year to over four years, but in the majority of studies was in the range one to three years for some participants. There was no difference in the number of participants who converted to Alzheimer’s disease dementia and 130 participants converted to other forms of dementia. The quality of the evidence was assessed as low to very low because of the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants included in the included studies. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of CSF for the treatment of MCI.
We found three randomised controlled trials involving 170 men undergoing radical robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III. All included participants were male and were undergoing radical surgery. We found no clinical meaningful differences in postoperative pain between the two types of anaesthetics (mean difference in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at one to six hours was -2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.62 to 6.22; P = 0.61) in a sample of 62 participants from one study). Low quality evidence suggests that there is no clinical difference in the number of patients who experienced pain at the end of surgery. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether there is a difference between the types of anesthetics in terms of side effects. The quality of the evidence was low to moderate.
We included seven new observational studies in this update, bringing the total number of studies to 14, including 5 cohort and 9 case-control studies, with 1,601,515 study subjects. Most studies found no causal association between maternal exposure to topical corticosteroids of any potency and pregnancy outcomes when compared with no exposure. These outcomes included: mode of delivery (risk ratio ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.15, 1 cohort study, n = 9904, low quality evidence); congenital abnormalities, including orofacial cleft or cleft palate and hypospadias (where the baby is born with a cleft lip or palate); and congenital malformations, including cystic fibrosis. There was no clear difference in the risk of adverse events between the two groups. The quality of the evidence ranged from low to very low.
We found four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria of this review. The total number of included participants was 611 (612 eyes), ranging from 30 to 500 participants per trial. One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study (small-scale tests of methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale if the pilot study can work) of the largest study: the Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial. The other two trials were small-scale studies. We found no evidence to support or refute the use of steroids for the treatment of corneal ulcers. However, we did find evidence to suggest that steroid use may be associated with an increase in the number of people who had to have their eyes removed due to ulceration. We did not find any evidence that steroids were associated with a reduction in the need for surgery. The evidence is current to August 2014.
We included four randomised controlled trials with a total of 450 participants. Compared with intravenous thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous vascular intervention did not improve the proportion of participants with good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2, risk ratio (RR 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.25, P = 0.92). The quality of evidence was low (outcome assessment was blinded, but not the treating physician or participants). At the end of follow-up, there was no clear difference between the groups in terms of death or functional outcome. There was no difference between groups in the number of participants who had a stroke and those who did not have a stroke. There were no clear differences in the percentage of people who were admitted to hospital for stroke-related complications. We found no evidence to support the use of blood thinning agents in the treatment of stroke patients.
We found only one randomised controlled trial, involving 120 families and 143 children. No evidence suggested that centre-based day care, rather than no treatment (care at home), improved or worsened children's cognitive ability or worsened their behaviour. We found no evidence to support the use of day care services separate from those offered within the intervention. The quality of the evidence was low, mainly because of the small number of children included in the trial and the small size of the study. We judged the quality of evidence to be very low for all outcomes.
In this review, we identified 30 scoring indices that are used to assess the quality of the evidence. We found that none of the currently available histologic scoring indices have been fully validated. The Nancy Index and the Robarts Histopathology Index have undergone the most validation in that four operating properties including reliability, content validity, construct validity and criterion validity have been tested. Two of the included scoring indices were tested for responsiveness. In order to determine the accuracy of the scoring indices, we assessed the reliability of the individual scoring indices. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated for all 11 of the indices. Intra-ratter reliability was assessed for eight of the indexing indices. Six of the 11 scoring indices explored content validity. Three of the 10 scoring indices assessed content validity and two of the 14 scoring indices examined construct validity. The four scoring indices evaluated for responsiveness were not fully validated in this review. In addition, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether any of the current scoring indices are of high quality.
We found three randomised trials that evaluated intramedullary nailing versus plating in 213 participants, with useable data from 173 participants of whom 112 were male. The mean age of participants in individual studies ranged from 41 to 44 years. There were no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment. The three included trials were at high risk of performance bias, with one trial also being at risk of selection, detection and attrition bias. There was no difference in the number of participants who had to have their teeth removed from their gums after surgery compared to those who did not have surgery. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
We included 11 studies involving a total of 38,742 participants. Eight studies compared BPLDs versus placebo or no treatment (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different systolic blood pressure targets (3632 participants). The risk of bias varied greatly between included studies. We mainly observed a reduced risk of recurrent stroke in the subgroup of participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diuretic (I2 statistic for subgroup differences 0.90; moderate-quality evidence), for major vascular event 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.06; 2 RCTs; 6671 participants) and for dementia 0.88 (95-CI 0.70 to 0.93; 8 RCTS; 35, 110 participants). We did not find any evidence of a difference between BPLD and no treatment in the risk of major vascular events or dementia. We found no evidence of any difference between the two groups in any of the other outcomes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
Five hundred nineteen men from four randomised controlled trials, (lasting 4 to 26 weeks) were assessed. Three trials used non-glucosidic B-sitosterols and one used a preparation that contained 100% B- sitosterols. B-Sitosterols improved urinary symptom scores and flow measures. The weighted mean difference (WMD) for the IPSS was -4.9 IPSS points (95% CI = -6.3 to -3.5, n = 2 studies). The WMD for peak urine flow was 3.91 mL/s and the residual volume volume was -28.62 mL. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of men who dropped out of the trials due to side effects. There were no serious side effects reported in any of the four trials. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
This review includes 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing with salbutamol. These included 62,815 participants with asthma (including 2,599 children). In six trials (2,766 patients), no serious adverse event data could be obtained. Salmeterol was more effective than placebo in reducing the risk of death and serious adverse events when compared with placebo but the increase was not significant. There was no significant difference in the number of people who died or experienced serious side effects between the two treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people with asthma who had a serious side effect. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We found two studies that compared the use of L-triiodothyronine (L-thyroxine 50 μg/day in two divided doses for two days) to no treatment in preterm infants with respiratory distress. Both studies had methodological concerns including quasi-random methods of patient allocation, no blinding of treatment or measurement and substantial post allocation losses. Neither study reported any significant benefits in neonatal morbidity or mortality from use of thyroid hormone.
We included 38 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1828 participants. Eight RCTs had a low risk of bias in the assessment of mortality and the remaining outcomes were assessed with moderate quality evidence. Random-effects meta-analysis showed a beneficial effect of non-absorbable disaccharides versus placebo/no intervention on mortality when including all RCTS with extractable data (taken out of a larger set of data and presented in a usable format) (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.87; 1487 participants; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) and in the eight studies with a low-risk of bias on mortality. We did not find any evidence of a benefit or harm in terms of the number of people who died from any cause. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to May 2016.
In this update, 65 studies (involving 3598 participants) were included in the review. Treatments included bisphosphonates, vitamin D compounds, teriparatide, denosumab, cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy, and calcitonin-related biomarkers, with more recent studies evaluating proteinuria and hyperparathyroidism. The average duration of follow-up was 12 months. The studies included in this review were conducted in the USA, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The evidence is current to January 2019. We included studies that compared the effects of bone density or bone-related markers, proteinuria, and proteinuria/hyperparathyroids in people who received bone marrow transplantation. We found that bone density was not significantly different between people receiving bone marrow transplants and those who did not receive bone transplants. There was no clear difference in the number of people who developed proteinuria or proteinuria after bone transplantation compared to people who were not receiving bone transplanted. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of the review were the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies.
Four randomised controlled trials involving 317 people met the inclusion criteria for this review. Three trials studied oral magnesium, with doses ranging from 12.5 to 20 mmol/day, and one trial studied parenteral magnesium (16.24 mEq q6h for 24 hours). One trial studied intravenous magnesium, and the fourth trial studied a combination of intravenous and oral magnesium. There was no study that measured all of the identified primary outcomes and there was a high risk of bias in at least one domain. The evidence is current to January 2015. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral magnesium for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in people with chronic kidney failure.
We included 15 randomised controlled trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure rhinosinusitis, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured after one week and 64% after 14 days of treatment with antibiotics. Overall, risk of bias was low, and the quality of the evidence was low. There was no clear difference between antibiotics and placebo in the number of people who were cured after 1 week and 14 days. There were no serious side effects reported in any of the included trials. The evidence is current to January 2013.
Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 2515 patients were included in this review. Three RCTs (all performed in Asian countries) compared D3 with D2 lymphadenectomy: data suggested no significant difference in OS between these two types of lymph node dissection, with no significant differences in postoperative mortality (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73). Data for DFS were available only from one trial and for no trial were DSS data available. Five trials (n = 3 European; n = 2 Asian) compared different types of D3 versus D2. Data suggested that there was no difference in the number of patients who died after D3 compared to D2 in terms of postoperative complications. There was no clear difference between the two groups in the length of time patients spent in intensive care unit (ICU) or in hospital. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low.
Thirteen studies, involving 1158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatment, no statistically significant difference was found for retention and abstinence, but results come only from two studies. Considering only studies were forced to adherence a statistical significant difference is found for re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84), and for psychotherapy, RR 2.93 ( 95%CI 1.66-5.18) considered.
We searched for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that assessed the effects of diet modification in people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. We included two studies that examined diet modification to fluid. Both were part of the same large multicentre trial and included people with and without dementia. Participants in the first trial were randomly assigned to a diet modification group or to a control group. The second study was conducted in the United States. Both studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). We did not find any evidence that diet modification was effective in reducing the risk of death from any cause. We found no evidence to support the use of diet modifications to improve the quality of life of participants in the second study. The quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of people included in the studies and the small size of the studies. We judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low because of the small numbers of participants and the low number of studies.
Six randomised controlled trials with a total of 788 women were included. The largest of these trials included 396 women eligible for this review. No evidence of a statistically significant difference was found between natural cycle and standard IVF in live birth rates. The evidence suggests that for a woman with a 53% chance of live birth using natural cycle, there was no difference between the two groups in the number of women who had a live birth. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low.
We included a total of 984 participants from 12 studies (23 references) in this analysis. We included only those involved in Tai Chi and the control group (i.e. 811 participants) in the final analysis. All included studies were RCTs; three studies used allocation concealment, six reported blinded outcome assessors and three studies adopted an intention-to-treat approach to statistical analysis. Study sample size ranged from 10 to 206, and mean age ranged from 61 to 74 year olds. Programmes lasted for six weeks to one year. No adverse events were reported. Quality of evidence of the outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. We found no evidence that Tai Chi was more effective than usual care or breathing exercises alone in improving quality of life. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. The evidence is current to January 2016.
We included 72 randomised controlled trials that involved 2470 participants. Study sample sizes were generally small and interventions varied in terms of both the goals of treatment, diet therapy, radiotherapy and the virtual reality devices used. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system. This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the studies included in the previous version of this review. The evidence is current to January 2016. We found that virtual reality may be effective in reducing the risk of death and disability in people with cancer. However, the quality of the evidence was low due to the small number of studies and the small numbers of participants in the included studies. There is a need for more high-quality, well-designed studies to assess the effectiveness and safety of virtual reality in the treatment of cancer.
We included five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1330 participants. None of the included trials examined regimens of less than six months duration. Fluoroquinolones were added to standard first-line treatment regimens in a single trial (174 participants) and we are uncertain if there is an effect (one trial, 174 participants, very low quality evidence) for all three outcomes (death, sputum conversion, and adverse events). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in the number of participants who relapse and treatment failure (two trials, 456 participants, high quality evidence). We were not able to determine if there was an effect of adding fluoroxacin to the standard first line of treatment for people with chronic lung disease. We were unable to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups in the proportion of people who had a relapse or treatment failure. There were no differences between the groups in any of the other outcomes. There was no difference between groups in terms of side effects. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The evidence is current to January 2016.
