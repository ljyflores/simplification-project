There are some patches of patchy airways and pleural effusions, which may be due to fluid in the lungs. The lungs have thickening of the septal wall and there is a chance that this thickening may be caused by a blood clot in the pleural space, but this is not known to be the cause of the narrowing of the airway. The stomach tube is about 2.5 cm long and the heart is about the same size as the chest tube. No aggressive osseous lesion was found, but there was a trace of pericardial effusion.

This is an overview of the condition of the heart and lungs/airways/pleura. The heart has aortic valve calcifications. The pulmonary artery is the largest artery in the lungs and the main artery of the lungs. The main artery leads to the heart. There is a narrowing in the aorta and a narrowing of the main vein. This narrowing may have been caused by a blood clot in the artery. There are no major problems with the heart or lungs. However, there is a large amount of secretions in the trachea and pleura. There may be a hole in the pulmonary artery that may lead to lung collapse. This hole may not have been there before the heart was built up. There was no evidence of a hole after surgery to the right or left of the atria. The left atrium has not yet been filled in. The right atrium drains in place. The artery that feeds the heart is not large. The other main artery is large and narrow. This artery drains in the left and should be filled in after surgery. The arterial drain should be placed in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.

The right shoulder lipoma appears to be stable, with a 4 cm diameter splenule. No aggressive bone lesions were seen. The liver is normal, but there are no signs of parenchymal lung disease.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. Lungs/airways/Pleura: No new nodules were found. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Coronary artery calcifications. Left chest wall therapy port tip terminates in the distal SVC. Upper Abdomen: Reported separately. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. No thoracic adenopathy.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. Lungs/Airways: Lungs and airways: No new lung or airway adenopathies were found. Lung disease was found in the upper lobe of the lungs, with more prominent emphysema in the lungs and more nodulars in the lung, likely due to bronchiolitis. There was no new thoracic adenopathy. Thyroid gland: The thyroid gland is still in place and has not been grown back since the thyroid was surgically removed in the 1990s. Heart and Vessels: The heart chambers appear normal in size. No pericardial effusion was found. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions were noted. Mild gynecomastia was again noted.
This is an overview of the results of the most recent study of the thoracic spine in adults. A 1 cm nodule was found in the right lower lobe of the spine on the last study. Other nodules are still there but not as large. No new or enlarging nodules have been found. Lungs/airways/Pleura: No new pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are clear. Heart and Vessels: Normal cardiac size. No pericardial effusion. Pulmonary artery is a normal size. Upper Abdomen: Upper part of the abdominal organs are unremarkable. No aggressive bone lesions. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: The right hilar node measuring up to 1.2 cm short axis in series 4 image 231 is still there and there is no new adenopathy. Thyroid: Thyroid is normal.
This is an overview of the results of the surgery to remove the lobe of the lung from the chest. Lungs/Airways/Pleura: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No new or enlarging lung nodules. No pericardial effusion. Subsegmental atelectasis of the right middle lobe. Stable 6 mm tree-in-bud nodule in the right lower lobe. No aggressive bone lesions. Heart and Vessels: Heart is normal in size. Normal course and size of the aorta. Coronary arterial artery, aortic valve and calcifications. Upper Abdomen: Left adrenal myelolipoma. Hepatic steatosis. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathies. Thyroid: Thyroid is unremarkable.
We found that the airways of the heart and lungs have not been cleared of fluid and that there are no new lung nodules. The airways are patent with no new pulmonary nodules found. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No thoracic lymphadenopathy was seen. The heart chambers are large and the aorta is of the same size as before. No new bone lesions were found. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The visualized bowel is not obstructed. There is no ascites or lymphadenitis. The vasculature is unremarkable, and no new lesions were seen. There was no new inflammation at the GE junction. The gastrostomy tube with tip and balloon is still in place.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. The heart is stably enlarged. No new or enlarged pulmonary nodules were found. No pericardial effusion was noted in the aorta. There is a large right pleural effusion, but this is not thought to be related to the heart. There are no new or enlarging lung nodules. Thyroid gland enlargement was reported in both the paratracheal and the upper lobe of the thyroid. There were no new lymph nodes in either lobe. No aggressive bone lesions were noted. The patient is in hospital.
This is an overview of the results from the review of post-mastectomy surgery for breast cancer. The breast is the largest breast in the upper arm and has the largest volume of breast tissue. The right breast has the smallest volume. The left breast has a large volume of the breast and the right breast only has a small volume of tissue. Both breasts have thinning of the bronchial wall (bronchial thickening) in the right lung. There is some thinning in the left lung as well. The heart and vessels appear to be normal in size. No pericardial effusion. No thoracic adenopathy.
We found that the lungs and airways of the heart were normal in size and that the aortic valves were still intact. There was no evidence of fluid in the pleural spaces. There were no changes in the thoracic spine. The heart had a normal course and size of the vessels. The aorta had calcification of the valve that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. The lymph nodes in the heart and in the abdomen were not large or large.
This is an overview of the findings from the review. Lungs/Airways: Lungs: There are no new or enlarging nodules. Mild bronchiectasis in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart and Vessels: The heart appears normal in size. There is aortic and coronary artery calcification. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and size of the aorta. Upper Abdomen: Unremarkable. Osseous and soft tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. Mediastinum/Lymph nodes: No thoracic adenopathy. Thyroid enlargement is not known to be a cause for concern. The thyroid appears to be normal size.
