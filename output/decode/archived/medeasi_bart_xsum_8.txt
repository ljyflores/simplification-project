This review found that a drug called desmopressin, which is an analog of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) (antidotrophins), stimulates the release of VWF into the plasma and may increase levels of factor VIII. Desmopressins may be helpful for patients with type 1 and some variants of type 2 VWD. Desiopressin is ineffective in other variants of VWD, and in type 2A can worsen thrombocytopenia (a condition in which blood clots form in the legs and feet). To ensure adequate response to the drug, physicians give patients a test dose and measure the response of VWFs. Desopressins given in a saline solution given over 15 to 30 minutes may enable patients to undergo minor procedures (eg, tooth extraction, minor surgery) without needing replacement therapy. For many patients, intra- nasal desmopressein may be as effective as IV treatment and is often useful to prevent bleeding during minor surgical procedures.
