The review authors searched the medical literature and found that there were no new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. However, there were a few granulomas in the right lower lobe of the lungs. The review authors found that the right lung was still clogged and the right upper lobe was still filled with fluid. The left lung was also clogged, but this was likely due to the presence of a foreign body in the left lower lobe. The right upper lung was not clogged or filled. No pleural effusions were noted.

There is a persistent obstruction of the right lung and the right pleural effusion is worse than before. There are new soft tissue deposits along the right middle lobe and lower lobe bronchovascular bundles and nodular interlobular septal thickening, consistent with the lymphangitic spread of the tumor.

The review of trials found that there is a lot of evidence to support the theory that the right lung is more likely to expand than the left. However, the evidence is not strong enough to support this. The review also found that the left lung is probably more likely than the right to expand, but this is probably due to the fact that it is more exposed to the elements of the body. There is also some evidence that there may be a lot more evidence that the lung is expanding in the right side of the chest. There are no new lung nodules in the left upper lobe, but previously new nodules noted on July 2021 examination have resolved. There was no evidence of any new growth of new nodes in the lymph nodes. There were no new bone lesions in the lower lung. The left lung has a small but stable left apex micronodule (5:75) and the right pleural effusion has resolved. The right lung base and left lower lobe have a stable left ventricular micronoidule (6:199, 236). There is no evidence that this is related to airways disease.
