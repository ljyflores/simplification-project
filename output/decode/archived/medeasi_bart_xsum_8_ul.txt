Diagnosis of the cause of DiGeorge syndrome is based on clinical findings. An absolute lymphocyte count is done, followed by B-cell and T-cell counts, and the use of lymphocyte subsets if leukopoietic leukopenia (a type of leukocytosis). If the leukomegoid lymphocyte subtype (the'sham' lymphocyte), is not found, blood tests to assess the lymphocyte and paratheroid function are done. Ig levels and vaccine titers are measured.
