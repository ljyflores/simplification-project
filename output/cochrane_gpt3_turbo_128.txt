This is a study about how teaching kids and their parents about asthma can help them stay healthier. They looked at 38 different studies with 7,843 kids. After the kids and parents learned about asthma, they had fewer emergency room visits and hospital stays. They also went to the doctor less often. But they don't know if this helps with other things like how well their lungs work or how they feel. They also don't know the best way to teach about asthma to make it work the best.
We looked at 130 studies with 8341 people who had different types of surgeries. Some people were given a medicine called ketamine and some were not. We found that the people who got ketamine needed less pain medicine and had less pain after surgery. They also had less nausea and vomiting. Ketamine did not cause many bad side effects.
Scientists tested a vaccine called MSP/RESA on 217 people in five different tests. They found that the vaccine was safe and didn't cause any bad side effects. In one test, they gave the vaccine to 17 people who didn't have immunity to malaria, but it didn't seem to help them. In another test, they gave the vaccine to 120 kids in Papua New Guinea. It didn't stop them from getting sick, but it did help reduce the number of parasites in their blood. The vaccine only worked on one type of parasite, called MSP2. The scientists think this vaccine could be helpful in the future,
Some people did four studies to see if using special electric fields could help bones heal. They looked at 125 people who had broken bones that were not healing well. The studies were done in a way that was fair and unbiased, but they still had some problems. They measured how many people's bones had healed after a certain amount of time. They found that the electric fields did not make a big difference in helping the bones heal. Some people still had pain and there were some small problems from the treatment. The studies did not look at how well people could use their bones after they healed. The people who did the studies think that more
This is a study about people who had surgery to remove their gallbladder. Some of them had a tube called a drain put in after surgery, and some did not. The study looked at things like how many people got sick or died after surgery, how long they stayed in the hospital, and how long it took them to recover. The study found that there was no big difference between the two groups, but more research is needed to be sure.
This is a study about using herbal medicines to help people with a problem called diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The study looked at 49 different tests that were done in China with 3639 people. They tried 38 different herbal medicines, including some made from just one plant and some made from a mix of plants. The tests looked at whether the medicines helped people feel better and if they caused any bad side effects. The results of the tests were not very good because they were not done very well. Some of the tests did not even say if there were any bad side effects. So, we can't really say if these herbal medicines are
This is a review of five studies about treating advanced prostate cancer. The studies had small groups of people and were short. They looked at two different treatments called IAS and CAS. One study found that IAS was better for patients with a certain score. Both treatments had similar side effects, but IAS had less impotence. We don't know which treatment is better for overall survival or disease progression. IAS was better for potency during the treatment cycles.
We looked at 12 studies with 7,119 people who were randomly chosen to get an IUD right away or later. Some studies showed that getting the IUD right away made it more likely to fall out or be taken out, but other studies showed it was safer to get it right away. Some types of IUDs were better than others at preventing pregnancy and staying in place. Getting an IUD right after having an abortion is safe and works well, but it might be more likely to fall out right away. After six months, people who got the IUD right away were more likely to still be using it.
We looked at a small study about how meditation can help people with a type of cancer called acute leukaemia. 91 people joined the study, but only 42 stayed for the whole six months. We don't know how old the people were or how many were boys or girls. Because we didn't have all the information, we can't be sure if the study was fair. We think more studies are needed to know if meditation can help people with this type of cancer. The study did show that people who meditated had better quality of life and felt less sad than people who didn't meditate. But we don't know
We looked at three different tests that involved 110 healthy kids who were brothers or sisters of people who were sick. The tests were different in how they were done and what they looked at, so we couldn't combine the results. Two of the tests might not have been done very well. Out of the kids who got the vaccine, only 13 out of 56 got sick with chickenpox, while 42 out of 54 kids who didn't get the vaccine got sick. Most of the kids who got sick only had a little bit of chickenpox. The vaccine worked best when it was given within three days of being
We looked at 12 studies with 4704 people to see if taking antibiotics before surgery can help prevent infections. Most of the studies compared different types of antibiotics, but one compared taking antibiotics to not taking them. We found that there was not enough information to combine the results of all the studies. We also found that there were no serious side effects from taking antibiotics, but we don't know if taking antibiotics helps people feel better or stay in the hospital for less time. Overall, about 5.5% of people got infections after surgery, but only 1% of those infections were caused by a specific type of bacteria called MR
We looked at two groups of women (116 in total) who had their babies early. One group stayed at home and the other group went to the hospital. We found that there were not enough women in each group to know for sure which way was better. We did see that the women who stayed at home were happier with their care and spent less time in the hospital. It also cost less money. We need to do more studies with more women to know for sure which way is better. We should also look at how happy the moms are and how much it costs.
When a baby is born through a caesarean, doctors have two ways to close the skin. One way is with staples that don't go away on their own, and the other way is with stitches that do go away. Both ways have similar chances of the cut getting infected. But, staples might make the skin come apart more often than stitches, and might need to be fixed again. It's not clear which way is better, but doctors usually use staples or stitches. If staples are used, they might need to be fixed again after three days.
We looked at 11 studies with 821 people to see if drinking green or black tea can help prevent heart problems. Seven studies looked at green tea and four looked at black tea. The amount and type of tea was different in each study. One study is still going on and is looking at green tea powder capsules. None of the studies reported any heart problems. Black tea was found to lower bad cholesterol and blood pressure, but only a few studies looked at this and they may not be completely accurate. Green tea was also found to lower bad cholesterol and blood pressure, but again, only a few studies looked at this and the results may
There were two small studies with 23 people that were looked at. Some of the people might have had lung problems. They didn't say if anyone took medicine by mouth. The studies didn't show any big differences in how well people could breathe or how they felt. One study showed a small difference, but we don't know if it's important. The studies weren't done perfectly, so we can't say for sure if the medicine they looked at is good for people with asthma. They didn't find any new studies when they looked again in 2010. We need bigger and better studies before we can say if this medicine is
We looked at 56 studies with over 4000 people who had breast cancer or other types of cancer. We found that doing exercise helped people feel less tired. We looked at different types of exercise and found that aerobic exercise, like running or biking, was the most helpful. We need to do more research to figure out the best way to exercise for people with cancer. But for now, we know that doing aerobic exercise can help people with cancer feel less tired.
We looked at a lot of information and found five studies that included only adults between 16 and 65 years old. We found that using a treatment called BEACOPP escalated helped people with a type of cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma live longer and have less chance of the cancer coming back. However, this treatment may cause more side effects like infections and low blood counts. We are not sure if it affects fertility or causes other types of cancer in the long term. We need more research to know for sure.
This is a study about how to help people with cancer go back to work. The study looked at different ways to help, like teaching patients about self-care, physical training, and counseling. They found that a combination of different types of help, like physical and emotional support, helped people go back to work more than just regular care. They also found that less intense medical treatments were just as good as more intense ones for helping people go back to work. Overall, the study found that getting different types of help can make it easier for people with cancer to go back to work.
We looked at some studies about how doctors check babies' heartbeats when their moms are having babies. We found that using a machine to check the heartbeat when the mom first comes to the hospital doesn't help the baby and might even make it more likely that the mom will need surgery to have the baby. We looked at four studies with over 13,000 women in the UK and Ireland. Three of the studies were paid for by hospitals and one was paid for by the Scottish government. Two of the studies didn't say if anyone involved had a conflict of interest. The studies were pretty good quality. The results were the same as
We looked at 32 studies about how to help women get pregnant using IVF or ICSI. Some studies looked at women, some at cycles, and some at eggs. We couldn't combine the data because each study used different things to help the embryos grow. Only seven studies reported on whether the women had a baby or were still pregnant. Four of those studies found no difference between the things they used to help the embryos grow. One study found that one thing helped more than another, but we're not sure if that study was done well. Some studies reported on bad things that can happen, like having more than one baby or losing
The people who wrote this article looked at a lot of papers about how doctors tell women they have breast cancer. They found 27 papers that were not copies and could be used for their research. But none of these papers were good enough to use. They couldn't find any studies that tested different ways of telling women they have breast cancer. They think it might not be fair to test this because it's a really hard time for women. They suggest doing a study on how doctors talk to women during their first visit instead.
We looked at 17 studies with over 1000 people who had chest pain. We found that a type of therapy called psychological intervention helped reduce chest pain for the first three months after the therapy. This therapy also helped people have more days without chest pain. However, the therapy did not seem to help with chest pain severity or frequency after three months. Some studies had issues with how they were done, so we need more studies to be sure. Overall, psychological therapy can help with chest pain, but we need more research to know for sure.
We looked at 30 different tests that involved 4344 people trying out 17 different medicines for allergies. We found that some medicines worked better than others, but we need more information to know for sure. Most of the tests only lasted a few weeks, so we don't know if the medicines work for a long time. We did find that the medicines were safe and didn't cause any bad side effects.
This is a report about studies that looked at ways to help Native American kids stop using tobacco. Two studies were included and one was still going on. The studies used different ways to help kids in their communities. One study found that there was no difference in smoking between the group that got help and the group that didn't. Another study found that there was a difference in smokeless tobacco use between the group that got help and the group that didn't, but it didn't last very long. Both studies had some problems with how they were done. The report says that we need more studies to find out how to help Native American kids stop
We looked at six reports about sickle cell anemia in women. We found one report that had 72 women with sickle cell anemia. We are not sure if the report was fair. The report said that no women died during or after giving birth. We are not sure if there were any big differences between the women who got blood transfusions before giving birth and the women who got blood transfusions only if they needed it. The report said that getting blood transfusions before giving birth might help with pain, but we are not sure. We do not know if getting blood transfusions before giving birth is better than getting blood transf
We looked at 67 different tests that involved 6197 people. All of the tests were not very fair. We found that only one test showed a difference in the number of bad things that happened. This test used a tool called a radiofrequency dissecting sealer, and it caused more bad things to happen than another tool called the clamp-crush method. We also found some other small differences in tests, like how much blood people needed or how long they stayed in the hospital. But most of the tests did not show any differences. We cannot say for sure if one tool is better than another because we did not have enough information
This is a study about different ways to treat a skin condition called PPP. They looked at 23 different tests with 724 people. They found that some treatments, like systemic retinoids and oral PUVA, can help. But using a combination of treatments is even better. They also found that using a topical steroid under a special bandage can be helpful. Some other treatments, like colchicine and topical PUVA, may not work as well or have side effects. But there is no one perfect treatment for PPP yet. The study shows that doctors need to do better research to find the best treatments for patients.
Scientists studied five different medicines that can help lower blood pressure. They tested these medicines on 460 people who had high blood pressure for almost 9 weeks. They found that the medicines helped lower blood pressure by about 8 points for the top number and 4 points for the bottom number. They did not find any big differences between the different medicines. However, they did not study the side effects of the medicines very well.
We looked at 58 experiments where doctors gave medicine to people having surgery on their gallbladder. Most of the people in the experiments were not at high risk for problems with the medicine. The doctors used different kinds of medicine and gave it in different ways. We found that the medicine helped with pain after surgery, but we don't know if it made a big difference. We need more experiments to be sure.
We looked at 74 different studies about a test for a sickness called malaria. The test looks for things called antigens in the blood. There are two types of antigens, HRP-2 and pLDH. The test can find the antigens by themselves or with other things. We compared the test to another way of checking for malaria called microscopy. We found that the test is pretty good at finding malaria. The HRP-2 test is better at finding malaria, but it can also make mistakes and say someone has malaria when they don't. The pLDH test is not as good at finding malaria, but it
We looked at five studies from the UK that tested if making doctor appointments longer would help patients. We found that the studies were not very reliable because they did not have enough information and were too small. We are not sure if making appointments longer will help patients with things like getting more medicine or feeling better. We need more studies to know for sure.
Scientists looked at a lot of information to see if taking a high or low dose of a medicine called stavudine was better for people who already take medicine for HIV. They found three studies that met their requirements. All three studies were done in rich countries and had people who had been taking medicine for HIV for a while and had low levels of the virus. They found that there was no big difference in how well the medicine worked between the high and low doses. Some people had side effects like high levels of fat in their blood or weaker bones, but no one had to stop taking the medicine because of these side effects. The studies were
This is a report about ten different tests that were done on 1658 people. Five of the tests were done really well, and five were done okay. Six of the tests used a special way of helping people breathe that was different from the regular way. Six of the tests looked at whether people lived or died. The results showed that using the special way of helping people breathe made it more likely that people would survive in the hospital, but it didn't make a difference in whether they lived for 28 days or in the long run. It also didn't make it more likely for them to have a problem with their lungs. However
This is a report about 15 studies that looked at how different treatments affect people with asthma. The studies had a total of 687 people, but some of them were not very good quality. Some of the treatments seemed to help a little bit, like relaxation therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. But other treatments didn't seem to make a difference. The studies were all different, so it's hard to say for sure which treatments are best for asthma. We need more studies to find out which treatments work best.
This is a review of 35 studies that looked at how well antidepressants and benzodiazepines work for people with panic disorder. The studies had a total of 6,785 people, but only a few of them gave information about the main things the researchers were interested in. The evidence suggests that there is not much difference between antidepressants and benzodiazepines in terms of how well they work. However, benzodiazepines may be better than antidepressants at preventing people from dropping out of the study. The studies also showed that some antidepressants are better tolerated than others. The studies were not perfect, and
This is a study about different ways to help people with a sickness called pancreatic carcinoma. The study looked at 29 different tests with over 1,700 people. Some tests used plastic tubes to help, and some used surgery. The plastic tubes were better for reducing problems, but they were more likely to get blocked again before the person died. Metal tubes were better than plastic tubes for not getting blocked again, but they didn't make a big difference in other problems or if the person died within 30 days. One type of plastic tube was better than others, and adding a special valve to some tubes helped them work better. Right now
We looked at five studies that tested how to put a tube into a child's artery. Four studies compared using a machine that shows pictures (ultrasound) to using your hands to feel for the artery (palpation), and one study compared ultrasound to using a machine that makes noise (Doppler). Some studies didn't give enough information, so we're not sure how good they were. It was hard for the doctors to not know which method they were using in all the studies. We found that using ultrasound was better than the other methods because it had a higher success rate and fewer problems like bruises. This was especially true for
Some people did some studies to see if watching movies or commercials with alcohol in them makes people drink more. They found that young men who watched movies with less alcohol in them drank less than those who watched movies with more alcohol in them. They also found that young men who watched commercials that didn't have alcohol in them drank less than those who watched commercials that did have alcohol in them. However, the studies were not very good quality and there were some problems with them. They also looked at some studies about banning alcohol advertising and found that the results were not consistent. They think more research needs to be done to figure out if banning alcohol advertising
This text talks about some studies that were done on baby formula. They looked at different types of formula and how they affected babies' growth and health. They found that there wasn't much difference between the formulas in terms of how much babies grew or how healthy they were. However, they say that more studies are needed to be sure about this.
We looked at a small study with 34 people to see if putting liquid into the uterus during labor helps prevent infections. The study was not very good because it didn't have enough people and didn't give enough information. We found that putting liquid in did not make a big difference in preventing infections or helping babies. We need more studies with more people to know for sure if this is a good idea.
There were three studies that looked at a test called the Mini-Cog. A total of 1620 people took the test. The studies showed that the Mini-Cog is pretty good at finding people who have problems with their memory. But, the studies were different from each other and had some problems, so it's hard to say for sure if the Mini-Cog is the best test to use. We need more studies to compare the Mini-Cog to other tests and see if it's really helpful for finding memory problems in people who live in the community.
We looked at 19 studies that tested three types of medicine called amphetamines. These studies had 2521 people in them, mostly middle-aged men with ADHD. The studies were done in the USA and Canada. The medicine helped reduce ADHD symptoms, but it did not help people stay in treatment. Some people had to stop taking the medicine because of side effects. Different doses and types of the medicine did not make a big difference. We did not find evidence that amphetamines were better than other medicines for ADHD. However, the studies we looked at were short and had some problems, so we need more research to be sure.
We looked at 10 studies with 811 people to see if taking vitamin D helps with chronic pain. Some studies gave different amounts of vitamin D and looked at different types of pain. Only two studies showed that vitamin D helped with pain. We didn't find enough evidence to say that vitamin D is better than a fake pill for chronic pain. Not many people had side effects from taking vitamin D. We need more studies to see if vitamin D can help with certain types of chronic pain.
This text talks about a lot of studies that looked at how to help people with diabetes. They looked at over 200 different ways to help, with more than 48,000 patients. Some of the ways they tried to help were by teaching doctors and nurses how to do things better, and by making changes to how healthcare is organized. They also tried to teach patients more about how to take care of themselves. They found that when they used a lot of different ways to help, it worked better than just one way. They also found that when nurses helped patients learn more about their health, it made a big difference.
This is a study about different types of birth control. They looked at five different studies that included 1503 women. The studies compared different types of birth control like pills, patches, rings, and devices that go inside the body. They found that most of the methods worked well and were used by many women for a long time. The only difference they found was that some women stopped using the pill more often than the device that goes inside the body. They also found that they didn't have enough information to compare birth control for young women.
This text talks about a study that looked at how well a treatment called immunotherapy works for people with allergies. They looked at 88 different tests, and found that immunotherapy helped reduce asthma symptoms and the need for medication. It also helped with a problem called bronchial hyper-reactivity. However, some people had bad reactions to the treatment, so doctors need to be careful when using it. Overall, the study found that immunotherapy can be helpful for people with allergies, but it's important to be cautious.
We looked for new studies, but we didn't find any. We still have six studies with 1297 patients. Five of them were good, but one was not so good. Using a special way of helping people breathe called "lung-protective ventilation" helped reduce the number of people who died in the hospital. But we don't know if it helps with other problems or in the long-term. It's hard to understand the results because the studies were different. Using this special way of breathing is becoming more common, so it's hard to do more studies.
We looked at 15 studies with 1833 people to see which type of medicine works best for waking up after surgery. We found that none of the studies were very good. Two studies showed that one medicine called isoflurane made people take longer to wake up than another medicine called propofol. Four studies showed that another medicine called sevoflurane did not make people take longer to wake up than propofol. We also found that propofol caused less nausea and vomiting than sevoflurane or isoflurane, but it caused more changes in blood pressure. We found that
This text talks about a study that looked at how treating high blood pressure in older people affects their memory and thinking. The study looked at four different groups of people with high blood pressure who were around 75 years old. The study found that treating high blood pressure did not make a big difference in preventing memory problems or dementia. However, treating high blood pressure did lower people's blood pressure levels. Some people had to stop taking the medicine because of side effects, but this happened about the same amount in both the group taking the medicine and the group taking a fake medicine. The study had some problems because some people in the group not taking the
We looked at 12 different studies with 3474 patients to see if a certain treatment called PTCRA was helpful. We found that it didn't really help patients with simple problems, but for more complicated problems, it didn't make things worse, but it also didn't make things better. PTCRA can sometimes cause problems like spasms, holes, and blockages in the blood vessels. It might be helpful for some patients who can't have surgery or who have really complicated problems, but we need more information to be sure.
This is a study about a medicine called nebulised rhDNase that was given to kids under 2 years old who were in the hospital with a sickness called bronchiolitis. The study looked at three different groups of kids who got the medicine or a fake medicine. The study found that the medicine did not help the kids get better faster or have less time in the hospital. Some kids who got the medicine had a problem called atelectasis, but two of them got better after getting the medicine. The study says that more research needs to be done to see if this medicine can help kids with severe bronchiolitis.
This is a report about two different ways doctors can fix a problem with a blood vessel in the leg. One way is called "percutaneous" and the other way is called "cut-down femoral artery access." The report looked at two studies with a total of 181 people who had one of these procedures. One study was better than the other because it had more people and was done better. The report found that both ways of fixing the blood vessel were about the same in terms of how well they worked and how safe they were. The percutaneous way was faster, but there were not enough studies to be sure. The
In two tests, they compared a sponge and a diaphragm to see which one was better at preventing pregnancy. The diaphragm worked better in both tests. In the bigger test in the USA, 17 out of 100 women using the sponge got pregnant in a year, while only 12 out of 100 women using the diaphragm got pregnant. In the UK test, 24 out of 100 women using the sponge got pregnant in a year, while only 10 out of 100 women using the diaphragm got pregnant. More people stopped using the sponge after a year because they didn't like it.
Scientists looked at 16 studies to see if they could find ways to help people who have trouble thinking because of brain problems. They found 6 studies that were helpful. Three studies looked at ways to stop the problem from happening and three studies looked at ways to make the problem better. They couldn't combine all the studies because they were too different. Two studies looked at medicine to help stop the problem. One medicine helped people think better overall, but didn't help with memory. The other medicine didn't seem to help much. Another study looked at a program to help people think better, but they didn't compare it to anything else.
This is a review of two studies that looked at how well a type of laser treatment worked for people who had an injury to their mouth. The studies had some problems, like not enough people being in them and not reporting everything they found. The studies showed that the laser treatment might help improve feeling in the lip and chin areas, but we need more studies to be sure. The studies didn't look at other things like pain or how well people could eat or talk. We need more studies to find out what works best for people with mouth injuries.
This is a study about using medicine to prevent miscarriages. Two groups of pregnant women were studied, one group had diabetes and the other group had in-vitro fertilization. The study found that using the medicine did not make a big difference in preventing miscarriages or premature births. However, using the medicine did increase the risk of cancer in the reproductive system for the mothers. The study did not have enough information to say for sure if the medicine works or not, so more research is needed.
This is a study about medicine for people who feel sad a lot. The study looked at 14 different tests with 1364 people taking medicine and 919 people taking a fake medicine. Most of the tests were only 6-8 weeks long. The study found that two types of medicine, called TCAs and SSRIs, were helpful for people who feel sad a lot. The TCAs helped a little bit more than the SSRIs. The medicine helped between 7 and 16 out of every 100 people who took it. Some people had to stop taking the medicine because of side effects, but this didn't happen very
This is a report about a medicine called ibuprofen that can help people who have really bad headaches called migraines. The report looked at nine studies with over 4,000 people who had migraines. They compared ibuprofen to a fake medicine called a placebo or other medicines that help with pain. They found that ibuprofen can help with the pain of migraines, but not everyone gets complete relief. The higher dose of ibuprofen (400 mg) worked better than the lower dose (200 mg) for most people. A special kind of ibuprofen that dissolves in water works faster than regular tablets. People
We looked at 43 different studies that tested different eye drops for dry eyes. Because the studies were all different, we couldn't combine the results to make one big conclusion. We found that some eye drops worked better than others, but we need more research to be sure. We also found that most eye drops are safe, but some people might have side effects. We need more studies to be sure which eye drops work the best.
This text talks about different treatments for people with HIV. Some studies looked at whether a certain medicine called lamivudine helped or not, but they found that it didn't make a difference. Other studies looked at different medicines and found that they worked well for some people. However, there is still more research needed to find the best treatment for everyone. The doctors make recommendations based on what they know so far and what is available.
We looked at a lot of studies about how to tell if it will be hard to help someone breathe during surgery. We tested seven different ways to check, and found that some were better than others. The upper lip bite test was the best one. But, all of the tests we tried were not very good at finding out if it will be hard to help someone breathe. We need to do more research to find better ways to check.
Scientists looked at 63 studies with over 8000 people to see if probiotics can help with diarrhea. Most of the studies were done with babies and young kids. The studies were different in many ways, like how they defined diarrhea and how sick the people were. But, they found that probiotics can help make diarrhea go away faster. The size of the effect varied between studies, but overall, probiotics helped reduce how long people had diarrhea and how often they went to the bathroom. Probiotics did not cause any bad side effects. They worked well with other treatments for diarrhea. However, more research is needed to know which
We looked at one study that compared a new type of therapy called nidotherapy with regular therapy. The study had 52 people and lasted for 18 months. The study looked at how well people did in the short term (up to 6 months) and medium term (between 6 and 12 months) with the new therapy compared to regular therapy. The results showed that the new therapy helped people with their social skills and using non-hospital services better than regular therapy in the short and medium term, but the results were not strong enough to be sure. The study also showed that people who got the new therapy were less likely to
We looked at some studies about a medicine called pregabalin for people with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes a lot of pain. We found that pregabalin can help reduce the pain for some people. We looked at eight studies with over 3,000 people. In five of the studies, people were given either pregabalin or a fake medicine (placebo) for 8 to 13 weeks. We found that more people who took pregabalin had less pain than those who took the fake medicine. Pregabalin can also cause some side effects like dizziness and weight gain
We looked at one study with 135 women who had a mild problem during pregnancy. They were given either a medicine called magnesium sulphate or a fake medicine. The study found that there was no big difference between the two groups in how the babies did after they were born or when they were born. But the women who got the real medicine had more side effects like feeling warm and flushed. We need more studies to know if this medicine is safe and helpful for babies who are born at full term. We also need to find ways to make sure the medicine doesn't cause too many side effects for the moms.
This text talks about studies that looked at ways to help people stop smoking. Some studies used medicine and talking therapy, while others used talking therapy alone. The studies showed that these methods can help people quit smoking, but there is not enough evidence to know for sure. The studies also showed that Indigenous people, who are a minority group, have more health problems related to smoking. We need more studies to find better ways to help Indigenous people and others quit smoking.
We looked at 13 studies with over 5,000 patients. Some of the studies were not done very well, but we still included them because they didn't have a big impact on our overall findings. Most of the studies were good and didn't have any problems. All of the studies looked at how many people died in the hospital or in the ICU. We separated the studies into two groups: one for people who had risky surgeries and one for people who were in the ICU for other reasons. We found that using a tool called PAC didn't make a big difference in how many people died or how long they stayed in the hospital
This text talks about how doctors take blood from babies. They looked at six studies with 478 babies. They found that when doctors took blood from a baby's vein, it hurt less than when they pricked the baby's heel. They also found that giving the baby something sweet to taste before the procedure helped reduce the pain. When doctors took blood from the vein, they didn't have to try as many times as when they pricked the heel. This is a good way to take blood from babies, but more studies should be done to make sure it's safe and works well.
This text talks about two small studies that looked at how to help women who had a cut in their private area after having a baby. One study showed that some women who had the cut sewn up again healed a little faster, but it wasn't a big difference. Another study showed that there wasn't much difference in pain or how soon women were able to have sex again between those who had the cut sewn up again and those who didn't. The studies didn't look at other things like how much pain the women had or how happy they were with how it looked. The studies didn't give enough information to say if sewing up
We looked at 18 studies with 2521 people. Most of the studies were not very good. They compared different herbs and drugs to see which ones worked best for the flu. Only three studies showed that some herbs worked better than drugs. One study found that 'Ganmao' capsules worked better than a drug called amantadine. Some people had mild side effects from the herbs and drugs. Most of the herbs worked about the same as the drugs. We need more studies to be sure which ones work best.
We looked at 8 studies with 580 people to see what works best when a tube in your body (called a catheter) stops working during dialysis. Some studies used medicine to dissolve the blockage, while others used special tools to remove it. We found that both methods work well, but there isn't enough evidence to say which one is better. The studies were not perfect and some had problems, like not enough people in the study or being influenced by drug companies. More research is needed to figure out the best way to fix a blocked catheter during dialysis.
We looked at 17 studies that tested different treatments for breast cancer. In total, 2674 patients were tested. Some studies looked at how well the treatment worked to shrink the tumor, and others looked at how long the patients lived. We found that adding a drug to the treatment helped shrink the tumor more often, but it also caused more side effects like hair loss, nausea, and low white blood cell count. However, adding the drug did not make a big difference in how long the patients lived or how long it took for the cancer to get worse.
Ten studies looked at almost 1900 patients who were treated in a special unit called a NLU. The studies found that patients who went to the NLU did not have a higher chance of dying while in the hospital or after they left. Patients who went to the NLU were less likely to go to another place to get care after they left the hospital and were better able to do things on their own when they left. However, they stayed in the hospital a little longer. One study compared the NLU to the ICU and found that they were about the same in terms of how long patients stayed and how many died. Going to
We looked at 11 studies with 414 people to see if using ultrasound helps with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Some studies compared ultrasound to fake treatment, some compared different types of ultrasound, and some compared ultrasound to other treatments like exercises or splints. Some studies were good, but others were not so good. Overall, we don't have enough evidence to say if one type of ultrasound is better than another or if ultrasound is better than other treatments. Some studies showed that ultrasound might help with short-term improvement, but we need more studies to be sure. We also need more studies to make sure ultrasound is safe.
We looked at eight studies with about 10,000 people. They took different medicines to help prevent strokes. We found that one medicine called a statin can help reduce the chance of having another stroke if you already had one before. But it doesn't seem to help with other problems like sudden death. Three studies showed that statins can help prevent serious problems with your blood vessels. If you had a stroke before, taking a statin can help prevent heart problems, but it might not help prevent another stroke. We're not sure if you should start taking statins right after a stroke or wait. But if you had heart problems before
This is a report about eleven different campaigns that tried to get people to stop smoking. The studies were different in many ways, like how long they lasted and how they measured smoking behavior. Some of the campaigns were more successful than others. Two campaigns in California and Massachusetts were very successful in getting people to smoke less. Three other campaigns also had some success. Overall, the report shows that campaigns that use TV and other media can help people stop smoking, but it's hard to say for sure because the studies were all different. One campaign in Massachusetts was successful for eight years after it ended. In some communities, campaigns also had some success.
We looked at 24 studies with 2166 people. 23 of those studies gave us information we could use. Some studies were better than others at picking people to be in the study, making sure the people doing the study didn't know which group they were in, and keeping people in the study until the end. We found that doing yoga can make you feel better and sleep better in the short term. It can also help you feel less tired. But it doesn't seem to help with feeling sad or worried in the short term. When we compared yoga to other ways of helping people feel better, like talking to someone or learning
This is a study about people who had surgery for a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma. The study looked at whether it was helpful to take pictures of the brain right after surgery or not. The study found that taking pictures right after surgery did not seem to make a big difference in how long people lived. However, more research is needed to know for sure. The doctors also did not find any other schedules for taking pictures that were better. They suggest doing more research to figure out the best time to take pictures of the brain for different types of brain cancer.
We looked at three studies that involved 161 people with schizophrenia. We only had information for two of the seven things we wanted to study. We used a test called the Clinical Global Impression to see if people got better. We found that there was no big difference between the two groups of people who took different medicines. We also found that the number of people who had a problem called parkinsonism was about the same in both groups. We didn't have enough information to see if the medicines helped with other things like mental health, going back to the hospital, liking the treatment, being mean or violent, or how much it cost.
Scientists looked at 23 studies to see what treatments work best for people with Crohn's disease after surgery. They found that some medicines, like nitroimidazole antibiotics, mesalamine, and azathioprine/6MP, can help prevent the disease from coming back. But these medicines can also have side effects, so doctors need to think carefully about which one to use. Other medicines, like infliximab, budesonide, tenovil, and interleukin-10, need more research to see if they work well.
We looked at seven different studies with 825 people to see if different ways of talking to people could help them drink less alcohol. We found that most of the studies were not very good, so we can't be sure if any of the talking methods worked better than others. We did find that one type of talking, called brief motivational intervention, helped some people drink less. But we need more studies to be sure.
We looked at 23 studies with 1586 people to see if quinine helps with muscle cramps. Most of the people in the studies were from unpublished studies. Quinine was compared to other things like vitamin E and placebo. The most common dose of quinine was 300 mg/day. We found that quinine can help reduce the number and intensity of muscle cramps, but it can also cause some minor side effects like stomach problems. Overdosing on quinine can be dangerous, but we didn't find any major side effects in the studies we looked at. We also found that combining quinine with theophylline
We looked at seven different tests with 406 people. Some people were in more than one test. Three tests were for women who had leg cramps during pregnancy, and four tests were for people who had leg cramps for no clear reason. We compared magnesium to either a fake pill or no treatment. For the people who had leg cramps for no clear reason, taking magnesium did not make a big difference in how often they had cramps or how bad they were. We don't know if magnesium helps with leg cramps during pregnancy or other types of leg cramps. Magnesium did not cause more side effects than the fake pill
This study looked at how exercise affects people with a condition called SMA. They had 14 people between the ages of 10 and 48 do exercises at home for six months. Some did strength training and some did bike riding. They compared these people to a group that didn't exercise. They found that the exercise didn't make a big difference in how far people could walk or how well they could breathe. It did help a little with muscle strength, but not with feeling tired or quality of life. The study wasn't perfect, so we can't be sure if exercise is good or bad for people with SMA. We need more studies
There were two small studies done to see if surgery or other treatments were better for neck problems. One study found that surgery helped more than physiotherapy or wearing a neck brace in the short-term, but after a year there was no big difference. The other study found that surgery and other treatments were about the same in helping people with mild neck problems over three years. However, both studies had problems and may not be completely accurate. More research is needed to know for sure if surgery is better than other treatments in the long-term.
We looked at nine studies about talking to a doctor or nurse on the phone instead of going to see them in person. Some studies compared talking to a doctor or nurse on the phone to normal care. Others compared talking to different types of healthcare workers on the phone. Some studies found that talking on the phone reduced the number of times people went to see a doctor in person. But some studies found that people talked on the phone and then had to go see a doctor in person more often. About half of the calls were just advice on the phone. Some studies looked at how many times people went to the emergency room. Most studies found no
We looked at 84 different studies with over 22,000 people to see if talking to someone about drinking less alcohol helps. Most of the studies were done with people who were at a higher risk of drinking too much. We found that the studies that lasted at least four months were the most helpful in seeing if talking to someone helped people drink less. We found that talking to someone did help a little bit, but not enough to make a big difference. We found that people who talked to someone drank a little bit less alcohol and drank it a little bit less often. We also found that they didn't get as drunk when they did
This is a review of 29 studies that looked at different ways to teach people with asthma how to use their inhalers. The studies had between 2 and 26 weeks of follow-up and included 2210 people with asthma. The studies were divided into three groups: face-to-face training, multimedia training, and feedback devices. The studies showed that both face-to-face and multimedia training improved inhaler technique, but it was hard to compare the studies because they used different checklists. The studies also showed that feedback devices helped improve inhaler technique. However, it was unclear if these interventions led to better health outcomes for people with asthma
This text talks about a medicine called mannitol that was tested on people who had a stroke. The tests were done on 226 people in three different groups. The tests did not show if the medicine helped or hurt the people who took it. The doctors need to do more tests to see if the medicine is good for people who have a stroke.
Doctors did a study with 425 sick people who took D-penicillamine and 258 sick people who took a fake pill. The people who took D-penicillamine felt better than the people who took the fake pill. They had less pain, less swollen joints, and their doctors thought they were doing better. But, some people who took D-penicillamine had bad side effects like problems with their kidneys and blood. D-penicillamine can help people with rheumatoid arthritis, but it can also be dangerous. We don't know yet if it helps people in the long run.
We looked at four studies that used a special tea called Huangqi with chemotherapy. The studies were not very good, but they showed that the tea might help with some side effects of chemotherapy, like feeling sick and having low white blood cells. The tea also seemed to help some parts of the immune system. We didn't find any bad effects from the tea. But we need better studies to know for sure if the tea is helpful. We especially need to study a type of Huangqi called Astragalus spp.
We looked at a bunch of studies about using vitamins to help people with a disease called RP. Three of the studies had enough information for us to use. They had 866 people in them who were between 4 and 55 years old. One study looked at vitamin A by itself, one looked at DHA by itself, and one looked at both vitamin A and DHA together. We couldn't tell if the studies were completely fair because some important information was missing. None of the studies showed that the vitamins helped people's eyesight get better. Two of the studies showed that some people's eyes reacted differently to the vitamins, but
We looked at three studies with 414 people who were at risk of losing their jobs because of a disease called inflammatory arthritis. The studies tried to help people keep their jobs and do better at work. They did this by giving advice, education, and counseling. Some people also got visits from a doctor at work. The studies lasted from two sessions to six months. The people in the studies were found at clinics for people with arthritis. Two studies looked at job loss and one looked at missing work and how well people did their jobs. We found that the bigger study helped people keep their jobs better than the smaller one. We also found that
We looked at three studies that involved 285 babies from three different countries. Some of the babies were given a medicine called arginine, and some were given a fake medicine. We found that the babies who got arginine were less likely to get a serious stomach problem called NEC. They were also less likely to die from NEC. We did not find any bad side effects from the arginine. However, we need more studies to be sure that arginine is a good medicine for babies.
This is a report about some studies that looked at how well a medicine called INCS works for people with sinus infections. They looked at four studies with almost 2,000 people. The studies were well-done and compared INCS to a fake medicine or no medicine for 15 or 21 days. When they combined the results from three of the studies, they found that people who took INCS were more likely to feel better than those who took the fake medicine. Higher doses of INCS worked even better. There were no bad side effects reported. The studies didn't look at people with really bad sinus infections, but they suggest that
Doctors gave some medicine called vancomycin to some sick babies to help prevent them from getting more sick. The medicine helped reduce the number of babies who got sick again, but it didn't make them better faster or stop them from dying. The doctors aren't sure if using this medicine a lot will make germs that are harder to kill. So, they don't think it's a good idea to use this medicine all the time.
Scientists did some research on different things that can be put on wounds to help them heal after surgery. They found 14 reports from 13 different studies. One study showed that using aloe vera might make the wound heal slower, but they couldn't be sure because some people didn't come back to the study. Another study showed that using a plaster cast helped the wound heal faster than using elastic compression. They didn't find any big differences between using different types of dressings like gauze, foam, or alginate. But, some studies showed that using gauze caused more pain for patients and they were less happy with it
In 2014, some people did some studies on birth control for women. They looked at 11 studies in total, with some done a long time ago and some more recently. They studied 1482 women. Some studies looked at pills with two kinds of hormones, some looked at a small device that goes inside the uterus, and some looked at a different kind of implant. They found that most studies did not show any big differences between the groups of women in how long they breastfed their babies, what was in their breast milk, or how much their babies grew. But some older studies did show some differences. In two studies
We looked at 10 studies from different countries about how red-light cameras help prevent car crashes. Some studies adjusted for things like chance and other factors that could affect the results, while others did not. The studies that adjusted for these things found that red-light cameras can help reduce the number of crashes where people get hurt. However, the studies that did not adjust for these things were not as accurate. We need more studies to be sure, but it seems like red-light cameras can be helpful in preventing car crashes.
This is a study about a medicine called warfarin that helps people with blood clots. The study looked at four different tests with almost 500 people. The study found that using a certain amount of warfarin helped more people get better faster. One test showed that using a higher amount of warfarin helped outpatients with blood clots get better faster. Another test showed that using a lower amount of warfarin helped outpatients with blood clots get better faster. A third test showed no difference. The study also found that using a higher amount of warfarin did not cause more bleeding or make people stay in the
We looked at seven different tests with 555 people. Some tests compared better care in the hospital with regular care. Other tests compared better care in the hospital and at home after leaving the hospital with regular care. And some tests compared care from a doctor who specializes in older people with care from a different doctor. None of the tests were just for people with memory problems. We looked at the results from when people left the hospital until two years later. We think the tests might not be completely fair because they didn't have enough people in them and some people were different from others. We don't know for sure if the better care helped people
We looked at a lot of information (4226 titles) and found seven studies that had 840 people in them. The studies were different, but some showed that parents were less worried and kids behaved better when they got care at home. Some studies showed that parents were happier with home care, but one study didn't show any difference. Home care was more expensive for the people who provided it, but it saved money for families in two studies. The studies didn't show that home care made it harder to get hospital care or made kids sicker. We need more studies to know for sure.
In 2016, some people did research on a way to help people with mental illness. They looked at a lot of studies and found that a way called Intensive Case Management (ICM) might help some people. They compared ICM to regular care and found that ICM might help people stay out of the hospital and stay in treatment longer. They also found that ICM might help people do better in their social life, but they don't know if it helps with mental health or quality of life. They found that ICM works better for people who have been in the hospital a lot. They also found that ICM works
This is a review of different ways to train doctors to do surgery using a box model. They found that using a box model to train doctors is better than not having any training at all. They also looked at different ways to use the box model and found that some ways were better than others, but they need more studies to be sure. They say that more studies are needed to see if this kind of training helps patients and saves money.
There were two tests done to see if medicine could help people with a liver problem called primary sclerosing cholangitis. In the first test, they tried washing the liver with a medicine called hydrocortisone, but it made some people sick and didn't help their liver. So they stopped the test. In the second test, they compared two medicines called budesonide and prednisone. They found that prednisone made people's blood look worse than budesonide, but they didn't see any other big differences between the two medicines. They don't have enough proof to say if these medicines are good
This is a study about how feeding people who are sick or hurt can help them get better. The study looked at 11 different times when people were given food. Seven times, they got food early and four times they got it later. The people who got food early were less likely to die. Three times, they looked at how people were doing after they got better. The people who got food early were less likely to have problems. Seven times, they looked at two different ways of giving people food. Five times, they looked at how many people died. The people who got food one way were just as likely to die as the
We looked at 57 studies with over 34,000 people to see if using digital tools can help people drink less alcohol. We found that people who used digital tools drank about 3 fewer drinks per week than people who didn't use them. They also had fewer drinking days and binge drinking sessions. We didn't find a big difference between digital and face-to-face tools. We also found that certain strategies, like setting goals and solving problems, were helpful in reducing alcohol consumption. However, many studies didn't mention any strategies they used. Overall, using digital tools can help people drink less alcohol, but more research is needed to find
We looked at 24 studies with over 4000 people who were given either a medicine called benzodiazepine or a fake medicine called placebo. Some people were also given other medicines. We found that the studies were not very good quality and may not be completely accurate. We did see that benzodiazepine may work better than placebo for some things, but it can also cause more side effects. However, we don't know if it works well in the long-term or if it can be addictive. Doctors should talk to their patients and decide what medicine is best for them based on the good and bad things about each medicine
We looked at 16 different studies about tai chi, which is a type of exercise. Some studies had people who were healthy, while others had people with health problems like high blood pressure. We found that tai chi might help lower blood pressure and cholesterol in some people, but we need more studies to be sure. We also don't know if tai chi is safe or if it can prevent heart problems in the long term.
This is a study about ways to help kids not start smoking. They looked at 27 different ways to help families and kids. Some of the ways were different in each study. Most of the studies were done in the USA. Some kids got no help, and some got help at school. The studies were not all the same, so it was hard to compare them. But they found that family-based programs helped kids not start smoking. The best programs were ones that helped parents be caring and set rules. These programs worked best when kids were 11 to 14 years old. The programs might help reduce smoking by 16 to
This text talks about three studies that looked at how medicine called dexamethasone can help people with cancer feel less sick to their stomachs. The studies had a total of 451 people in them, and they lasted from seven to 14 days. Two of the studies compared dexamethasone to a fake medicine called a placebo, and the third study looked at different medicines used together. The studies found that dexamethasone helped people feel less sick, but the evidence was not very strong. The studies also did not look at how the medicine worked for different types of cancer. More studies are needed to know for
This is a study about how giving medicine called antibiotics to sick kids can help prevent them from getting lung infections. They looked at 10 different studies with kids who were at high risk of getting sick. Some of the kids had HIV, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, cancer, or were born too early and had breathing problems. The studies lasted from 7 days to 3 years. They found that some antibiotics helped reduce the number of times the kids got sick and had to go to the hospital. They also found that the antibiotics did not cause many bad side effects. However, they need to do more studies to be
We looked at nine studies that compared different gases used during surgery. The gases were nitrous oxide, helium, room air, and carbon dioxide. We wanted to see if using different gases had any effects on how well the surgery went and if there were any problems. For nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, we didn't find enough evidence to say if one was better than the other. For helium and carbon dioxide, we also didn't find enough evidence to say if one was better than the other. One study showed that using room air during surgery might be cheaper and cause less pain on the first day after surgery compared to using carbon
This is a review of 14 studies about a medicine called dexamethasone. The studies looked at how much of the medicine was given and when it was given to babies who were born too early. Some studies showed that giving a moderate amount of the medicine increased the risk of lung problems and brain problems. Other studies showed that giving the medicine early or late didn't make a big difference. Some studies showed that giving the medicine in short bursts was worse than giving it continuously. However, the studies were small and not very good, so we can't say for sure what the best way to give the medicine is. We need a
This is a report about some studies that were done to see if certain medicines could help people with heart problems. The studies were done a long time ago, some as far back as the 1950s. The researchers looked at eight studies that involved almost 1,000 people. They compared different medicines to see if they helped reduce the risk of heart disease. They found that using certain medicines did not make a big difference in reducing the risk of heart disease. Some studies did not report any bad side effects, but others did. However, the researchers say that we should be careful when looking at these results because the studies were done a
We looked at six studies with over 12,000 people from 79 places. Some studies found that using bug spray can help reduce trachoma by 55% to 61%. But one study didn't find it helpful. Another study found that having a bathroom can help a little bit, but we're not sure if it really works. Some studies found that teaching people about health can help reduce trachoma, but not all studies agree. We still need more information to know for sure what works best to stop trachoma.
This text talks about a study that looked at different ways to help people with a condition called CFS. They found that a type of therapy called CBT was better than just regular care or other types of therapy at reducing tiredness. However, they need more studies to know for sure what the best treatment is.
This is a study about how vitamin D affects people with sickle cell disease. 46 people were in the study, but only 39 finished it. They were split into two groups, one group got vitamin D and the other group got a fake pill called a placebo. The group that got vitamin D had more of it in their blood than the other group. They also had less pain, but their quality of life was not as good as the other group. The study was not good enough to tell doctors what to do, so they should follow other guidelines until more studies are done.
This is a review of a study that looked at two different treatments for children who have trouble speaking clearly. The study had 26 children between the ages of 4 and 12. The treatments were called NDP-3 and ReST, and they were given for three weeks, four days a week, for one hour each day. The study found that both treatments helped the children speak more clearly, but there was no evidence to say that one treatment was better than the other. The study did not look at whether the treatments helped the children communicate better in their daily lives. More studies are needed to see if these treatments work for other children
Scientists did some studies to see if antibiotics can help people with a problem in their eyes called toxoplasma retinochoroiditis. They looked at four studies with 268 people. In all four studies, people took antibiotics by mouth. One study in Brazil looked at both adults and children and compared one antibiotic to no treatment. The other three studies compared antibiotics to a fake pill. The studies showed that antibiotics can help reduce the risk of getting the eye problem again. But, there is not enough evidence to show that antibiotics can make people's vision better. Some people in the studies had side effects like feeling sick or having a rash
We looked at 43 studies about older people who broke their hip near the top. In 22 of those studies, doctors compared two different ways of fixing the hip. One way was called the Gamma nail and the other was called the sliding hip screw. The Gamma nail had more problems like breaking again and needing another surgery. But both ways had similar problems like getting an infection or dying. In five studies, doctors compared the sliding hip screw to another way called the intramedullary hip screw. The intramedullary hip screw had more problems fixing the hip. But both ways had similar problems after surgery like getting an infection or dying
We looked at a lot of information about how to help women with a certain kind of cancer. We found one study that looked at two ways to help these women: surgery or medicine. The study found that the women who had surgery lived longer than the women who had medicine. But some of the women who had surgery had problems and a few even died. We don't know for sure which way is better because we didn't have a lot of good information to look at. But it seems like surgery might be a good way to help these women live longer.
This text talks about some studies that were done on women with a condition called PCOS. The studies looked at how two different medicines called simvastatin and atorvastatin affected the women. The studies found that these medicines did not help with things like getting regular periods, getting pregnant, or reducing hair growth or acne. However, the medicines did help lower a hormone called testosterone and improve some things in the blood like cholesterol. No bad side effects were reported. But, more research needs to be done to see if these medicines can help with other things.
We looked at a lot of information about how to help women with cervical cancer who have bleeding in their vagina. We found 1522 things to read, but we only read 22 of them because the others didn't seem helpful. We learned that there isn't enough proof to say which treatment is best. It depends on where you live and what resources are available. Some treatments are hard to get in places where there isn't a lot of money. We need more studies to figure out which treatment is best for women with advanced cervical cancer who have bleeding in their vagina.
Doctors did some tests on a medicine called temozolomide to see if it could help people with a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). They found that when people took temozolomide with radiation therapy, they lived longer and their cancer didn't get worse as quickly. But, temozolomide did not make people feel better. It also caused some side effects like feeling tired and getting infections. When they tested temozolomide on people whose cancer came back, they found that it did not make them live longer, but it did make their cancer not get worse
We looked at two studies. One study in Cambodia found that when international groups work with the government to manage health care, more people go to the doctor and use public hospitals. But it didn't make people healthier. The other study found that when health care managers get training every so often, they do a better job. In Latin America, managers who got training had fewer problems than those who didn't. We need more studies to know if these ideas will work in other places. We also need to look at other ways to help health care managers do their job better.
We looked at three studies with 123 people. Some people got surgery and some got medicine. We don't know if the people doing the study knew who got what. Two studies didn't say how they picked who got what. Two studies had people die, but we don't know if one treatment was better than the other for keeping people alive. Six people died overall from things like pneumonia and infections. People who got surgery had less problems with their chest and breathing. They also didn't need a tube in their throat as much. We looked at how long people stayed in the hospital and how long they needed help breathing. Some studies said
Scientists did a study to see how well a medicine called cerivastatin works to lower cholesterol in people. They looked at 50 different studies with over 12,000 people of all ages who had high cholesterol. The studies lasted from 3 to 12 weeks. The medicine worked well to lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and total cholesterol, but didn't have much effect on good cholesterol (HDL). Cerivastatin was stronger than other similar medicines at lowering cholesterol. The studies didn't show many bad side effects from the medicine, but some studies didn't report them.
We looked at 28 studies with 6851 patients to see if a treatment called remote ischaemic preconditioning helps reduce kidney damage after heart or blood vessel surgery. Most of the studies were done well. We found that this treatment did not make much of a difference in reducing kidney damage or the need for dialysis. It also did not make a difference in how long patients stayed in the hospital or if they died. We did find that it may slightly improve the chance of getting acute kidney injury. The treatment seems safe and does not cause many side effects. However, we need more research to know for sure if it helps reduce kidney
We looked at a lot of information about how to help people who feel very tired after having a stroke. We found 12 studies that had information we could use. Eight of these studies looked at different ways to treat the tiredness, like using medicine or teaching people how to relax. We found that the people who got these treatments felt less tired than the people who didn't. But, some of the studies were not done very well, so we need to do more research to be sure. We didn't find any studies that looked at how to stop people from feeling tired after a stroke. We need to do more studies with more people
Some doctors did some studies on how to help babies who were born too early and have too much potassium in their blood. They looked at three different studies with a total of 74 babies. One study showed that using insulin and sugar together might be better than using a special medicine that goes in the bottom. Another study showed that using a special breathing treatment might help lower the potassium level. None of the babies had any bad side effects from these treatments. But because the studies were small and not very good, doctors can't say for sure which treatment is best. They need to do more studies to find out.
This is a review of twelve different tests that looked at two treatments for a sickness. The sickness makes it hard for people to move and do things. One treatment is called IVIg and the other is called PE. The tests showed that both treatments work about the same for most people. But, for kids, IVIg helped them get better faster than just getting regular care. The tests also showed that IVIg is easier to finish than PE. This means that people are more likely to finish all of their IVIg treatments. The tests did not show that one treatment was better than the other for people who had a mild
We looked at 28 different studies with 9,330 people. In 21 of those studies, 7,597 people were given more oxygen than usual during surgery. We found that giving more oxygen did not increase the chance of people dying or getting an infection after surgery. However, we need more studies to be sure. We also found that giving antibiotics before surgery and using a blind test to check for infections may help reduce the risk of infections. Overall, we don't have enough evidence to say that giving more oxygen during surgery is always a good idea. We need more studies to be sure.
This is a study about using medicine to help kids with ear problems. They looked at 25 different tests with over 3,600 kids. They found that using medicine helped some kids feel better, but it also made some kids have diarrhea, vomiting, or a rash. They also found that using medicine did not always help with hearing problems. They did not find any information about how medicine affects things like talking or thinking. It's important to be careful when using medicine because it can have good and bad effects.
This text talks about how eating less protein might help people with diabetes keep their kidneys healthy. Some studies showed that people who ate less protein had a lower risk of kidney problems. However, there were also some studies that didn't show a big difference. It's important to do more research to see if eating less protein is really helpful for everyone with diabetes.
We looked at 19 studies with 3480 people. Some studies were good and some were not as good. We found that people with mild brain injuries can recover well with just information and advice. People with more serious injuries need more help, like formal therapy. People who get therapy early do better. People who get intensive therapy do better too. People who are in a group with others who have similar problems can also do well. But, it's hard to know what works best for everyone in the long term. We need more studies to figure that out.
We looked at one study that involved 176 women. The study had four groups that looked at where the baby was and what clothes they wore. We combined three of the groups and called it the "rooming-in" group. The fourth group was called the "separate care" group. We found that there was no difference in how long the babies were breastfed between the two groups. We also found that more babies in the "rooming-in" group were exclusively breastfed before leaving the hospital. We need more studies to see if it's better for babies to stay in the same room as their moms or not.
This is a study about a medicine called sanchi for people who had a stroke. 660 people were in the study. Most of the studies were not very good. The study lasted less than a month for most people. Only two studies showed that sanchi helped more than the regular treatment. One study showed that people who took sanchi had better scores on a test. Another study showed that sanchi might help people's brains work better after a stroke. Only a few people had bad side effects. The study shows that sanchi might be helpful and safe for people who had a mild stroke, but more studies
Scientists looked at 14 studies about putting in fake teeth, but only 7 were good enough to use. They found that putting in fake teeth right away or waiting a little bit both have good and bad things about them. Some people liked getting their fake teeth right away, but there were more problems with them. Other people waited a little bit and had fewer problems, but it took longer to get their fake teeth. They also looked at different ways to make the fake teeth stay in better, but they couldn't tell which way was the best. Overall, they need more information to know for sure what the best way is to put in
Scientists tested two different drugs on people with Alzheimer's disease. The first drug, called PBT1, was tested on 36 patients, but it did not show any improvement in memory or other symptoms compared to a fake pill. One person who took PBT1 had some problems with their eyesight, but it got better when they stopped taking the drug. The second drug, called PBT2, was tested on 78 people with mild Alzheimer's disease. After 12 weeks, the drug did not show any improvement in memory, but it did help with some other thinking skills like coming up with words and following a trail. The
We looked at 36 studies with almost 3000 people who had a lung problem called pulmonary hypertension. Some of the studies lasted for 14 weeks, while others lasted for up to a year. Two of the studies were just for kids. In 19 of the studies, the people had a specific type of pulmonary hypertension called group 1 PAH. We found that people with group 1 PAH who took medicine called PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to feel better and walk farther than people who didn't take the medicine. They were also less likely to die. However, the medicine can cause some side effects like headaches,
We looked at a bunch of studies where people got numbing medicine for hand, wrist, forearm, or elbow surgery. We found that using more than one shot of medicine worked better than just one or two shots. Using a special tool to find the nerves worked better than just guessing where to put the medicine. Using more shots of medicine made the surgery less painful. But, it took longer to give the medicine. We need more studies to know if it's safe to use more shots of medicine.
We looked at a lot of papers and found three that talked about using a medicine called beclomethasone to help kids with asthma. They used it for 7 to 12 months and gave it to the kids twice a day. The medicine helped with asthma, but it also made the kids grow a little bit less. On average, they grew 1.54 centimeters less each year. We don't know if this will keep happening or if they will catch up later. If your child needs this medicine, it's important to use the smallest amount that works and watch how they grow.
This text talks about two different ways to do dialysis (a medical treatment for people with kidney problems). The study looked at 139 patients who tried both ways. They found that there was no big difference between the two ways in terms of things like risk of infection, needing to switch to a different treatment, or going to the hospital. One study did find that people on one type of dialysis had less infections and hospital visits, and another study found that people on that same type of dialysis had more time for work and fun activities. Overall, both types of dialysis are pretty similar, but some people might prefer one over the
Doctors looked at information from 37 different studies that included 9,312 patients. They compared different treatments for a type of cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma. They found that a treatment called CRT was better than another treatment called RT for keeping people alive and stopping the cancer from getting worse. CRT was also better than another treatment called CT for stopping the cancer from getting worse. However, CRT did have a higher risk of side effects. For people with early stage cancer, CRT was the best treatment. For people with more advanced cancer, CRT was better at stopping the cancer from getting worse, but CT caused fewer side effects. Overall,
We looked at 26 studies that had 27 groups of people who were being treated for pain. There were 4,893 people in total. The treatment was either a pill, a patch, or a shot. Some people stopped taking the medicine because it didn't help their pain or because it made them feel bad. Only a few people became addicted to the medicine. The medicine did help some people feel better, but we're not sure if it made their life better or helped them do things they couldn't do before. Some people had minor problems like feeling sick, but serious problems were rare.
This is a study about a medicine called oxandrolone that was given to people with spinal cord injuries and open sores. The study had 212 people, mostly men, and compared oxandrolone to a fake medicine called a placebo. The study looked at whether the sores got better and if there were any bad side effects. The study found that there was not enough evidence to know if oxandrolone helped the sores get better or made them worse. The study also found that oxandrolone may cause more non-serious side effects. The study did not look at other things like pain or how much it
We looked at six studies that involved 8372 people. Some studies compared sending emails to sending regular mail, and some compared sending emails to not doing anything special. We wanted to see if sending emails helped people take better care of their health. We found that sending emails did not make a big difference in how many people got preventive screenings. It also did not make a difference in how much people understood about their health or how much support they got. We are not sure if sending emails helped people take better care of themselves. We also do not know if sending emails to doctors or nurses is safe or helpful. The studies we looked at were
This is a study about a treatment for a type of dizziness called BPPV. The treatment is called the Epley manoeuvre. The study looked at 11 different times when people tried this treatment, and 855 people were involved. Some of the times, people did the Epley manoeuvre with a special way of sitting afterwards. This way of sitting didn't make a big difference in how well the treatment worked. But, when people did the Epley manoeuvre with the special way of sitting, more of them had a test that showed they were feeling better. This test is called the Dix-Hallpike
This is a review of four studies that looked at different treatments for people with a problem called chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The studies compared surgery to different types and amounts of medicine. The studies found that there was no big difference between the treatments in how people felt or how their quality of life was. One study found that surgery helped with a problem called polyposis, but this was only in one study and needs more research. The studies did not report how often the problem came back. Some people had complications from the treatments, but they were not very common. The studies were not very good quality, so more research
We did a study with 709 people from different countries. Some of these countries have a problem with not having enough zinc in their food. We gave some people food with extra zinc and compared it to food without extra zinc. We found that the people who ate the food with extra zinc had more zinc in their blood. We also looked at whether the food with extra zinc helped people grow and stay healthy, but we didn't find enough evidence to say for sure. We need to do more studies to find out if adding zinc to food is helpful.
Scientists looked at 11 studies with over 3000 people to see if a certain medicine helped men with prostate cancer. They found that this medicine, called non-steroidal antiandrogens, did not work as well as other treatments. It made people more likely to have problems and stop taking the medicine. Some of the problems were breast pain and growing breasts. The medicine did help with some problems like hot flashes and needing to pee a lot. The scientists think more research is needed to find better treatments for men with prostate cancer.
Scientists looked at eight different studies about breast cancer screening. One of the studies didn't work because the groups being compared weren't the same. The other seven studies included 600,000 women between the ages of 39 and 74. Three of the studies didn't show a big difference in breast cancer deaths after 13 years, but four of the studies did show a difference. When they looked at all seven studies together, they found that screening for breast cancer reduced the risk of dying from it. However, they also found that screening led to more women having surgery and radiation, even if they didn't need it. They also found
We looked at four studies with 522 women to see if a medicine called hCG helps women get pregnant during a special kind of treatment called IVM. Three studies used 10,000 units of hCG and one study used 20,000 units. Three studies only included women with PCOS, while one study did not allow women with PCOS. We found that hCG did not make a big difference in the number of live births, miscarriages, or clinical pregnancies compared to not using hCG. However, we did find that hCG might lower the chance of getting pregnant. We need more studies to know for sure if
Scientists studied how a type of medicine called ERT or HRT affects the brain of older women who have gone through menopause. They looked at 24 different tests, but only 16 of them had good information. They found that taking ERT or HRT did not help the women's brains work better. In fact, some women's brains got worse after taking the medicine for a year or more. Some smaller tests showed no benefit at all. We don't know if some types of the medicine might help certain women, but we need more research to find out. For now, doctors don't recommend ERT or HRT to
We looked at two studies with 880 people who have a lung disease called COPD. The studies lasted 12 weeks and tested two different kinds of medicine. One medicine was a combination of two drugs that you breathe in, and the other medicine was just one drug that you breathe in. We found that the two medicines were about the same in how well they worked and how safe they were. But, we are not completely sure because the studies were not very good quality and did not test everything we wanted to know. We need more studies to be sure which medicine is better.
This is a study about different ways to help people with a condition called BDD. They looked at two types of medicine and three types of talking therapy. They found that one medicine called fluoxetine worked better than a fake medicine. They also found that the talking therapy called CBT helped people feel better. One study showed that only a few people got sick again after CBT. The study was small, so they need to do more research to make sure these treatments work well. They also want to study more types of therapy and different ages of people.
This is a study about a medicine called cotrimoxazole that helps prevent infections in people with HIV. The study looked at two different ways of giving the medicine to people who had a mild or moderate allergic reaction to it before. One way was to slowly give them a small amount of the medicine until they could handle the full dose. The other way was to just give them the full dose right away. The study found that the slow way was better because fewer people had to stop taking the medicine and fewer people had bad reactions to it. No one had a really bad reaction in either group. The study suggests that more research is needed to
We looked at three studies with 148 babies. They gave some babies a medicine called midazolam to help them sleep, and some babies got a fake medicine called a placebo. The babies who got midazolam slept better, but we don't know if it's safe for babies who were born too early. The babies who got midazolam stayed in the hospital longer than the babies who got the fake medicine. One study showed that midazolam helped babies feel less pain, but another study showed that it might not be safe for babies' brains. We need more research to know if midazolam is
This is a study about medicine for people who have diarrhea caused by a germ called NTS. The study looked at 12 tests with 767 people. The study found that the medicine did not make a big difference in how long the diarrhea lasted or how sick people felt. The medicine did help get rid of the germ faster, but it also caused more side effects. The study says that for healthy people, the medicine is not needed. But, we don't know if it's helpful for very young or very old people, or people who are very sick.
We looked at 23 studies with 4192 people to see if a test called IL-6 can help diagnose a serious infection called sepsis in very sick adults. Some studies were only talked about at meetings and we still need to learn more about them. The people in the studies were different ages, genders, and from different places. Some had sepsis and some didn't. We found that the test is not always accurate and can sometimes say someone has sepsis when they don't, or not say someone has sepsis when they do. If we use this test on 1000 sick adults, about
We looked at 29 different tests with over 5,000 people to see if covering wounds with different types of bandages helps prevent infections. Most of the tests were not very good because they were too small or didn't give clear information. Some tests were done on people with clean wounds, some on people with slightly dirty wounds, and some on people with very dirty wounds. Some tests compared different types of bandages, while others looked at whether it was better to cover the wound or leave it open. We found that we are not sure if covering the wound with a bandage or leaving it open is better for preventing infections. We
We looked at two studies about how to prevent moms from feeling sad after having a baby. In one study, some moms took a pill with a little bit of a mineral called selenium, and some moms took a fake pill. The moms who took the real pill didn't feel as sad, but we're not sure if it was just a coincidence. Some moms didn't finish the study, so we're not totally sure if the pill really helped. In the other study, some moms took pills with special oils called EPA and DHA, and some moms took a fake pill. The moms who took the real pills didn't feel less
We looked at 11 studies about how to give medicine called anthracycline to people with cancer. Seven studies looked at how long to give the medicine for, and four studies looked at how much of the medicine to give. We found that giving the medicine for six hours or longer is better than giving it for a shorter time. This helps reduce the chance of heart problems. We also found that giving a lower or higher dose of the medicine did not make a big difference in heart problems. However, we need more research to be sure about this. The studies were done on adults with different types of cancer, so we need to do
We looked at 37 studies with over 3000 people who had a brain injury. Some of these studies were new and some were looked at again. The studies included both adults and children. Most of the studies started treatment right away and continued it for at least 24 hours. We looked at how many people died, had bad outcomes, or got pneumonia. But the results were different in each study, so we couldn't combine them to make a big conclusion. We also couldn't tell if the studies were done well or not. We used a special way to judge how good the evidence was, and we found that there isn't
Some people did some studies to see if family therapy can help people with depression. They looked at six studies with 519 people. The studies were different in how they helped people and who was in them. Some studies showed that family therapy can help with depression, but not enough to be sure. We need more studies to know for sure if family therapy is a good way to help with depression. For now, it might be better to use other ways that we know work. We need more studies to see if family therapy is a good way to help with depression.
This is a study about a medicine called Duxil that was given to people with a type of memory problem called vascular dementia. The study looked at three different groups of people who took the medicine. The study found that the medicine helped improve how well the people could think, but it did not help with their ability to do things like getting dressed or eating. The study also found that the medicine did not cause any bad side effects. However, the study was not very well done and did not give enough evidence to say that everyone with dementia should take this medicine. More studies are needed to know for sure if this medicine is helpful.
Some doctors did a study with almost 1,000 people to see if using a tube called a drain after surgery to remove lymph nodes would help. They found that using a drain made it less likely for people to get a fluid buildup called a seroma and they needed fewer treatments to fix it. But, people who had a drain had to stay in the hospital a little longer. They didn't find a big difference in infections, swelling, or bleeding. The study wasn't perfect, so we can't be completely sure if using a drain is always the best choice.
Some people did eight studies with almost 400,000 people to see if eating certain things called flavonoids can help prevent a type of cancer called colorectal cancer. They looked at different types of studies and how good they were. Some studies said that flavonoids might help prevent cancer, but others said they didn't. Some types of flavonoids might be helpful, but more research is needed to be sure. It's hard to know how much flavonoids people are eating, so it's hard to say for sure if they can help prevent cancer.
We did a study with 1369 people in seven different tests. All of the tests had some problems. Some of the tests used one definition of slow responders, and some used another definition. We found that if we treated people for 72 weeks instead of 48 weeks, more people got better and stayed better. But we need more information to know if this is the best way to treat people who are slow responders. We didn't find any differences in side effects between the two treatments.
This is a review of two studies that looked at a test called EUS for pancreatic cancer. The test helps doctors see if the cancer can be removed with surgery. One study was good and the other was not as good. The studies found that after a CT scan, about 60 out of 100 people had cancer that could not be removed with surgery. The EUS test was pretty good at finding this out, but not perfect. If the EUS test said the cancer could not be removed, there was an 86.9% chance that it was true. If the EUS test said the cancer could be removed, there
This is a review of 34 studies about a problem called blepharitis, which is when your eyelids get swollen and red. Some studies looked at people with a type of blepharitis called anterior or mixed, and others looked at people with a type called posterior. The studies tested different treatments, like antibiotics and cleaning your eyelids. The results showed that antibiotics and cleaning your eyelids can help with some symptoms, but there is no strong evidence that any treatment can cure blepharitis completely. Some products that are sold to help with blepharitis may not actually work. More research is needed to find out
We did a study with 23 people, but it wasn't a very good study. We didn't measure most of the things we wanted to, and there wasn't a big difference between the groups. One person had trouble breathing after the treatment. We don't have enough good evidence to know if this treatment helps people with a certain disease. We need more studies with more people and over a longer time to see if it really works. We should also measure how people feel and how well they can breathe and talk.
We looked at 42 studies with 4220 people to see how well ultrasound tests can find problems with blood vessels. Some studies used a special dye to help see the blood vessels better. We found that the tests with the dye were better at finding problems than the tests without it. Some of the studies were not done very well, which means we can't be sure if the results are accurate. We also found that the tests done before 2006 were better at finding problems than the tests done after 2006. Overall, the tests were good at showing when there was a problem, but we still need to use a CT scan
We looked at seven studies with 766 people who had back pain during childbirth. Some people got injections of sterile water and some got a placebo. The studies showed that people who got the sterile water had less pain than those who got the placebo. However, the studies were too different to combine the results and we couldn't tell if the sterile water helped with other things like having a C-section or breastfeeding. Some people who got the sterile water said they would want it again in the future. But, we need more studies to know for sure if sterile water is helpful for pain during childbirth.
This is a study about using glue or stitches to fix a hernia. A hernia is when part of your insides push through a hole in your muscles. The study looked at 12 different times when people had surgery for a hernia. In total, 1932 people were in the study. The study found that using glue to fix the hernia reduced pain after surgery by 37%. This was compared to using stitches. However, the type of mesh used also affected the results. When a lightweight mesh was used, the reduction in pain was not as big. But when a heavyweight mesh was used, the glue worked better
We looked at a bunch of studies about fixing mistakes in writing. Some studies tested different ways to fix mistakes, like having rules for writers to follow or having someone check the writing before it gets published. The studies showed that these things can help make the writing better and easier to understand. But, not many studies have been done on this topic. Also, many times people make mistakes when they write down where they got their information from. This happens a lot in science writing.
We looked at 15 studies with 721 adults who had cancer pain. Most studies used a medicine called codeine, sometimes with another medicine called paracetamol. Some studies used a fake medicine called a placebo or other real medicines. Most studies only looked at how the medicine worked for a short time, like one day. Codeine seemed to work better than the fake medicine, but it made some people feel sick or constipated. We don't know if it's safe to use for a long time. None of the studies were done on kids.
This is a study about how educational programs can help people with sickle cell disease. The study looked at 12 different trials with 563 people between the ages of 6 and 35. Most of the people were African-American. The programs ranged from one hour to eight weeks long and were meant to teach people about their disease. The study found that the programs helped improve patient and caregiver knowledge about sickle cell disease. The programs also helped decrease depression in patients. However, the study did not find any evidence that the programs helped with things like coping, family relationships, or quality of life. The study suggests that more research is needed
This is a report about six different studies that looked at how well a medicine called brivaracetam works for people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition where people have seizures. The studies included 2411 adults between 16 and 80 years old who had seizures that were hard to control with other medicines. Some of the studies included people with different types of seizures, but most only included people with one type. The studies lasted between 7 and 16 weeks. Two of the studies were good, but four were not as good. The studies found that people who took brivaracetam had fewer seizures and were more likely
We looked at 38 studies about how parents feel about getting their kids vaccinated. Most of the studies were done in rich countries. Parents wanted more information about vaccines than they were getting. When they didn't have enough information, some parents felt worried and regretted their decision to vaccinate their kids. Parents wanted to know about the good and bad things about vaccines, and they wanted the information to be easy to understand and fit their situation. They also wanted to get the information from different places, not just from the doctor's office. Parents thought that doctors and nurses were important sources of information, but sometimes they didn't like how they were
We looked at 10 different studies about people with anorexia. In total, there were 599 people in these studies. Some of the studies were new and some we already knew about. Two of the studies were about kids. The studies tested different ways to help people with anorexia, but it was hard to compare them because they were so different. We found that one type of therapy called "focal psychodynamic therapy" might work better than just regular treatment. But we need more studies to be sure. We also found that some types of therapy were just as good as others. One study tried to use just giving advice
This is a report about three studies that looked at different ways to treat a problem with the eye called retinal detachment. The studies included over 500 people from different countries. The doctors tried different types of liquids to put in the eye to help fix the problem. They found that two of the liquids worked about the same, but one didn't work as well. They also found that a new type of liquid called heavy silicone oil did not work better than the regular kind. Some people had side effects from the treatment, but the studies did not give a lot of information about them. The doctors did a good job of choosing people for the
We looked at five studies that involved 1819 women. We found that women who had planned early delivery had a lower risk of getting very sick or dying compared to women who did not have early delivery. This was especially true for women with a condition called HELLP syndrome or severe kidney problems. However, babies born from planned early delivery had a higher risk of having breathing problems and needing to go to the NICU. We need more studies to understand the best time for early delivery for different types of pregnancy problems.
This text talks about how doctors treat kids with a disease called hemophilia. They did six studies with 142 kids. Two of the studies looked at giving medicine three times a week to prevent bleeding, versus only giving medicine when there was bleeding. The results showed that giving medicine to prevent bleeding worked better. Three of the other studies looked at a medicine called prophylaxis for kids with hemophilia A. One of the studies showed that prophylaxis helped prevent joint bleeds. Two of the studies looked at different ways to give prophylaxis, but they didn't find one way was better than the other. The last study looked at
We looked at some studies about how to treat a sickness called BL. We found 13 studies, but only 10 had information we could use. Some of the studies didn't give enough information about how they did the study. We couldn't combine the information from all the studies because they were different. Some studies tried to make the sickness go away, and others tried to keep it from coming back. We found that less strong treatments worked just as well and had fewer side effects. Newer studies like these treatments better. But, we can't be sure because the studies were small and might not be completely accurate. We added one more
This is a study about giving medicine to pregnant women who don't have a certain protein called RhD. The medicine is called anti-D and it helps protect the baby. The study looked at two ways of giving the medicine, through a shot in the muscle (IM) or through a vein (IV). The study found that both ways of giving the medicine worked the same and neither caused any problems. However, the study was too small to say for sure if one way was better than the other. Doctors can choose which way to give the medicine based on what they have available and what the patient likes.
This is a report about studies done on people with diabetes. They looked at two different medicines, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, and compared them to aspirin or a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. The studies were done on people who had heart problems before or had a high risk of getting them. The studies lasted from one to two and a half years. They found that ticlopidine did not make a big difference in how many people died or had heart problems. They also looked at how these medicines affected the risk of stroke, but the results were not clear. They did not have information
This text talks about a study that looked at how a special kind of breathing machine called non-invasive ventilation can help people with cystic fibrosis. The study looked at 10 different experiments with a total of 191 people. Some of the experiments lasted a few weeks or months, while others were just one session. The study found that non-invasive ventilation can make it easier for people with cystic fibrosis to clear their airways and breathe better while they sleep. It may also help them exercise better. However, some people had trouble using the machine and there were some side effects. The study suggests that more research is needed to
This is a report about a treatment called NIPPV for people with a lung disease called COPD. The report looked at seven studies with 245 people. They measured things like how far people could walk, how well they breathed, and how they slept. They found that NIPPV did not make a big difference in these things. Some studies showed a small improvement, but they were not sure if it was enough to really help people. They also looked at two studies that lasted a year, but they did not show any big improvements either. However, the studies were small, so they are not completely sure if NIPPV helps
We looked at four studies with 1190 women to see if inducing labor for big babies was a good idea. We found that inducing labor did not increase the chance of having a C-section or needing help with delivery. It did lower the chance of the baby getting stuck and having a broken bone during birth. However, it did increase the chance of the mom having a tear during delivery. The weight of the baby was also lower when labor was induced. Doctors should talk to parents about the pros and cons of inducing labor for big babies. More studies are needed to figure out the best time to induce labor and how to accurately tell if a
We looked at 159 studies about a vitamin called Vitamin D. In 56 of those studies, with over 95,000 people, we found that taking Vitamin D lowered the chance of dying. Most of the people in the studies were women over 70 years old. Some of the studies included healthy people, while others included people with health problems like heart or lung disease. Vitamin D was given for about 4 years. We found that only one type of Vitamin D, called Vitamin D3, helped lower the chance of dying. Other types of Vitamin D did not help. Vitamin D3 also helped lower the chance of dying from
Scientists studied some medicines that can help people lose weight. They looked at three medicines called fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine. They did 22 tests with 296 people using fluoxetine, 2036 people using orlistat, and 1047 people using sibutramine. The medicines helped people lose some weight, but not a lot. They also had some side effects like stomach problems, shaking, and heart palpitations. Other medicines were studied too, but they didn't have enough information to say if they worked or not. The scientists think more research is needed to see if these medicines
We looked at five studies with 734 people. Only one study was good quality and the other four were not so good. We wanted to combine all the results, but it was hard because the studies didn't all look at the same things. We found that two medicines, VGB and CBZ, were about the same for how long they worked and how well they worked. But VGB was worse for causing seizures. VGB made people gain weight more often, but it caused fewer rashes and less sleepiness than CBZ. We don't have enough information to say which medicine is better overall. But we do know that V
We looked at four studies about a medicine called plerixafor for people with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Two of the studies stopped early because not enough people joined. The other two studies had 600 people and compared plerixafor to a fake medicine. We found that plerixafor helped people collect more stem cells for a transplant, but we don't know if it helped them live longer or have fewer side effects. Some of the studies were not published, so we might not have all the information.
We looked at 23 studies that involved 1806 women. 717 of those women used cones. The studies were small and some were hard to understand. The results were also hard to compare because they measured different things. Some studies had a lot of people drop out. 7 studies were only summaries. Cones were better than no treatment for incontinence. But, cones were not better than other treatments like PFMT or electrostimulation. We don't know if cones and PFMT together are better than just cones or just PFMT. Only 7 studies looked at how the women felt and none looked at money.
This is a study about how to help people with a heart condition called AF. They looked at 11 different studies with a total of 2246 patients. Some of the studies taught people about their condition, some gave them tools to make decisions, and some helped them keep track of their health. They found that teaching people about their condition helped them feel less anxious and less sad. But they weren't sure if the other things they tried helped. They need to do more studies to figure out what works best for people with this condition.
This is a study about a medicine called PGE2 that helps women give birth. The study looked at 70 different tests with over 11,000 women. They added 7 new tests with 778 women. Some of the new tests compared different forms of PGE2. The study found that PGE2 probably helps women give birth within 24 hours, but it can also cause some problems like making the baby's heart beat faster. It might also lower the chance of having a C-section by 10%. The study is not sure if PGE2 is good for both the mom and the baby. Different forms of P
Scientists looked at 11 studies about how to take care of babies. They found 5 studies that had 247 babies in them. They compared taking care of babies in a special bed called an incubator to taking care of babies in a regular bed called a cot. They found that there was no big difference in body temperature between the two beds. But, in one study, more babies in the cot bed got too hot. They also found that babies in the cot bed didn't gain as much weight and were breastfed less often when they left the hospital. But, they didn't find enough proof to say for sure that these things
We looked at three studies with 146 people. Two of the studies were not very good. We found that two ways of fixing teeth that are in the wrong place might work the same. One person had a problem with the gold chain used in the surgery. One study found two people had problems after surgery. We couldn't combine all the information from the studies, but they didn't find any big differences between the two ways of fixing the teeth. We need more studies to be sure. There are three more studies happening now that might help us know more.
We did some tests on 244 women to see if a medicine called prostaglandin could help with a problem called retained placenta. This is when the placenta doesn't come out of the mom's body after the baby is born. We found that prostaglandin didn't work better than a fake medicine in reducing the need for doctors to remove the placenta by hand, or in reducing heavy bleeding or the need for a blood transfusion. The women who took prostaglandin had more shivering than those who took the fake medicine. We need to do more research to know for sure if prostaglandin is
We looked at six studies that involved 355 babies who had trouble breathing. Some babies used a mask over their face to help them breathe, while others had a tube in their nose or throat. We found that using a certain type of pressure called continuous distending pressure (CDP) helped lower the risk of babies dying or needing help to breathe. But, using CDP also increased the risk of a condition called pneumothorax. We didn't find any difference in another condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) or in how the babies did when they were older. Using CDP can help babies breathe
We looked at six studies with 157 people to see if foam bandages help heal foot sores in people with diabetes. Two studies showed that foam bandages did not work better than regular bandages. Two other studies showed that foam and alginate bandages worked about the same. There was no difference between foam and hydrocolloid bandages either. All the studies were small and didn't last very long. Right now, there isn't enough evidence to say that foam bandages are better than other types of bandages for healing foot sores in people with diabetes. People who make decisions about bandages might want to think about things
We looked at three different studies. Two of them compared a surgery to a special camera procedure for people with a certain kind of stomach problem. The surgery helped more people feel better and have a better quality of life, but only for a few years. The camera procedure didn't help as much. The third study compared surgery to just taking medicine for the same stomach problem. The surgery helped more people feel better and keep their stomach working well. But this study was small and had some problems. Overall, the studies showed that surgery can be a good way to help people with this stomach problem feel better, but more studies are needed to be sure
This is a report about a study that looked at whether it's better to take a shower soon after having a small surgery or to wait a couple of days. The study included 857 people who had a small surgery to remove something from their skin. Half of them took a shower soon after the surgery and the other half waited a couple of days. The researchers wanted to see if there was a difference in how many people got an infection where they had the surgery. They found that there wasn't a big difference between the two groups. This means that it's not clear if taking a shower soon after surgery is better or worse than waiting a
This text talks about a medicine called prednisone that is used to help people with a condition called neuropathy. One study showed that some people who took prednisone got better, but the study was not very good and one person who took the medicine died. Another study compared prednisone to another medicine called dexamethasone and found that they both worked about the same, but dexamethasone might cause less sleep problems and less swelling in the face. However, both medicines can have bad side effects if used for a long time. We need more research to know for sure which medicine is better and who will benefit
Some people did some studies to see if it's okay to have a check-up for asthma over the phone instead of going to the doctor's office. They looked at six studies with 2100 people, but only four of them had enough information to be useful. They found that people who had a phone check-up had about the same amount of asthma problems as people who went to the doctor's office. They also found that calling people to remind them to have a check-up helped more people get checked. But they don't know for sure if phone check-ups are as good as going to the doctor's office because they didn't have enough
Some people did research on how exercise can help kids with a type of arthritis called JIA. They looked at 16 studies, but only 3 of them were good enough to use. They found that exercise can help with things like being able to do things, feeling good, and being able to breathe well. But they didn't find enough proof that it really helps. They also didn't find any bad effects from exercise. They think more research is needed to know for sure if exercise is helpful for kids with JIA.
Scientists studied how well antibiotics work for people who are sick. They looked at 19 different studies with 2663 people. Some people were in the hospital and some were not. They found that antibiotics can help people who are not very sick, but the evidence is not very strong. They also found that older antibiotics that are not used anymore can help people who are very sick in the hospital. But, antibiotics did not help people who were very sick in the hospital and in the ICU. They did not find any big problems with using antibiotics, but more research is needed to see who should get antibiotics and who should not.
We looked at nine studies with 1414 people who ate whole grains or refined grains. We didn't find any studies that showed if eating whole grains helps your heart. All the studies looked at things that can affect your heart, like blood pressure and cholesterol. The studies were not very good because they were short and had few people in them. Some of the studies were paid for by companies that sell cereal. We need better studies to know if eating whole grains is good for your heart.
This is a report about different ways to help people who have hurt their ankle bones. The report looked at 38 studies with almost 1900 people. Only one study was really good, and most of the others had problems. Some studies looked at ways to help people who didn't need surgery, and some looked at ways to help people who did need surgery. For people who didn't need surgery, there wasn't much evidence to show what helped the most. A few small studies showed that using a special kind of brace or doing hypnosis didn't really help. For people who did need surgery, some studies showed that using
There were four studies that looked at ways to help kids take their medicine for HIV. Two studies were done in poor countries. Two studies had some kids try a new way to take their medicine, while the other two studies did not. One study had nurses visit kids at home to help them take their medicine. This study showed that the kids knew more about their medicine and got more refills, but it did not change their CD4 count or viral load. Another study gave caregivers a diary to write down when the kids took their medicine. This study showed that the kids whose caregivers used the diary missed fewer doses, but it did not change
This is a study about medicine that helps people who have pain after surgery. The study looked at different doses of the medicine and compared it to a fake medicine called a placebo. The medicine is called fenoprofen and some people took different amounts of it, while others took a different medicine called zomepirac, morphine, or codeine. The study found that taking 200 mg of fenoprofen helped reduce pain for at least 4 to 6 hours. This medicine was safe and did not cause any serious problems. However, we don't know if other doses or medicines work as well or if they are safe.
This is a study about a treatment called PFMT for a problem called prolapse. Six tests were done, and three of them were new. Four of the tests had only a few women in them, and two of them were not very fair. In four of the tests, they compared PFMT to doing nothing, and in two of them, they compared PFMT to surgery. In the tests where they compared PFMT to doing nothing, they found that PFMT helped more than doing nothing. In the tests where they compared PFMT to surgery, they found that PFMT helped some people, but not everyone. They need to do
This text is talking about a study that looked at different treatments for ear infections. The study found that using a type of medicine called quinolone antibiotics can help clear up the infection better than not using any medicine or using a different type of medicine called antiseptics. The study also found that it's not clear if quinolone antibiotics are better than other types of antibiotics. The study didn't have a lot of information about how safe the medicines are. The researchers think more studies should be done to find out which medicines work best and are safest for treating ear infections.
We looked at 21 studies with over 6000 people to see if a test called FRS can help diagnose schizophrenia. Most of the studies were done a long time ago. We found that FRS can correctly identify people with schizophrenia about 75% to 95% of the time. But sometimes it can be wrong and say someone has schizophrenia when they don't, or say someone doesn't have it when they do. So, it's important to use FRS along with other tests and to be careful when diagnosing someone with schizophrenia. We hope that newer tests will be better, but for now, FRS is still helpful
We looked at 10 different studies about how to help kids with a skin condition called atopic eczema. Some of the studies taught kids and their families about how to take care of their skin, and some used therapy to help them feel better. Most of the studies showed that these extra things helped the kids feel better and have less severe skin problems. But some of the studies weren't done very well, so we need more research to be sure. We also need to figure out the best way to teach kids and their families how to take care of their skin and feel better.
This is a review of 14 experiments with 753 people. They found that using HBOT (a type of treatment) can help with some problems caused by radiation in certain parts of the body. It can help with things like wounds and tooth sockets healing better. But it doesn't seem to help with problems in the brain or nerves. More research is needed to figure out who should get this treatment and when.
We looked at 10 studies where doctors used either sharp or blunt needles during surgery. Four studies were about closing up the belly, two were about delivering babies, two were about fixing the vagina, and two were about replacing hips. When doctors used sharp needles, they poked holes in their gloves about once every three surgeries. But when they used blunt needles, they only poked holes in their gloves about once every six surgeries. Blunt needles also caused fewer injuries to the doctors. Even though blunt needles are harder to use, they are still okay to use. We are very sure that using blunt needles is safer for doctors and their helpers
This is a study that looked at two different types of medicine for people with mental health problems. The study had 422 people in it and lasted between 4 and 52 weeks. The study found that one medicine called trifluoperazine was not better than the other medicine in helping people feel better. Both medicines had about the same number of people who stopped taking them early. However, the trifluoperazine medicine caused more problems with movement like shaking or being uncoordinated. The study didn't look at other things like if the medicine made people sleepy or if it helped them have a better life. The study wasn't the best
We looked at nine studies that involved 593 babies who were born too early. These studies compared two ways of feeding the babies: one where they were fed when they showed signs of being hungry, and one where they were fed at set times. The studies were not perfect because they didn't always do everything the best way. When we looked at all the information from the studies, we found that babies who were fed when they showed signs of being hungry gained weight a little bit slower, but they were able to start eating on their own faster. However, we're not completely sure if this is important because the studies didn't show a big
This is a review of two studies that looked at how folic acid and a vitamin B supplement affect blood flow in people with a disease called peripheral arterial disease. One study showed that folic acid helped improve blood flow, but the other study did not show a difference. No one died or lost a limb during the studies. However, more studies are needed to know for sure if these treatments are helpful.
Two studies were done to see if paying dentists differently would change how they take care of their patients. The studies looked at over 800 dentists and 4,700 patients. The studies found that paying dentists more money for doing certain things made them do those things more often. But the studies were only done in a few places, so we don't know if it would work everywhere. The studies didn't look at how healthy the patients' teeth were or how much it cost. We need more studies to see if paying dentists differently is a good idea.
We looked at 21 studies that involved over 17,000 women and their babies. We found that taking zinc during pregnancy can slightly reduce the chance of having a baby too early. However, it did not seem to help with having a baby that is too small. We did not see any other big differences between the groups of women who took zinc and those who did not. The studies were mostly done with women who did not have a lot of money, and it might be helpful for them. But, it is more important to make sure that pregnant women have good nutrition overall, instead of just taking zinc.
Scientists studied how probiotics can help people who have a fungal infection. They looked at ten different studies with over 1,600 people. None of the studies were paid for by drug companies. All of the studies used probiotics along with medicine to treat the infection. The scientists found that probiotics helped people get better in the short term and reduced the chance of the infection coming back after a month. However, probiotics did not help people get better in the long term. They also did not cause any serious problems. The scientists think more studies are needed to learn more about how probiotics can help people with fungal infections.
We looked at seven different studies with almost 700 people to see if using a medicine called progestogen can help prevent miscarriages. The studies were done in different countries, some rich and some not as rich. We found that using progestogen can help lower the risk of miscarriage when taken by mouth or as a shot, but it might not help as much when used as a cream. We're not sure if using progestogen can help prevent birth defects because we don't have enough information. Overall, progestogen might be helpful in preventing miscarriages, but we need more research to be sure.
We looked at a lot of studies about using lasers to treat eye problems caused by diabetes. We found five studies that compared using lasers to not using any treatment. These studies were done in the USA, UK, and Japan and included almost 5,000 people. Four of the studies used a type of laser called argon laser on people with a certain type of eye problem, and one study used a different type of laser on people with a different type of eye problem. The studies showed that using lasers reduced the risk of severe vision loss and helped slow down the eye problem caused by diabetes. However, the studies did not look at things
We looked at two studies with 269 people who had trouble breathing after surgery on their stomachs. Most of the people were men and around 65 years old. The studies were done in China and Italy. We found that using a machine called CPAP or bilevel NPPV instead of just giving oxygen might help people breathe better and not need a tube in their throat as much. It might also help them leave the hospital sooner. We don't know if it helps with other problems like infections or bleeding. One study showed that bilevel NPPV might help improve blood levels. We need more studies to be sure if this is
We looked at four different tests that involved 388 women who might have had some problems. They tried different ways to help with pain, but the results were too different to put together. Three tests compared one medicine called diazepam to other medicines for making people sleep during surgery. One test compared two ways to help with pain during forceps delivery. The women who got spinal pain relief said it worked better and they had less pain during delivery. We don't know if any of the medicines or methods had bad effects on the moms or babies. One medicine called diazepam made women less likely to throw up. We don't know which
We looked at 15 studies with over 1000 people who have asthma. Most of the studies were done in India, Europe, and the United States. The people in the studies were mostly adults who had asthma for a long time. Some studies looked at just breathing exercises, while others looked at breathing, posture, and meditation. The studies lasted from two weeks to 54 months. We found that doing yoga might help people with asthma feel better and use less medicine. It might also improve their quality of life. We didn't find any bad side effects from doing yoga. But we need more studies to be sure that yoga is helpful
This is a report about different treatments for a muscle disease called IBM. The report looked at 10 different studies with 249 people. Some studies used one medicine and others used a combination of medicines. The main thing they were looking at was whether the medicines helped people's muscles get stronger after six months. Two studies showed that one medicine did not make a big difference compared to a fake medicine. One study showed that another medicine did not stop the disease from getting worse after a year. Some studies had too little information to say if the medicines worked or not. Some studies had side effects, but only one study looked at them closely. The
This is a report about a medicine called linezolid that can help people with infections. The report looked at nine studies with over 3000 people. Linezolid was better than another medicine called vancomycin at curing infections caused by a type of bacteria called MRSA. People who took linezolid had fewer side effects like redness, itching, and rashes, but more people had low platelet counts and felt sick to their stomachs. People who took linezolid also spent less time in the hospital and it cost less for them to get treatment outside of the hospital. However, the studies were paid for by the
We looked at eight studies with 512 people to see which surgery was better. We found that both surgeries had similar results for how many people died, how long they lived, and how sick they were after surgery. But one surgery, called PPW, was better for some things like how long the surgery took and how much blood was lost. However, the evidence we found was not very strong. We need more studies to be sure which surgery is better.
This is a study about a medicine called calcium channel blockers for people who have had a head injury. The study looked at six different tests with 1862 people. The study found that it is not clear if the medicine helps or hurts people with head injuries. In some cases, the medicine seemed to help, but in other cases, it caused problems. More research is needed to know for sure if this medicine is helpful or not.
We looked at four studies with a total of 3090 people. Three of the studies were pretty good, but one was not as good. We compared two ways of helping people who had a heart attack outside of the hospital. One way was to do CPR for a little bit before using a machine to shock the heart back to normal. The other way was to use the machine right away. We found that both ways were about the same for helping people survive and not have problems with their brain. We need more studies to be sure which way is better.
Scientists did a study to see which way of helping women get pregnant works best. They looked at 15 different ways, but only 3 of them were good enough to use. They found that one way helped more babies be born, but it was harder for the women because they had to take more medicine. Another way was easier for the women, but they didn't get as many eggs. One way had more problems and had to be stopped more often. They couldn't say for sure which way was the best because they need more information.
This is a report about how helping families can make a difference for people with schizophrenia. The report looked at 53 different studies and found that when families get involved, it can help reduce the number of times a person gets sick again (called relapse) and the number of times they have to go to the hospital. It can also help them remember to take their medicine. However, it doesn't seem to make a big difference in whether or not they stay in care. The report also found that family intervention can improve how well the family gets along and how they talk to each other. The report didn't find any evidence that family intervention
This is a study about a treatment for a problem in the leg arteries. The treatment uses a special balloon with medicine on it. The study looked at three different trials with a total of 263 people. The trials were done in Germany and Austria. Two companies made the special balloons. The study looked at how well the treatment worked and if there were any problems. The study found that the treatment helped with some problems, like the arteries getting narrow again. But the study was not very certain about the results because there were not enough people in the study. More studies are needed to know for sure if this treatment is good for people with this
This study looked at how a medicine called corticosteroids can help kids with a heart problem called Kawasaki disease. They looked at seven different tests with 922 kids. They found that the medicine helped reduce the heart problem and didn't cause any bad side effects. The medicine also helped kids get better faster and leave the hospital sooner. They need to do more tests to see if some kids benefit more than others. The study shows that doctors should consider giving this medicine to all kids with Kawasaki disease until they know more.
We looked at eight studies with 846 people who were randomly chosen to participate. Some studies compared a program called PIP to other treatments, while others compared it to no treatment at all. The people in the studies were women who had postpartum depression, were anxious or insecure, were maltreated, or were in prison. We checked to make sure the studies were fair and unbiased. Some studies showed that PIP helped babies feel more secure with their parents, but there was no difference in how parents felt or how they interacted with their babies. We need more research to know if PIP is really helpful for parents and babies.
We looked at some studies about giving extra oxygen to women who are having a baby through surgery. We found 11 studies with 753 people. We found that giving extra oxygen did not make a big difference in how the baby was doing right after birth. None of the studies reported any problems with the mom's breathing. We did find that giving extra oxygen made the mom's and baby's blood have more oxygen in it. But we're not sure if this is good or bad because the studies were not very good quality. Overall, we don't have enough evidence to say if giving extra oxygen is helpful or harmful during surgery to have a
We looked at twelve studies with information from 2196 people. Four of these studies were new in 2011. We found that using special packaging that reminds people to take their medicine helped them take more of their pills. However, different studies had different results. We also found that using this special packaging helped lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels in some people. One study showed that people who had trouble reading liked the special packaging. We need more research to make sure this kind of packaging works well for everyone.
We looked at 15 different tests that studied 11 different medicines. The tests were not very fair because they had some problems. We found that none of the medicines made a big difference in how many people died or got sick after surgery. One medicine called trimetazidine made people stay in the hospital for less time. Some of the medicines helped the liver work better and some helped protect the liver from getting hurt. But we need more tests to be sure if these medicines are really helpful. So, doctors should only use these medicines in more tests before using them on patients.
We looked at 61 studies about how cancer treatments can affect the kidneys. Some studies had different results because they looked at different types of cancer, treatments, and how long people were followed. Some studies found that some cancer treatments can cause kidney problems like not working well or leaking protein. Some studies found that certain treatments like radiation or surgery can increase the risk of kidney problems. We need more studies to understand this better. For now, doctors should check the kidneys and blood pressure of people who had cancer treatments.
This is a study about two different medicines for people with sickle cell disease. One medicine called Niprisan® helped reduce the number of times people had really bad pain for six months. It didn't seem to help with other problems or make things worse. The other medicine called Ciklavit® might help with pain, but we need more studies to be sure. Both medicines seem safe, but we need more studies to know for sure if they work well and are safe.
We looked at a lot of information and found three studies that involved almost 2000 people. The studies were about treating a type of cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two of the studies compared a treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to a treatment with just chemotherapy. The third study was more complicated and looked at different groups of people. We found that the people who got the treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation did better than the people who only got chemotherapy. We don't know yet if there are any long-term side effects from these treatments. We need more studies to find out if this treatment is the best one for everyone with Hodgkin's
We looked at 31 studies about birth control. In 2014, no new studies were added. Some studies looked at different types of birth control like pills, injections, and rings. None of the studies used a fake pill. Out of 34 comparisons, only 8 showed any differences between the groups. Some studies looked at a specific type of pill called desogestrel, but the differences from other pills were not consistent. Some studies showed that certain types of birth control affected blood sugar levels differently. However, we need more studies to be sure. Many of the studies had few participants or didn't report their methods well.
We looked at 10 studies about exercise for people with hip pain. Seven of the studies were good, but some of the results might not be completely accurate because the people in the studies knew which treatment they were getting. Exercise helped reduce pain and improve movement right after treatment. It also helped reduce pain for at least three to six months after treatment. Exercise did not seem to improve quality of life, but it did not cause any major problems. Overall, exercise can help people with hip pain feel better and move better.
Exercise can help people with MS feel better. Some studies looked at how exercise helped people compared to not exercising. The studies showed that exercise helped people with their muscles, being able to do things, and feeling happier. There was no evidence that exercise made people feel worse. It's important for future studies to use the same measurements and compare different types of exercise.
This is a study about two different ways to remove a sick gallbladder. One way is to have surgery right away, and the other way is to wait a few months before having surgery. The study found that people who had surgery right away had fewer problems during the waiting time, like getting sick again or having to go to the hospital. They also spent less time in the hospital and had a shorter surgery. However, this study only looked at one group of people and there needs to be more studies to make sure this is the best way to do things.
This is a review of 11 studies about using antibiotics to prevent infections after a certain type of surgery. Some of the studies were not very clear, so the quality of the evidence is not as good. Seven of the studies showed that taking antibiotics for a long time probably reduces the risk of infection after surgery. It's not clear if taking antibiotics for a short time or just one dose is as effective. None of the studies showed any bad side effects from the antibiotics. We don't know if one type of antibiotic is better than another. Overall, taking antibiotics for a long time can help prevent infections after this type of surgery.
We looked at one study with 40 babies and 42 moms. The study wasn't big enough to tell if it was better to have a baby early or wait until the due date for babies with a certain problem called gastroschisis. We found that there were no big differences between the two groups of babies. Two babies in the early group died, but none in the other group. Some moms had a surgery called a c-section, but it was about the same in both groups. We also looked at other things like how much the babies weighed and if they needed help breathing, but there weren't any big differences. We can
We looked at three studies in grown-ups that lasted up to one week. 122 people were chosen at random to be in the studies, but only 95 finished. We didn't find any studies in kids. All three studies used paracetamol with other medicines to help with pain. The studies were too small and had some problems, so we can't be sure if paracetamol really helps with pain. We also don't know if it's safe to use with other medicines. We need more studies to know for sure if paracetamol is helpful for pain.
Scientists did some experiments in China to see if certain medicines could help people who wet the bed. They looked at 15 different experiments, but the way they reported the results was not very good and some important information was missing. They found that some medicines worked better than others, but some of them could also be dangerous if taken in too high of a dose. They also found that some Chinese medicine and a type of oil might be helpful, but they need to do more experiments to be sure. Overall, they need to do more research to know for sure which medicines work best.
We looked at six studies with 195 people who have MS. Some people did breathing exercises with a special device that made it harder to breathe in or out. Others did regular breathing exercises. A few people dropped out, but no one got hurt. We found that the people who did the special breathing exercises did not have much difference in how strong they could breathe in or out compared to those who did not do the exercises. But, the people who did the special breathing exercises did have a little bit of improvement in how strong they could breathe in. We don't know if this improvement will last or if it will make their life better.
This is a review of a study that looked at a medicine called betamethasone for pregnant women with a condition called ITP. The study had 38 women, but only 26 were looked at. The study found that betamethasone did not make a big difference in the risk of babies having low platelets or bleeding. The study did not look at other things like maternal death or bleeding after birth. The review says that there is not enough evidence to say if betamethasone is a good treatment for ITP during pregnancy. More studies are needed to find out if it is safe and helpful.
We looked at two studies from Iran that had 111 people with a problem called keratoconus. They were split into two groups and given different surgeries. One group had more problems during the surgery and some people had to stop. Both groups had some problems after the surgery, but they were treated with medicine. We found that the group that had one type of surgery was less likely to have a problem with their body rejecting the new part. But we don't have enough information to say which surgery is better overall. We need more studies to find out.
This is a report about a study on iron supplements for women. They looked at a lot of information and found that taking iron supplements can help women have more iron in their blood and be less likely to be anemic. Anemia means not having enough healthy red blood cells. They also found that taking iron supplements can help women do better in exercise and feel less tired. But, taking iron supplements can also cause some stomach problems like diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Overall, taking iron supplements can be helpful for women, but it can also cause some side effects.
This is a review of five studies that looked at how well a certain treatment worked for 1,726 patients. They found that the treatment did not lower the chance of dying from any cause, but it did help people live longer without their disease getting worse. However, the evidence for this is not very strong because the studies had some limitations. The treatment also had some side effects like diarrhea and hair loss. The researchers think that more studies are needed to understand if this treatment is really helpful.
Doctors did a study to see which way of cutting the skin during surgery is better. They found that cutting across or at an angle is less likely to cause problems with breathing and the cut is less likely to open up. It might also hurt less. Both ways of cutting take the same amount of time to heal and have the same risks for other problems. The way the doctor chooses to cut is up to them.
We looked at nine studies with almost 1,000 people who had back pain. Most of the studies were done in Europe and North America. People in the studies who got a special kind of treatment called MBR had less pain and were more likely to go back to work than people who got regular care. But when we compared MBR to other treatments, we didn't see much of a difference. We need more studies to know for sure if MBR is the best treatment for back pain.
We looked at 18 studies with 4843 people to see if a medicine called bisphosphonate helps with pain and other problems in people with prostate cancer that has spread to their bones. We found that bisphosphonate did not make a big difference in pain, but it did help prevent bone problems and disease from getting worse. However, it can also cause nausea and kidney problems. We couldn't tell if it made a difference in quality of life. More studies are needed to look at this.
We looked at a lot of information and found five studies that involved over a thousand patients. These studies looked at using stem cell transplants to treat a type of cancer called follicular lymphoma. We found that using stem cell transplants helped patients with this cancer stay free of the disease for longer, but it did not necessarily make them live longer. There were some side effects, like infections and problems with blood cells, but they were not very common. We need more studies to be sure, but it looks like using stem cell transplants could be a good way to treat this type of cancer.
We looked at 15 studies with 1437 people who have schizophrenia. We found that a type of treatment called WDD can help improve how people feel in the short-term compared to doing nothing or taking a fake pill. When we compared WDD to other medicines for schizophrenia, we didn't see a big difference in how people felt. But, WDD caused fewer bad side effects. When WDD was used with other medicines, it helped people feel better and caused fewer bad side effects. We need more studies to be sure if WDD is a good treatment for people with schizophrenia.
We looked at some studies about braces. We found three new studies and now we have 12 studies with 799 people. Some studies were good and some were not so good. None of the studies talked about teeth getting damaged. We looked at six different types of braces. We found that one type of brace made teeth move more than another type. We also found that one type of brace did not cause more pain than another type. But we don't know if one type of brace is better than another for making teeth straight or for causing pain or damage.
This is a report about a study that was done in France with 306 older people who have dementia. The study looked at how their behavior changed when they were given a special kind of care. The study used three different scales to measure their behavior. The study found that the people who got the special care had better behavior in some areas, like not being physically or verbally aggressive. But the study was not very good because it had some problems, so we need more research to know for sure if this kind of care is helpful.
We looked at 13 studies with 1316 people who had trouble controlling their pee or poop. They lived in a nursing home or were in the hospital. Most of the studies were small and didn't last very long. We couldn't combine the information from all the studies because they were too different. Some studies tested different skin care products, like soap or moisturizer. Two studies showed that using a special washcloth with soap, moisturizer, and protection was better than just using soap and water. Another study showed that using a skin cleanser was better than using soap and water. Using moisturizer or skin protectant might also help
We looked at seven studies with 333 people to see if antiviral medicine helps with a sickness called IM. Some people were in the hospital and some were at home. The medicine and how long they took it was different in each study. The medicine names were acyclovir, valomaciclovir, and valacyclovir. We found that the medicine helped a little bit with some symptoms, but not all. We also found that some people had side effects from the medicine. We need more research to know if this medicine is helpful or not.
This is a review of four studies that looked at two different types of insulin, called insulin detemir and insulin glargine. The studies lasted between 24 and 52 weeks and involved 2250 people. The studies found that both types of insulin worked about the same to control blood sugar levels. However, insulin detemir was often given twice a day and in a higher dose, while insulin glargine was given once a day and caused fewer injection site reactions. Insulin detemir also caused less weight gain. The studies did not look at things like quality of life, costs, or mortality.
Scientists did some experiments to see if a special device called SNS can help people who have trouble controlling their poop (called faecal incontinence) or trouble going poop (called constipation). They did six experiments where people used SNS for faecal incontinence and two experiments for constipation. In one experiment, 53 people with faecal incontinence who used SNS had fewer accidents than people who didn't use it. Some people had pain or tingling in their private parts, but it wasn't too bad. In another experiment, 15 people with faecal incontinence who used SNS had fewer accidents
This text talks about two experiments that looked at how well different things worked to keep braces on teeth. The experiments showed that using molar bands (a type of brace) worked better than using molar tubes (another type of brace). The molar bands were put on with a special kind of cement called glass ionomer cement, while the molar tubes were put on with a different kind of cement. The experiments also showed that the molar bands caused less damage to the teeth than the molar tubes. However, more experiments are needed to be sure.
We looked at 66 articles about stomach cancer that were written between 1988 and 2012. We found information about 7,747 patients who had a test called EUS to see how far their cancer had spread. We found that EUS is pretty good at telling if the cancer is in the early stages or if it has spread a lot. But, we also found that EUS is not as good at telling if the cancer is in the top layer of the stomach or the layer below it, or if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. We need to be careful when we use EUS to diagnose stomach cancer
Doctors did some tests on people who had problems with their gallbladder. They looked at six different tests that had some problems with them. They looked at 492 people who had surgery to take out their gallbladder. Some people went home the same day and some stayed overnight. Most of the people in the tests were women and were between 40 and 47 years old. They found that there was no difference in how safe the surgery was between the two groups. They also found that there was no difference in how much pain people had or how long it took them to go back to work. They need to do more tests to
We looked at eight studies with 2488 people to see if a medicine called capsaicin helps with pain. Most of the studies were good, but one was not so good. Some people got a fake medicine called a placebo, and others got capsaicin. We found that capsaicin helped more people with pain from shingles, HIV, and diabetes than the fake medicine. But not everyone felt better with capsaicin. Some people had side effects like redness or burning where they put the medicine. We need to be careful when we look at these results because the studies were not perfect. But for
We did a study with over 6000 people to see if surgery helps prevent strokes. We looked at three different ways to measure the problem and did some math to compare them. We found that surgery helps people with a lot of blockage in their arteries, but it doesn't help people with a little bit of blockage or almost no blockage. We also found that surgery is better for people who have symptoms.
This text talks about a study that looked at two different ways of making a hole in the stomach to help people go to the bathroom. One way is called "lateral pararectal" and the other is called "transrectal." The study found that it's not clear which way is better for preventing a problem called "parastomal herniation." They also looked at other problems, but there wasn't enough information to say if one way was better than the other. The study shows that more research is needed to figure out the best way to do this kind of surgery.
Some people did a study to see if a type of therapy called "supportive therapy" is good for helping people with mental health problems. They looked at 24 studies with over 2000 people. They found that supportive therapy is not better than other types of therapy for things like going back to the hospital or how well people can do things in their daily life. But, they did find that other types of therapy can be better for things like going back to the hospital and feeling better mentally. They need to do more research to know for sure which therapy is the best.
Eleven studies were done to see if medicine could help people with pain. Almost 1,000 people with bad pain were picked randomly to be in the studies, but not all of them finished. Some studies gave people medicine without them knowing what it was, some studies gave people medicine with them knowing what it was, and one study told people what medicine they were getting. None of the studies compared medicine to a fake medicine. Most of the studies were not done perfectly, so we can't be sure if the results are true. None of the studies looked at our main questions, which were if the medicine helped people's pain a lot
Two studies were done with 287 people. One study had 253 people and found that a medicine called tinzaparin helped reduce pain faster than a fake medicine. People who took tinzaparin also spent less time in the hospital. There were two minor bleeding events in the tinzaparin group. The second study had 34 people and found that another medicine called dalteparin helped reduce pain after one day. However, the quality of evidence was not very good because the studies were small and had some problems. We need more studies to know if these medicines are really helpful for people with sickle cell disease.
We looked at a lot of studies about two kinds of medicine that help people with a problem in their neck. We found that both medicines are about the same in how well they work. We did not find any studies that compared these medicines to doing nothing. We also did not find any studies that compared the two medicines directly. Some people had bleeding problems when they took one of the medicines, but we are not sure if it was because of the medicine or just a coincidence. So, we don't have enough evidence to say which medicine is better for this problem.
We looked at 26 studies with 2066 patients to see if silver helps wounds heal and prevents infections. We couldn't combine the results because the treatments and outcomes were different in each study. For burns, some studies showed that silver helped prevent infections, but others showed that it caused more infections than non-silver treatments. For other types of wounds, most studies showed no difference between silver and non-silver treatments in preventing infections. Only one study showed that a silver-containing dressing helped wounds heal faster in diabetic foot ulcers. We don't have enough evidence to say for sure if silver helps wounds heal or prevents infections.
We looked at 12 studies with 3571 people to see which medicine works best for treating adults with a lung infection called VAP. Some studies didn't tell us everything we needed to know, and some were paid for by drug companies. We found that using one medicine or a combination of medicines didn't make a big difference in how many people got better or worse. We also found that one type of medicine called carbapenems might work better than others. But we don't know for sure which medicine is the best because we didn't have enough studies to compare them. Overall, using just one medicine is safe and works well
We looked at 29 studies about rules for medicine. Some rules made it harder to get certain medicines, and some made it easier. The studies showed that when rules were made for certain types of medicine, people used less of those medicines and saved money. This was especially true for medicines that help with stomach problems and pain. When rules were made for other types of medicine, it didn't work as well. Sometimes people stopped taking their medicine or had to go to the doctor more often. When rules were relaxed for certain medicines, people used them more and saved money. But it's important to make sure the rules are based on research and
Nineteen studies were looked at to see if using special things to clean your teeth (called OHA) helped improve oral health. A total of 4232 people were in these studies. The studies were different from each other and it was hard to combine the information. The studies were put into groups to compare them. The first group compared using OHA to not using it. Two studies showed that using OHA helped reduce plaque on teeth. Another group compared using personalized OHA to regular OHA. There was not enough evidence to show that personalized OHA was better. Another group compared doing OHA by yourself to having a
This is a study about how medicine can help people with a shoulder problem called adhesive capsulitis. The study looked at five different trials with different types of medicine and treatments. Some of the trials were good and some were not so good. One trial showed that oral steroids (medicine you take by mouth) helped people feel better in the short term, but the benefits didn't last past six weeks. Another trial showed that oral steroids didn't make a big difference in pain or movement compared to a fake medicine called a placebo. A third trial showed that oral steroids helped people feel better faster than doing nothing, but the benefits didn't last past
Scientists did three tests with 50 people to see if a treatment called rTMS works for people with ALS. They compared rTMS to a fake treatment called sham TMS. The tests were not done very well and some people dropped out, which makes the results less reliable. They couldn't find enough information to see if rTMS helped people with ALS after six months. One test showed that rTMS didn't work better than the fake treatment after 12 months. They didn't see any bad side effects from rTMS, but they need to do more tests to make sure it's safe. Right now, they
We looked at 10 different studies with over 1000 people. They were testing different ways to treat a disease called BP. One study found that using plasma exchange and prednisone together worked better than just using prednisone. But another study didn't find a difference after 6 months. They also looked at different doses of prednisone and other medicines, but didn't find any big differences. They found that using a strong cream called clobetasol works well for BP, but it can have side effects. Using a milder cream is safer for people with less severe BP. They also found that using a lower dose
Scientists studied 75 different tests with 7957 people who have a stomach problem called irritable bowel syndrome. They looked at how well herbal medicines worked compared to regular medicine or fake medicine. They found that some herbal medicines helped people feel better, but not all of them worked well. Some herbal medicines worked even better when they were used with regular medicine. No one got really sick from taking the herbal medicines. But, we need to be careful because some of the tests were not done very well. We need to do more tests to see which herbal medicines work the best.
We looked at 22 studies that tested using a medicine called LNG to prevent pregnancy. Over 12,000 people in Europe, Asia, and the Americas were in the studies. The medicine was either LNG or other hormones. We looked at how well the medicine worked, if people stopped using it, if there were side effects, and if people liked it. The medicine worked pretty well and was safe. The most common side effect was changes in periods. But most people still liked using the medicine even with these changes. We need more research to be sure it's a good way to prevent pregnancy for people who don't have sex very often
This update has new information from 14 studies, making a total of 15 studies with information from 561 patients. The studies were done in different countries and most of the patients were young. Some studies had more girls than boys. Some studies were not done very well, but one study was done well. The studies compared two ways of fixing teeth and found that one way was better at keeping teeth in place. They did not find any bad effects from either way of fixing teeth.
We looked at 50 studies with over 45,000 people who have kidney problems. Some studies compared a medicine called statins to a fake pill or no medicine, and some studies compared different types of statins. We found that statins can help prevent heart problems and death in people with kidney problems who do not have heart problems yet. Statins did not seem to cause many bad side effects, but we need more information to be sure.
We looked at a lot of information and found nine studies that had 379 kids with cerebral palsy or brittle bones. The kids were between 2 and 19 years old. Most of the studies tested different medicines to see if they helped with pain. Some of the studies found that the medicine helped, but some didn't. Some kids had side effects like swelling or seizures from the medicine. We need more studies to know which medicines work best for kids with these conditions.
Scientists looked at seven different studies with a total of 1697 people. They found that six of the studies had good information to use. Three of the studies looked at how well the medicine worked, and four of the studies looked at how safe the medicine was. They found that five of the studies might not have been completely fair, and three of the studies might not have had all the information they needed. They found that the medicine might help with some behavior problems, but it did not seem to help with memory or daily activities. They also found that the medicine did not seem to cause more problems than a fake medicine. However, they
We looked at seven different studies with 735 people to see if a treatment called RIC could help prevent or treat a type of stroke called ischaemic stroke. We checked to make sure the studies were done fairly. We found that RIC might help prevent another stroke in people with a certain type of blockage in their brain, but it might not help prevent stroke in people getting a certain type of surgery. RIC might also make stroke worse in some people getting a certain type of treatment. We also found that RIC might cause some side effects, but they were not too serious. However, we need more studies to be sure
We looked at six studies that involved 204 babies who were born too early. We found that adding extra protein to their milk helped them grow faster while they were in the hospital. They gained more weight, grew longer, and had bigger heads. But, they had to stay in the hospital longer and had higher levels of a substance called blood urea nitrogen. We don't know if adding protein to their milk caused any other problems or if it helped them in the long run. We need more studies to find out.
This is a report about 45 studies that looked at how well something called PEM works. Most of the studies compared PEM to doing nothing. Only one study compared PEM on paper to the same thing on a computer. The studies found that PEMs may help professionals do their jobs a little better, but we don't know if it helps patients. We also don't know if PEMs are better than other ways of helping professionals do their jobs.
This text talks about a study that looked at different ways to teach young women about staying safe during sex. They looked at 23 different studies that were done in the USA, mostly in health clinics. The studies taught things like using condoms and talking about sex. Some studies gave out free resources like health services. The studies were different in how long they lasted and what they focused on. They looked at different sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like HIV and chlamydia, but not HPV or cervical cancer. Some studies showed that teaching about safe sex helped people use condoms more often, but not everyone. They didn't find that teaching
We looked at 20 studies with 2337 people to see if a short lesson about mental health (called brief psychoeducation) helped them take their medicine and feel better. 19 studies compared the lesson to regular care, and 1 study compared it to a different type of therapy. People who got the lesson were more likely to take their medicine in the short and medium term, and had fewer relapses in the medium term. They also had better social function and less anxiety and depression. We need more studies to know for sure if this lesson is helpful.
We looked at 11 studies with almost 10,000 people who have a breathing problem called COPD. Most of the studies were sponsored by drug companies, which means they might not be completely fair. One study was the biggest and had the most people in it. It only included people who had a recent bad flare-up of their breathing problem. Some studies included people with different levels of COPD. We followed up with the people in the studies for 6 to 52 weeks. We found that a certain type of medicine called LAMA+LABA helped people with COPD have fewer flare-ups, breathe better, and have a
This is a report about using a gas called heliox to help kids with a sickness called croup. The report talks about three studies that were done with a total of 91 kids between 6 months and 4 years old. The studies were done in emergency rooms in the USA and Spain. In one study, heliox was compared to oxygen for 20 minutes and there was no big difference between the two. In another study, heliox was given with medicine and it seemed to help the kids with croup for a short time. In the third study, heliox was compared to oxygen with medicine and it may have helped a
This text talks about a study that looked at how to find out if someone has a broken bone in their back when they have lower back pain. The study looked at different tests that doctors can use to find out if someone has a broken bone. They found that some tests are better than others, and that using a combination of tests is more helpful than just using one. They also found that some tests can give the wrong answer, so doctors need to be careful when using them. The study suggests that doctors should use a small group of tests together to find out if someone has a broken bone in their back.
There were two studies done to see which treatment is best for men with a problem called urethral stricture. In the first study, they compared two treatments for 210 men. They found that both treatments worked about the same and had similar results after three years. In the second study, they compared two treatments for 50 men who had a problem with their urethra after a pelvic injury. They found that the first treatment worked better in the first six months, but after two years, more men needed more treatment with the second treatment. They still don't know which treatment is best overall and more studies are needed to find out
Doctors did a study on kids and adults with asthma. They looked at two different ways to take medicine for asthma: taking it every day or only when you have symptoms. They found that both ways worked about the same for preventing bad asthma attacks and serious health problems. But taking medicine every day helped with lung function, asthma control, and using less medicine to relieve symptoms. Kids who took medicine every day grew a little less than kids who only took it when they had symptoms. Doctors say both ways are safe, but they need to study more to see if taking medicine only when you have symptoms is okay for a long time.
We looked at 17 studies with 1639 people who have kidney problems. Some people were on dialysis, some had a kidney transplant, and others had different stages of kidney problems. The studies looked at how different diets affected their health. Some diets included more fruits and vegetables, some had less iron, and some had more protein. We found that these diets might help lower blood pressure and improve kidney function, but we're not sure if they can prevent people from getting really sick or dying. We need more research to know for sure.
This is a study about how to help babies and young children who have trouble breathing because of bronchiolitis. They tested three different ways to help: using a machine to give medicine called nebulised salbutamol, using a machine to give just water called nebulised saline, and sitting in a tent with mist. They found that the nebulised salbutamol helped the most, but the mist and nebulised saline did not help as much. They did not talk about any bad effects from these treatments. Sometimes, people use mist therapy to help with bronchiolitis, but this study only looked at
We looked at four studies with over a thousand people who were between 50 and 90 years old. All of them had Alzheimer's disease and were taking medicine for it. We wanted to see if taking statin medicine would help them. We measured how well they could think and remember things before and after taking the medicine. We also looked at any bad effects from the medicine. When we looked at all the information together, we found that the statin medicine did not make a big difference in how well they could think or remember things. We also did not see any bad effects from the medicine. We think more studies are needed to see
Some people did some studies to see if wearing a special brace at night or taking medicine or having surgery could help people with certain muscle diseases move their ankles better. They found that the brace and medicine helped some things, but didn't make a big difference in ankle movement. The surgery helped at first, but after a while, the boys who had it had problems again. They need to do more research to find better ways to help people with these muscle diseases move their ankles better.
This is a study about how different positions during labor can affect the birth of a baby. The study found that when women were upright or walking during the first stage of labor, their labor was shorter by about one hour and 22 minutes. They were also less likely to have a C-section or need an epidural. Babies of mothers who were upright were also less likely to need special care after birth. However, the study says that the quality of the research was not always good, so more studies are needed to be sure. The study recommends that women in labor should be encouraged to try different positions and choose what feels best for them.
This is a report about a medical condition called TOS. The people who wrote the report had a hard time because there isn't a clear way to diagnose TOS. They looked at a few studies to see if different treatments helped people with TOS. One study showed that a surgery called TFRR helped more than another treatment called SNBP. Another study showed that a shot called BTX didn't help much with pain, but it did help with a feeling called paresthesias. There isn't enough evidence to say if any of these treatments are better than doing nothing. The people who wrote the report think that doctors need to agree
This is a study about different ways to help people with wrist pain. They looked at 21 different tests with 884 people. They found that wearing a brace on your hand helped with pain and movement after four weeks. They also found that taking steroids by mouth for two weeks helped with pain. Doing yoga for eight weeks helped with pain more than wearing a brace. Moving the bones in your wrist helped with pain after three weeks. Other things like magnets, laser acupuncture, exercise, and chiropractic care did not help with pain. They need to do more tests to see which treatments work best and how long they work for.
We looked at two studies that tested treatments for a problem called CRVO-ME. One study gave injections of a medicine called triamcinolone acetonide and the other study gave implants of a medicine called dexamethasone. Both studies had some problems with how they were done, like not having all the information or only reporting certain things. The people who got the treatments had some improvement in their eyesight, but they also had more side effects like high eye pressure and problems with their eyes. We can't say for sure if these treatments are good or bad because the studies didn't give us enough information.
Scientists did six different tests on 394 patients to see if a medicine called intranasal corticosteroids could help with stuffy noses and big adenoids. Five of the tests showed that the medicine worked well. In one test, the medicine called beclomethasone helped more than a fake medicine. In another test, 38% of patients who took beclomethasone had much less stuffy noses, but none of the patients who took the fake medicine did. In a third test, a medicine called mometasone helped 77.7% of patients with stuffy noses and big adenoids so
We looked at a small study with 24 women in Mexico. The study compared two groups of women. One group got medicine for high blood pressure, seizures, and other things. The other group got a shot in their back instead of the medicine. The shot had some medicine in it too. The study found that the shot did not make a big difference for the moms or babies. We need more studies to know if the shot is a good idea for moms with a serious problem called pre-eclampsia.
We looked at 16 studies about a medicine called glucocorticosteroids. Most of the studies were not very good because they had some problems. We looked at 15 of the studies, which had almost 1,900 people in them. Some people got the medicine and some people did not. The people were between 25 and 70 years old and had liver problems from drinking too much alcohol. We followed them for up to a year. We found that the medicine did not seem to help or hurt them. We are not sure because the studies were not very good. We need better studies to know for sure.
We looked at four different studies with 245 people to see if rehabilitation could help people drive better after having a stroke. The studies were done with people who were relatively young and had different types of rehabilitation. We found that there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if rehabilitation can help people drive better after a stroke. However, we did find that using a driving simulator might help people recognize road signs better. We need more studies to know for sure what kind of rehabilitation works best for people who have had a stroke and want to drive again.
This is a study about how long people with a lung problem called COPD should take medicine called corticosteroids when they have a flare-up. The study looked at 8 different groups of people with 582 participants. 5 of the groups were in hospitals and had 519 people. The people in the study were mostly older and mostly men. They all had severe or very severe COPD. The medicine was given for 3 to 7 days for short treatment or 10 to 15 days for longer treatment. Some people took pills and some got the medicine through a vein. The study found that taking the medicine for
We looked at some studies about giving blood to people with a certain kind of blood problem called MDS. We found one study with 13 people that looked at giving blood when the person's blood level was low (called a restrictive policy) or giving blood more often (called a liberal policy). We don't have enough information to know if one way is better than the other. The study didn't report any problems with the blood transfusions. But, we need more studies with more people to know the best way to give blood to people with MDS.
We looked at a lot of papers and found two that talked about using games to teach doctors and nurses. In the first study, they used a game based on a TV show to teach about stopping infections. The group that played the game did better on a test than the group that didn't play. In the second study, they compared a game about snakes and ladders to a regular lesson about preventing and treating strokes. Both groups did about the same on a test right after the lesson and three months later. But the group that played the game liked it more. We need more research to know if games are a good way to teach doctors
This text talks about a study that looked at how well a medicine called lithium works for people with a mood disorder called unipolar affective disorder. The study included 475 people and found that when people took lithium, they were less likely to have to go to the hospital because of their mood disorder. There were no other big differences between lithium and other medicines. Doctors and patients should think about the patient's history and how well they can follow the treatment plan when deciding which medicine to use. More studies are needed to learn more.
Two groups of sick people were studied to see if a medicine called Amifostine helped with their dry mouth, radiation treatment, and blood pressure. The medicine did not show any big differences compared to a fake medicine. Two people got sick from the medicine but got better. The studies did not look at if the medicine helped people feel better or if it cost a lot of money. The studies show that more research is needed to know if this medicine is helpful.
We looked at three studies that involved 45 kids with Down syndrome who were between 2 and 6 years old. The studies tested different ways to help the kids learn to talk better. Some of the kids got help from their parents and some got help from a doctor. The studies lasted from 3 months to 6 months. The studies found that the kids who got help could use more words and talk better in certain situations, but there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if the help made a big difference. The studies were small and not very well done, so we need more studies to know for sure if this kind of
We looked at two studies from a long time ago that had 148 people who had heart valve surgery. Both studies were not very good. We couldn't tell if doing exercise after surgery helped people live longer or not. We also couldn't tell if it caused any bad things to happen. The studies didn't talk about how people felt or how much it cost. We did find that people who did exercise after surgery could do more exercise than people who didn't. We couldn't tell if people could go back to work after 12 months. We need more studies to know if exercise after surgery is good for people.
This text talks about some studies that looked at how meditation and spiritual care can help people who are very sick. The studies found that meditation and spiritual care may or may not help people feel better. Some people who got massages and meditation felt better, but overall there wasn't a big difference between those who got spiritual care and those who didn't. The studies weren't perfect because they didn't give enough information about how they were done. We need more studies to know for sure if spiritual care can help sick people.
We did a study with 137 people to see if a treatment called tDCS helps people with Parkinson's disease. We found that tDCS did not seem to help with the main symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but it did seem to help with some of the movement problems. We also looked at how tDCS affected people's quality of life, but we didn't find enough evidence to say if it helped or not. We didn't find any evidence that tDCS caused any bad side effects. Overall, we need more research to know if tDCS is a good treatment for Parkinson's disease.
We looked at 12 studies about a treatment called LASB for a condition called CRPS. We found that the studies were not very good quality and did not show that LASB helped reduce pain. Some studies compared LASB to other treatments and found no difference. Some studies looked at LASB with rehabilitation treatment and found no extra benefit. There were some minor side effects reported. Overall, we don't have enough good evidence to say if LASB is helpful for CRPS.
This is a study about Bell's palsy, which is a condition that can make one side of your face weak or paralyzed. The study looked at different treatments to see which ones worked best. They found that a combination of antivirals and corticosteroids did not make much of a difference in helping people recover compared to just using corticosteroids. Corticosteroids alone were better than antivirals alone. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids did help reduce long-term problems like crocodile tears or muscle problems. They did not find any big differences in side effects between the treatments.
Two studies looked at using a medicine called leuprorelin to treat a type of cancer called EOC. One study compared it to another medicine called treosulfan, and the other compared it to a fake medicine called a placebo. The studies found that there may not be a big difference in how well the medicines work, but treosulfan may cause more hair loss and tiredness. The studies did not say much about how long people lived or how they felt. Overall, we need more research to know if leuprorelin is a good treatment for this type of cancer.
We looked at 17 studies about babies who had trouble breathing because they didn't have enough oxygen. In 10 of the studies, some babies got a special treatment called iNO and others didn't. The babies who got iNO did better and were less likely to need a machine to help them breathe. About half of the babies who got iNO had better oxygen levels. The treatment worked for babies who were born close to their due date and didn't have a certain problem with their diaphragm. But it didn't work as well for babies who did have that problem. The treatment didn't seem to cause any other problems for
This is a report about studies on how to prevent and treat low-back pain. Some people wore special belts called lumbar supports to see if they helped. The studies showed that it's not clear if these belts are better than doing nothing or other treatments. The studies also showed that some of the research wasn't very good quality. More studies are needed to find out if these belts really work and how to make sure people use them correctly.
We looked at a bunch of studies about tubes that go into people's bodies called catheters. Some of the catheters had medicine on them to help prevent infections. We found that the catheters with medicine on them helped reduce infections in the blood and on the catheter itself. But, we didn't see a big difference in how many people got really sick or died. We also found that the medicine on the catheter worked better in some places, like the ICU, than in other places. We need more studies to be sure if the medicine on the catheter is always a good idea.
This is a report about 15 studies that looked at ways to help babies and pregnant women who live in poor areas. Most of the studies were done in Bangladesh, India, and Peru. The studies tested different ways to give people more nutrients and teach them about good nutrition. Some studies gave pregnant women zinc supplements, some gave children nutrient supplements, and some taught pregnant women about nutrition. The studies found that teaching pregnant women about nutrition helped reduce the number of babies born with low birth weight. However, there was not enough evidence to show that the other interventions helped reduce stunting (when children are too short for their age). It is important
This is a study about different types of bandages used to help heal leg sores. The study looked at 12 different experiments with over 1,000 people. The results showed that foam bandages did not work better than other types of bandages in helping the sores heal. The study also found that some of the experiments were not done very well, so more research is needed to know for sure which bandages work best.
This is a study about two types of medicine called COX-2 inhibitors. Some of these medicines were taken off the market because they were not safe. The study looked at two other COX-2 inhibitors called etoricoxib and celecoxib to see if they were safe for people with a stomach problem called IBD. The study found that these medicines did not make the IBD worse, but the study was small and more research is needed to be sure. Some people had side effects like stomach problems, but no one had serious problems like heart attacks or kidney problems. Doctors need to be careful when giving these medicines to
We looked at 22 studies with over 2310 people to see which treatments work best for diabetic foot ulcers. Most studies had small groups of people and short follow-up times. Some studies only included people with infected ulcers. Different treatments were used, like dressings with silver or iodides. We found that using an antimicrobial dressing may help more ulcers heal than using a non-antimicrobial dressing. We also found that using topical antimicrobial treatments and systemic antibiotics have similar risks for side effects. We need more studies to know which treatments work best for preventing and treating infections in diabetic foot ulcers.
We looked at some studies about taking zinc to help with getting sick with pneumonia. We found six studies with over 5000 people that showed taking zinc can help reduce the chance of getting pneumonia by 13%. It can also help reduce how many people get pneumonia by 41%. When we looked closer, we found that taking zinc can help even more if the doctor checks your chest to confirm you have pneumonia. But it doesn't seem to help as much if the doctor just listens to your breathing. So, taking zinc can help kids not get pneumonia as much.
This is a review of ten studies that looked at whether taking vitamin A can help prevent getting sick with a certain type of illness called acute LRTI. Some studies found that taking vitamin A did not make a difference in getting sick or having symptoms, while others found that it actually made things worse. Two studies found that it helped some kids who were not eating enough, but made healthy kids more likely to get sick. So, doctors say that giving vitamin A to all kids to prevent this type of sickness is not a good idea. Vitamin A can help prevent other types of sickness, but it doesn't work well for this one. If
This text talks about a medicine called theophylline that can help people with a breathing problem called COPD. The medicine can make it easier for them to breathe and improve their oxygen levels. Some people may feel sick from taking it, but others prefer it over not taking anything. The medicine may also help people do better in exercise tests. The studies showed that not many people stopped taking the medicine because of side effects. However, the studies only included people who were already used to taking the medicine, so we don't know if it will work for everyone.
We looked at 10 studies that involved 439 kids who were allergic to eggs. Some of the kids got a treatment called oral immunotherapy, which helps them become less allergic to eggs. Other kids didn't get this treatment and just avoided eggs. We wanted to see if the treatment worked and if it was safe. Most kids who got the treatment could eat a little bit of egg without getting sick. But some kids had bad reactions and needed medicine to help them. We found that the treatment can help, but we need more studies to be sure it's safe for everyone.
We looked at four studies with 579 people to see if a device called an ILR helped with a problem called syncope (when people faint for no reason). We found that the ILR did not make a big difference in whether people lived or died in the long term. We don't know about short-term deaths. Two studies showed that the ILR helped doctors figure out what was causing the syncope, but it cost more money. We need more studies to see if the ILR helps with other things like quality of life and how often people faint.
We looked at four small studies about treating a problem called hydrocele. 275 people with this problem were in the studies. They were split into two groups: one group had a procedure called aspiration and sclerotherapy, and the other group had surgery. We found that both treatments worked about the same to make the problem go away. But, the group that had aspiration and sclerotherapy had the problem come back more often. The surgery group had more infections, but not enough to be a big problem. The people who had aspiration and sclerotherapy were able to go back to work faster and had fewer problems after the procedure. We
We looked at a study that tested a medicine called nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) on 40 kids with a breathing problem and a cold. We found that the medicine did not make a big difference in how much they coughed after two weeks. But, the kids who didn't take the medicine had less coughing at night. We also found that other things like trouble breathing and lung tests were better for the kids who didn't take the medicine, but we need more studies to be sure. Right now, we don't have enough proof to say if any treatments work for this
We looked at 21 studies with 2658 people who were randomly chosen to get some kind of talk therapy. None of the studies looked at physical therapy. Most of the studies looked at a type of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but some looked at other kinds of talk therapy. The people in the studies had been feeling bad for a long time. Most of the studies were not done in a way that was completely fair, so we can't be sure if the results are accurate. Some people dropped out of the studies. The studies showed that talk therapy can help people feel better, but the effect is not very
We looked at a bunch of studies to see if using certain types of pain relief during surgery can help prevent pain that lasts a long time after the surgery. We found that using certain types of pain relief during surgery might help prevent pain that lasts a long time after surgery for some types of surgeries, like breast cancer surgery and caesarean section. But we need more studies to be sure. We can't say for sure if it works for other types of surgeries or other types of pain relief.
Scientists did some tests on different medicines to see if they could help people with a mental health condition called Borderline Personality Disorder. They tested medicines called first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, antidepressants, and a dietary supplement called omega-3 fatty acid. They found that the second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acid might be helpful, but they need to do more tests to be sure. They also found that some medicines had side effects, like weight gain and feeling sleepy. They did some tests to compare different medicines, but they didn't find
We looked at seven different studies that had a total of 349 people in them. 217 people finished the studies. Some of the studies had people switch between different treatments, and some had people stay in the same treatment group the whole time. Two new studies were added to this review. Some of the studies didn't give us very good information because they didn't look at individual people's differences. Some of the studies didn't have very many people in them, or didn't look at all the things we were interested in. We looked at six different things we wanted to learn about, but some of the studies didn't tell us everything
We looked at 30 studies with almost 19,000 people who had cancer as kids. Some studies looked at how many kids felt really tired after their treatment. We found that some kids felt really tired and some didn't. We also found that some kids who had certain types of cancer felt more tired than others. We couldn't combine all the results because they were too different. We also found that some things, like feeling sad, might make kids feel more tired. But we need more research to know for sure. We found some problems with the studies we looked at, so we need more research to know how many kids feel really
We looked at 36 different tests that involved 6914 people. Some people got medicine to help prevent infections and some did not. We found that when people got both a cream and a pill medicine, they were less likely to get sick and less likely to die. When people only got the cream medicine, they were less likely to get sick but it did not help them live longer. We only found one test that looked at the bad effects of the medicine and it did not show any problems.
Some people did some studies to see if teaching nursing staff different ways to take care of older people would help them use less physical restraints (like straps or belts). They looked at five studies, but they weren't all done the same way and some were not very good. Four studies looked at people who live in nursing homes and one looked at people who live in a group home. Some studies had only one or two nursing homes in them. The studies didn't all agree on whether teaching nursing staff helped reduce the use of physical restraints. One study found that both groups used more physical restraints after eight months, while three other studies
This is a study about a medicine called glucocorticoid that some women take when they are trying to have a baby with IVF. The study looked at four different tests with 416 women. Two of the tests didn't give enough information, so they only used data from two tests with 310 women. They found that there wasn't enough evidence to say if the medicine helped women have a baby or not. They also didn't find any evidence that the medicine caused any bad side effects. They need to do more research to know for sure if the medicine helps women have a baby.
We looked at eight studies with 291 people between the ages of 5 and 23. In seven of the studies, we compared a medicine called rhGH to no medicine. In one study, we compared three different doses of rhGH. The studies lasted either six months or one year. We found that rhGH might help people with CF breathe better, but we're not sure if a higher dose is better than a lower dose. We also found that rhGH might help people with CF grow taller, gain weight, and have more muscle, but we're not sure if a higher dose is better than a lower dose. We found
We looked at 26 studies with 1,695 people who had asthma from their job. The studies compared three things: completely stopping exposure to the thing that caused their asthma, reducing exposure to it, or continuing to be exposed to it. Reducing exposure meant using less of the thing, improving ventilation, or wearing protective gear. In some cases, people changed to a different job with less exposure or learned about how to avoid it. The studies found that stopping exposure or reducing exposure to the thing that caused asthma can help improve symptoms. Stopping exposure may also help improve lung function. However, stopping exposure may also increase the risk
This is a report about six different tests that were done on people who had stomach problems. Most of the people were between 48 and 57 years old, but some were older. They all went to the doctor's office and had either mild or non-serious stomach problems. In five of the tests, the doctors told the patients to only take medicine when they had symptoms, and in one test, they told the patients to stop taking medicine suddenly. The doctors found that taking medicine all the time worked better than only taking it when you have symptoms. But, taking medicine only when you have symptoms can help you take fewer pills. Some
We looked at 13 studies with 975 people to see if social skills programs helped people with schizophrenia. We found that social skills programs were better than regular care or talking groups at helping people with their social skills. People who did social skills programs were less likely to go back to the hospital and had better mental health. They also had a better quality of life. However, when we compared social skills programs to talking groups, we didn't see a big difference. The studies were mostly done in China, so we don't know if the results will be the same in other places. We need more studies to find out if social skills programs
This is a study about a medicine called pegloticase that can help people with a condition called gout. Gout can cause painful bumps called tophi. The study found that pegloticase can help get rid of these bumps, but it can also cause some bad side effects like making people feel sick. The study was done on a small group of people, so more research is needed to be sure if this medicine is safe and helpful.
Scientists looked at five studies about using medicine called oral immunoglobulin to prevent a sickness called NEC in babies. They found three studies that were good enough to use. They looked at 2095 babies and found that giving the medicine did not make a big difference in how many babies got sick with NEC or needed surgery or died from NEC. So, the scientists say that there is not enough proof that this medicine helps prevent NEC. They also say that there are no studies about using a different medicine called oral IgA to prevent NEC.
This text is talking about a treatment called chemotherapy that can help people who have had surgery and radiation for a certain type of cancer. Some studies were done to see if adding chemotherapy after surgery and radiation would help people live longer and not have the cancer come back. The studies showed that adding chemotherapy did help people live longer and reduced the risk of the cancer coming back. Chemotherapy can also help prevent the cancer from spreading to other parts of the body.
We looked at 35 studies from different countries around the world. Some studies asked people how they felt about getting messages on their phones about their health. Some people liked getting the messages because it made them feel supported and connected. But some people had problems with getting the messages. Some people didn't have good phone service or couldn't afford to get the messages. Some people also had trouble reading or understanding the messages. People also wanted the messages to be sent at a time that was good for them and to be free. People also wanted the messages to be private and not shared with others. We found that it's important for people who make
We looked at 23 studies with 2467 people to see if methadone is better than other medicines for treating addiction. We found that there was no big difference between methadone and other medicines in terms of finishing treatment or staying away from drugs after treatment. Some people had discomfort from withdrawal symptoms and side effects, but we couldn't compare this for all the studies. When we compared methadone to other specific medicines, we found that they were all about the same. When we compared methadone to a fake medicine (placebo), the fake medicine made people feel worse and more people stopped treatment. The studies show that
This text talks about different ways to help people who are addicted to drugs stop using them. The researchers looked at nine studies with over a thousand people. They found that using a medicine called naltrexone can help people stop using drugs faster than other medicines. But, it can also make the withdrawal symptoms worse. The researchers also found that using heavy sedation (being put to sleep) to help with withdrawal can be dangerous and expensive. So, they don't recommend it.
We looked at fourteen studies about a medicine called molindone. Some studies were short and some were longer. We found that we can't say for sure if molindone works better than a fake medicine called placebo. When we compared molindone to other medicines for mental health, we didn't see a big difference in how well they worked. Molindone might make you lose weight, but it doesn't cause more problems with moving than other medicines. The studies we looked at were not very good, so we can't be sure if molindone is a good medicine or not.
We looked at 20 different studies with over 2000 people trying out 23 different ways to lighten dark spots on the skin. We couldn't combine all the information because everyone tried different things. Some of the treatments included creams with special ingredients like hydroquinone or vitamin C. We found that a cream with three ingredients worked better than just one or two ingredients. Another cream with a special acid worked better than a cream with a lower amount of hydroquinone. Some people also tried a cream called Thiospot, which worked better than not using anything. The side effects were usually mild like itching or burning. We need more studies
This is a report about 12 different tests that were done on 1319 people. The tests were not all done the same way and some were not very good. The people in the tests were mostly white and between 61 and 75 years old. The tests were all at least one year long. The tests showed that using a certain medicine called 5-FU after eye surgery can help reduce the chance of the surgery not working. This was especially true for people who were at high risk of the surgery not working. The medicine also helped lower the pressure in the eye. However, using the medicine can also cause other
Scientists looked at 55 studies with over 16,000 people who have a breathing problem called COPD. They found that using a medicine called ICS for a long time (more than six months) did not always help people breathe better. But it did help reduce how often they got sick and how much their breathing problems affected their daily life. However, using ICS can also cause some side effects like getting a mouth infection or pneumonia. Doctors and patients need to think about both the good and bad effects of using ICS before deciding if it's the right medicine for them.
We looked at 80 different studies that involved 5820 women. These studies compared 20 different types of medicine called NSAIDs. Some of these medicines were better than others for helping with period pain. We found that NSAIDs were better than a fake medicine called a placebo for helping with period pain. But, NSAIDs can also cause more side effects like stomach problems and headaches. When we compared different NSAIDs to each other, we didn't find much difference in how well they worked or how safe they were. We also looked at two special types of NSAIDs, but we didn't find enough information to say if they were better
We looked at seven studies with 2565 people to see if using high or low levels of PEEP (a type of air pressure) made a difference in how well people did. In five of the studies, the same amount of air was used in both groups, but in two of the studies, different amounts of air were used. We found that three of the studies were not very fair, but the others were good. We found that using high or low levels of PEEP did not make a big difference in how many people died or got hurt. Using high levels of PEEP did help people breathe better, but the studies were
This is a study about a type of liquid called HES that is used to help people who are sick. The study looked at 42 other studies with over 11,000 patients. They found that people who were given HES were more likely to have kidney problems and need extra help for their kidneys compared to people who were given other liquids. The study also found that HES might help with some kidney problems, but it's not clear how much is safe to use. The study suggests that doctors should use other liquids instead of HES for most patients.
We looked at nine studies with 682 people. Some studies didn't tell us everything they did. Seven studies showed that Rheum officinale helped with kidney problems, compared to doing nothing. Two studies compared Rheum officinale to a medicine called captopril, but we didn't see a big difference. We don't know if Rheum officinale helps people live longer or how much it costs. Only a few people had small problems with Rheum officinale. We don't have a lot of good evidence that Rheum officinale helps people with kidney problems, so we can't say for sure if it
This text talks about a test called IQCODE that helps doctors figure out if someone has dementia. The test is pretty good at finding people who have dementia, but it's not as good at figuring out who doesn't have it. The test works better in a regular hospital than in a special memory hospital. The test is the same whether it has 16 or 26 questions, and it doesn't matter what language it's in. But, the test results might not be accurate because the studies that were done were different from each other and might not be fair. So, doctors can use this test to help figure out if someone has dementia
We looked at three studies with 91 people who had a stroke. All three studies were not very good and might not be completely true. The studies were about different ways to help people move their arms better after a stroke. They tried things like special exercises and using a machine to help move their arm. One of the ways, called mCIMT, seemed to help people move their arm better for up to six months. Another way, using a special brace, might help people move their arm less after 14 weeks. But we don't know for sure if these things work well because the studies were not very good. We also
This is a study about how to help people who have a sickness called HBV after they get a new liver. The study looked at four different ways to treat the sickness. Some people got one medicine, some got two medicines, and some got different medicines. The study did not find that any of the treatments worked better than the others. The study was not big enough to be sure. The doctors need to do more studies with more people to find out the best way to help people with HBV after they get a new liver.
Scientists looked at many studies about different ways to treat a type of diabetes called LADA. They found 15 studies with 1019 people who were followed for 3 months to 10 years. All of the studies had some problems. They found that a medicine called sulphonylurea (SU) did not work better than insulin alone to control blood sugar levels. In fact, SU made blood sugar levels worse compared to insulin alone. SU also made people need insulin sooner. Some other treatments, like Chinese remedies and vitamin D with insulin, did not show much difference compared to insulin alone. One treatment called GAD65 might help
We looked at 70 studies with almost 45,000 people to see if talking about alcohol in a certain way helps college students drink less. We found that the studies were only okay quality. We were most interested in seeing if the effects lasted for at least four months. We found that talking about alcohol in a certain way did not make a big difference in how much college students drank. Some studies showed a small difference, but it was not enough to make a big change. We think more research needs to be done to see if talking about alcohol in a certain way can really help college students drink less.
We looked at three different tests with 492 people who had hip surgery. One test had 81 people who were told to be careful with their hips and use special equipment, while the other group didn't get any special instructions. We don't know if being careful and using equipment helped them feel better or have a better quality of life. Nobody's hip came out of place and nobody got hurt in either group. Another test had 265 people who were either told to be careful and use equipment or not. We don't know if people who used equipment were happier with their recovery or if their hip came out of place more often. The
This is a study about a type of birth control called LNG-IUD. The study looked at how well it worked for women with a condition called endometriosis, which can cause painful periods. The study found that in two of the trials, the women who used LNG-IUD had fewer painful periods than the women who didn't use it. The women who used LNG-IUD also said they were happier with their treatment. However, more studies are needed to be sure that LNG-IUD is the best treatment for endometriosis.
We looked at 24 studies about food. Most of them (20 out of 24) were worried about mistakes in the study. All of the studies were about food, not alcohol or tobacco. Most of the studies were done in labs with grown-ups and they used different designs. They were all done in rich countries, mostly in the USA. Some studies changed how many food options were available or where the food was placed. When there were fewer options or the food was farther away, people chose and ate less of it. But we need more research to be sure. We should study more types of food and do the research for longer
This text talks about how to prevent getting HIV after being exposed to it. They did a study and found that the risk of getting HIV was higher if there was a deep injury, visible blood on the device, a needle was used in the source patient's blood vessel, or if the source patient was very sick. They also found that taking a medicine called zidovudine after being exposed to HIV can help lower the risk of getting HIV. However, taking three medicines at once can cause more side effects. It's important for healthcare workers to know that taking medicine after being exposed to HIV is not a guarantee that they won't get
This text talks about two types of therapy for people with chronic pain. One is called behavior therapy and the other is called CBT. The text says that there isn't a lot of evidence that behavior therapy works, but CBT can help people feel better and do things they couldn't do before. However, the effects of CBT don't always last very long. The text also says that we need to do more research to figure out which parts of CBT work best for different people and why.
We looked at a lot of papers (881!) about programs that help people eat less salt. We found 15 programs that met our standards, but none of them were in poor countries. Most of the programs didn't have a control group, which means we couldn't compare them to people who didn't participate. We focused on 10 programs that had enough information to study. We found that some programs helped people eat less salt, but others didn't make a difference or even made people eat more salt. Some programs were better for women, and some were better for men. We didn't find any bad effects from these programs. We
We looked at 18 studies about medicine for teeth grinding while sleeping, but only 7 were good enough to use. All of the studies had only a few people in them, and they tested different medicines compared to a fake medicine. Some of the studies showed that the medicine might help, but others were not sure. One study showed that a medicine called clonidine might change the way you sleep. Some people had side effects from the medicine, like feeling tired or having a dry mouth. We need more studies with more people to know for sure if these medicines can help with teeth grinding while sleeping.
We looked at 10 studies with over 1000 people to see if taking special food or supplements with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants would help people with a lung problem called ARDS. Some of the studies were not done very well. The studies were different in many ways, like how long they lasted and what they measured. All the studies looked at whether people died or not. We found that the special food and supplements did not make a big difference in whether people died or not. We are not sure if the special food and supplements help people breathe better or stay in the hospital for less time. We are also not sure if
This text talks about how researchers ask people about any problems they had while taking medicine. They found that when they asked specific questions, they found more problems than when they asked general questions. Some problems were only found when they asked specific questions, but some were only found when they asked general questions. Sometimes, they had to talk to people in an interview to find the most serious problems. They also found that some ways of asking questions were better than others at finding problems. This is important because if they don't find all the problems, they might not know if the medicine is safe. In the future, researchers should use clear words and ask
We looked at a lot of information about how to prevent a problem called SUDEP in people with epilepsy. We found 582 records in databases and other places. We took out 211 records that were the same as others and looked at 381 more closely. We decided that 364 of them didn't have the information we needed. We looked at 17 articles in full and found that 15 of them didn't have the information we needed either. We found one study that said having someone watch over you while you sleep or using special devices might help prevent SUDEP. But we need more research to know for sure if other
This text talks about a review of studies that looked at a way to help people with cystic fibrosis clear their airways. The review found that a technique called autogenic drainage was not better than other ways of clearing the airways. The studies had different designs and lengths, and some had few participants. The review suggests that more research is needed to see if autogenic drainage is really helpful for people with cystic fibrosis.
This is a study about different ways to help people who feel very anxious. The study looked at 25 different groups of people (1305 people in total). Out of those groups, 22 of them (1060 people) were used to compare two types of therapy. One type is called CBT and the other is called TAU/WL. The study found that CBT therapy was better at helping people feel better after treatment and also helped reduce anxiety, worry, and depression. The study did not look at the long-term effects of CBT compared to TAU/WL. The study also compared CBT to another type of
This is a study about how giving women a hormone called progestogen might help them have fewer miscarriages. The study looked at 12 different trials with almost 2,000 women from different countries. Some of the women had had multiple miscarriages before. The study found that giving progestogen might help women have more live births, but it's not clear if it helps prevent preterm birth or other problems. Overall, the study suggests that progestogen might be helpful for women who have had multiple miscarriages.
We looked at 14 studies with 1298 people. Some studies compared two types of help for pregnant women who use drugs, and some studies didn't. We checked if the studies were fair and if they measured important things like how healthy the moms and babies were. We found that the help didn't make a big difference in keeping moms from using drugs or in how healthy the babies were. But, we did find that babies stayed in the hospital for less time when their moms got one type of help. We need more studies to know for sure if this kind of help is good for pregnant women who use drugs.
We looked at 31 studies with over 27,000 people to see which way of doing heart tests and treatments was better. We found that using the wrist instead of the leg was better for some things, like having less bad things happen during the hospital stay and less people dying. But it was harder to do the procedure and there wasn't enough information about what happens after 30 days.
We looked at two studies about how to help people with advanced dementia feel better. The studies were different from each other, so we couldn't combine their information. They measured 31 different things, but not the same things. We hope to include six more studies in the future. Both studies had some problems, so we don't know for sure if the things they tried helped. One study looked at how a team of people could help when someone with advanced dementia was in the hospital. They made a plan for how to take care of the person, but only two people actually used the plan. The other study looked at how to help family
This is a report about three different tests that were done on 1,166 women with breast cancer. They were testing different ways of giving medicine to help prevent the cancer from coming back. The tests showed that it didn't really matter which way the medicine was given, as long as radiation treatment started within seven months after surgery. One way of giving the medicine did cause some side effects like anemia, telangiectasia, and pigmentation, but it didn't make the women look worse. In one of the tests, giving radiation treatment before the medicine increased the risk of getting sick, but it didn't cause any other problems.
We looked at nine studies with 622 people to see if a supplement called CrP helps with weight loss. The studies were done in the community and lasted up to 24 weeks. Some people did exercises with CrP and some with a fake pill. We wanted to know which amount of CrP worked best. We found that all amounts of CrP helped people lose a little bit of weight after 12 to 16 weeks. But we're not sure if it's enough to really make a difference. We also looked at if CrP had any bad side effects. Some people had serious problems when they took a lot of CrP
This is a report about different ways to help wounds heal. The report looked at 11 studies with 886 people. Some studies were too small or didn't give clear information. Two studies looked at using iodine to help wounds heal, but it wasn't clear if it worked. One study found that a special cream called sucralfate helped wounds heal faster and hurt less. Another study found that using a special soap called Triclosan helped wounds heal faster. One study found that using honey-soaked gauze helped wounds heal better than using a different kind of gauze. Another study found that using a special cream
We looked at five different studies that involved 1049 women who were having a test called amniocentesis or CVS. The studies tested different ways of doing the tests, like using a different medicine or choosing a different spot to put the needle. However, none of the ways showed to be better than the usual way of doing the test. The studies were not good enough to change how doctors usually do the tests. Doctors should keep using the way they are used to doing the tests until there is better evidence that a new way is better. If there are more studies done in the future that are safe and show a clear difference,
We looked at 10 studies about adding vitamins to flour. Some studies used wheat flour and some used maize flour. Most studies were done in countries that are not very rich. The studies lasted from two weeks to three years. We found that adding folic acid to flour may help prevent birth defects, but we need more studies to be sure. Adding folic acid to flour may also help increase the amount of folate in a person's blood. We don't know if adding folic acid to flour helps with anemia. We also don't know if there are any bad effects from adding folic acid to flour. There were not
Scientists looked at six studies about a disease called CF in babies. They found two studies that were good enough to use. They looked at how babies who were screened for CF did compared to babies who were not screened. They found that babies who were screened were less likely to have bad nutrition. They were also more likely to have good lung function when they were seven years old. When they were diagnosed, their chest X-rays looked better than the babies who were not screened. But as they got older, their chest X-rays got worse. This was because of other things that affected their health, like the kind of CF they had and if they
We looked at five studies with over 7,000 people who had high blood pressure and diabetes. One study compared having a lower blood pressure goal (less than 120) to a standard goal (less than 140). The group with the lower goal had a lower risk of stroke, but also had more side effects. Four studies looked at having a lower goal for the bottom number in blood pressure (less than 80) compared to a standard goal (less than 90). The group with the lower goal had a lower blood pressure, but there was no clear difference in the risk of heart attack or heart failure. We need more
This is a study about how to help people with diabetes who have sores on the bottom of their feet. The study looked at different ways to treat the sores. They found that using a special cast that can't be taken off and helps relieve pressure on the sore is better than using a cast that can be taken off or just using a dressing. They also found that using the special cast with a surgery to lengthen the Achilles tendon helped even more. Other treatments they looked at didn't work as well.
This is a study about different ways to help people who had breast cancer and are having trouble with their thinking. They looked at five different studies with a total of 235 people. Some people did computer games to help their thinking, some learned new ways to remember things, some did meditation, and some did physical activity. The studies showed that the computer games and new ways to remember things helped people's thinking and made them feel better. The meditation and physical activity didn't show clear results. The studies were not perfect, so we need more research to be sure. We also need to study other types of cancer patients.
We looked at some papers about two different medicines called chlorpromazine and piperacetazine. We found 12 papers, but only used 5 because the others were not good enough. The papers were from the 1970s and had information about 343 people. The papers were not very good and only had short-term information. We found that both medicines were about the same in helping people with schizophrenia. Both medicines had some side effects, but they were about the same. We need more research to be sure which medicine is better. So, doctors and people with schizophrenia should know that we don't have enough good information to choose
Doctors did a study with 207 people who had a blockage in their colon. Half of them got a special tube put in called a stent, and the other half had surgery right away. The surgery group had better results, but both groups had about the same number of people who died or had problems. The stent group had some problems with the tube moving or getting blocked, but they stayed in the hospital for less time and had less blood loss. The doctors need to do more studies to be sure which treatment is best.
We looked at nine studies that tested different medicines to see if they could help prevent a problem called OHSS in women. OHSS can happen when women take medicine to help them get pregnant. The studies tested three different medicines: human albumin, HES, and mannitol. The studies compared these medicines to either a fake medicine or no medicine at all. The studies were not perfect, but they showed that these medicines can help prevent OHSS in women who are at high risk for it. However, the studies also showed that human albumin can lower the chance of getting pregnant. The studies did not report how many women had babies.
Doctors did ten studies on 484 patients to see which medicine works best for treating spider veins on the legs. They found that all the medicines worked better than a fake medicine, but none of them worked better than the others. Some of the medicines caused more side effects than others, and some were more painful than others. The doctors need to do more research to find out which medicine is the best and how much to use. They also need to study more about the patients who get spider veins.
We looked at seven studies with 241 people to see how to treat high levels of potassium in the blood. We couldn't combine the results because the treatments were different in each study. Most studies didn't explain how they chose who got the treatment or if they knew who got it. None of the studies looked at if the treatments helped people live longer or avoid heart problems. But we found that some treatments can lower potassium levels. One treatment called salbutamol, which can be given through a machine or a spray, worked well. It lowered potassium levels the most after about an hour or two. Other treatments like insulin and bicarbonate
This is a report about studies that looked at different ways to keep tubes in people's bodies clean. The tubes are called CVCs and they are used for a treatment called HD. Some tubes had a special solution put in them to keep them clean, while others had a different solution. The studies found that the special solution probably helped to reduce infections in the tubes, but it didn't make much of a difference in preventing blood clots. The studies also found that the special solution with antibiotics helped to reduce infections more than the solution without antibiotics. The studies were not perfect, so more research is needed to be sure that the special solution
We looked at 15 studies with 1098 people to see if pre-emptive treatment (medicine to prevent a disease) works better than other treatments for a virus called CMV. Some studies compared pre-emptive treatment to a fake medicine or no treatment, while others compared it to a different kind of medicine. We found that pre-emptive treatment can help prevent CMV disease, but it doesn't seem to help with other problems like rejection or death. When we compared pre-emptive treatment to the other medicine, we didn't see a big difference in preventing CMV disease, but pre-emptive treatment had
We looked at three studies that tested sweet potato on people with type 2 diabetes. The studies had 140 people and lasted from six weeks to five months. The studies were done by the same person, but we're not sure if they were fair. The studies compared sweet potato to a fake pill and found that sweet potato helped lower a number called HbA1c. This number shows how well someone's diabetes is controlled. There were no bad side effects reported. But we don't know if sweet potato helps with other problems related to diabetes or if it's safe to use. We need more studies to find out.
We looked at 62 studies about a breathing technique for people with cystic fibrosis. 19 of those studies, with 440 people, were good enough to use. We looked at 5 studies with 192 people that compared the breathing technique to other ways of helping people with cystic fibrosis breathe better. Some studies lasted only one day, but two studies lasted one to three years. Most studies didn't tell us enough about how they did the study, so we don't know if they were done well. People in the studies tried different ways of helping them breathe better, and some people liked one way better than another.
This is a study about how to help women who are having trouble getting pregnant. They looked at 8 different studies with 733 women. They found that when they used a new way of putting the sperm and egg together, called brief co-incubation, it helped more women get pregnant and have a baby. They still need to do more studies to see if it helps even more.
This text talks about how using a certain type of breathing machine called a ventilator can affect babies who have trouble breathing. The study found that using a long time for each breath can cause more air to leak out of the baby's lungs, and can sometimes even cause the baby to die. It's important to be careful when using this type of machine and to use a shorter time for each breath if the baby's lungs are not working well. However, this study was done a long time ago and things have changed since then, so we need to be careful when applying these results to babies today.
We looked at 33 studies with over 5000 patients to see if TFU (which is when doctors check on patients after they leave the hospital) is helpful. The studies were not all done the same way, so it was hard to compare them. Some studies showed that TFU helped patients, but others did not. We can't say for sure if TFU is helpful because the studies were not very good. No bad effects were found though.
We looked at 38 studies that tried to keep people in a research study. They tried different ways to keep people interested, like giving them money or making the questions shorter. Most of the studies asked people to answer questions by mail or online. Some studies looked at ways to get people to come back to the study site. Giving people money or offering more money helped get more people to answer the questions. Some other ways looked good but need more testing. The best way to keep people in a study depends on the study and the people in it.
We looked at eight studies with 829 people to compare two types of breathing devices. One type is called pLMA and the other is called cLMA. We found that both devices worked well and there were no big differences between them. The pLMA took a little longer to put in, but it made a better seal for breathing. The cLMA had lower air pressure during breathing. We also found that there were not many problems with either device. However, we need more information to be sure about some of the differences. Overall, both devices are good for helping people breathe.
We looked at 19 studies with 1453 kids from eight different countries who had stomach pain. Some kids got probiotics, some got fiber, and some got special diets. We found that probiotics helped reduce pain more than a fake pill. But we're not sure if the results are completely accurate. We need more studies to be sure. Fiber and special diets didn't seem to help much. We didn't find any bad side effects from any of the treatments. Doctors might want to try probiotics to help kids with stomach pain, but we need more research to be sure.
We looked at 22 studies with 4490 people. Most of the studies were done with students. We found that mass media interventions might help reduce prejudice, but we don't know if they help with discrimination. The studies were not all the same, so it's hard to say for sure. We also don't know much about the costs or any bad effects. We need more research to know for sure if mass media interventions can help with prejudice and discrimination.
We looked at 85 studies from 41 different countries about how pregnant women and their healthcare providers feel about getting care before and after having a baby. Some studies were about just the women's feelings, some were about just the healthcare providers' feelings, and some were about both. We found 52 important things from these studies and put them into three groups: the culture around pregnancy, how healthcare is set up, and what matters to women and healthcare providers. We also found that women are more likely to keep getting care if they have a good experience the first time they go. Healthcare providers need enough time, resources, and training to give
Doctors did a study with 3361 patients to see if certain medicines could help people who had a problem with their brain called aneurysmal SAH. They found that one type of medicine called calcium antagonists helped reduce the risk of bad things happening to the patients. Another medicine called magnesium sulphate might also help, but they need to do more research to be sure. One medicine called nimodipine can help too, but they need to do more research to be sure about other calcium antagonists. Doctors think that nimodipine is a good choice for patients with aneurysmal SAH because it can help and
We looked at three studies with 739 kids to see which treatment worked best for high-risk neuroblastoma. They all used one year old as the age to decide who was high-risk. We found that myeloablative therapy worked better than regular chemotherapy or no treatment for keeping kids free from the disease. It also worked better for keeping them alive in two of the studies, but not in the third when we looked at more follow-up data. We didn't find any big differences in side effects between the treatments, but myeloablative therapy might cause more problems with the kidneys, lungs, and blood vessels. We don't know
We looked at eight different studies with 632 people who had liver cancer. All of the studies had some problems, so we're not completely sure about the results. The people in the studies were between 16 and 78 years old, and most of them were men. They had different stages of liver cancer and were followed for about a year. The studies compared two treatments: TACE followed by 3-DCRT and TACE alone. TACE followed by 3-DCRT might be better than TACE alone because it could help people live longer and shrink their tumors more. But, TACE followed by 3
No studies were found that compared giving more food to babies with lung problems to giving them a normal amount of food. However, two studies showed that giving babies special formula with extra protein and minerals helped them grow better. Another study showed that giving babies different amounts of food didn't make a difference in their growth or breathing. We need more studies to see if giving more food to babies with lung problems is helpful or not. We also need to figure out the best way to give them more food, like using special milk or giving them food through a tube.
Thirteen studies were done with over 2,000 people to see if using ultrasound to help put a tube in a vein was better than just using a person's body as a guide. The studies showed that using ultrasound made it less likely to accidentally poke an artery or get a bruise when putting the tube in the neck vein. For the leg vein, using ultrasound made it more likely to get the tube in on the first try. However, there wasn't enough information to know if using ultrasound was better for people who are at high risk for problems or if it was better for people who are new at putting in tubes. Overall,
Scientists did some studies to see if a medicine called physostigmine could help people with Alzheimer's disease. They tried giving it to people in different ways, like through a skin patch or by swallowing a pill. They found that when people got the medicine through an IV, it didn't work. When people took the medicine by mouth, it didn't seem to help much and made some people feel sick. When they tried a special kind of pill that slowly releases the medicine, it seemed to help a little bit, but a lot of people still felt sick and had to stop taking it. When they tried a skin patch, some people
We looked at 13 studies with over 16,000 people who had heart problems. Some had a history of heart disease and some had a history of stroke. We found that taking fibrates helped prevent strokes, heart attacks, and death from heart problems. But it didn't help prevent all types of death or strokes specifically. When we took out one type of fibrate called clofibrate, it didn't help prevent the main problems anymore, but it still helped prevent heart attacks. Taking fibrates didn't cause any more problems than not taking them. We need more studies to see if fibrates work well with other treatments and for
This is a study about a medicine called TA that can help women who are having a baby. The study looked at 12 different tests with over 3,000 women who were having a baby. Some of the women had a medicine called TA, while others did not. The study found that women who had TA had less bleeding after having their baby. They also needed fewer medical treatments and blood transfusions. However, some women who had TA had mild side effects like feeling sick. The study did not find any serious side effects, but more research is needed to be sure. Overall, TA can help women who are having a baby,
We looked at 12 studies that tested two medicines, amantadine and rimantadine, to see if they could help treat the flu. We found that amantadine helped prevent the flu in kids, but we're not sure if it's safe. Rimantadine helped lower fever in kids, but it didn't prevent the flu in older people. We didn't find any bad side effects from either medicine. Overall, we don't think these medicines are very helpful for treating the flu in kids or older people.
Scientists did a study with 1512 women who had trouble getting pregnant. They tried a procedure called intentional endometrial injury to see if it would help them have a baby. Some women had the procedure before trying to get pregnant with help from a doctor, and some tried to get pregnant on their own. The scientists found that the procedure might help some women get pregnant, but they are not sure because the evidence is not very strong. The procedure might cause some pain, but only one study reported this. The scientists need to do more studies with more people to know for sure if the procedure helps women have babies.
We looked at four studies with 3,905 people. All of the studies were not very good. They compared getting your teeth cleaned by a professional to just regular teeth cleaning. One study with 834 people didn't show a clear difference between the two groups. We don't know if getting your teeth cleaned by a professional is better than regular cleaning for preventing pneumonia or the first time you get pneumonia. Two studies showed that getting your teeth cleaned by a professional might help prevent death from pneumonia. We don't know if getting your teeth cleaned by a professional is better than regular cleaning for preventing all kinds of death. Only one study looked at
Some people did some studies to see what works best to help people with a problem called lymphocytic colitis. They looked at different medicines and compared them to fake medicines called placebos. They found that one medicine called budesonide worked better than the fake medicine. Two other medicines called mesalazine and beclometasone dipropionate might also work, but they need more studies to be sure. Another medicine called bismuth subsalicylate didn't seem to work. Some people had side effects from the medicines like feeling sick or having a rash. The studies were not perfect, so we need more studies to
This is a study about people with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin. The study looked at 12 different tests with 3,259 people. Some tests lasted 6 months and some lasted 12 months. The tests compared people who checked their blood sugar levels with people who did not. The study found that checking blood sugar levels helped lower HbA1c levels for up to 6 months, but after 12 months, it did not make a big difference. Checking blood sugar levels did not seem to affect how happy or healthy people felt. One test found that checking blood sugar levels was more expensive than checking urine
This is a study about how to help people who have a problem called AsPD. They looked at 11 different ways to help, but only two of the studies were just about AsPD. They found that some ways of helping, like talking to someone about their problems, can be helpful for people who have problems with drugs or drinking. But they didn't find enough evidence to say that any of the ways they looked at are good for helping people with AsPD. They need to do more research to find better ways to help.
This is a report about 11 studies that looked at how well antibiotics work for colds and runny noses. Some studies had kids, some had adults, and some only had boys. They used different antibiotics and measured things in different ways. The studies showed that antibiotics did not help people get better from colds or runny noses any faster than taking nothing. In fact, antibiotics can cause bad side effects, especially in adults. So, doctors don't recommend using antibiotics for colds or runny noses.
We looked at five different tests with 162 people. Three of the tests were done in a hospital. One of the tests was paid for by a medicine company. The people in the tests were between 12 and 77 years old, but most were older. They had a skin problem called psoriasis. Some of them had a germ called streptococcus in their throat. We couldn't combine the results of the tests because they were too different. None of the tests looked at how long it took for the skin problem to go away or if it came back later. We don't know if the treatments worked well or if they
We looked at 12 studies with 933 people who have MS. Some people took vitamin D and some didn't. Most studies used vitamin D₃. We found that taking vitamin D didn't make a big difference in how often people had MS attacks, how disabled they were, or how many spots showed up on their MRI. We also found that taking vitamin D didn't make people have more bad side effects than those who didn't take it. Some studies showed that vitamin D might help with feeling tired and feeling better emotionally, but we need more studies to be sure. We don't know if vitamin D helps with other things like
We looked at some new studies, but we didn't use all of them. We looked at a total of 62 studies with 4241 people. We found that morphine can help with pain, but some people might not be able to take it because of side effects. Most people in the studies had no worse than mild pain. Morphine comes in different forms and strengths, and some people might need a higher dose than others. We need more studies to know for sure how well morphine works compared to other pain medicines.
This is a study about treating trigger finger, which is when your finger gets stuck in a bent position. The study looked at different treatments, like surgery and injections, and how well they worked. The study included 1260 people, mostly women, who were between 16 and 88 years old. The study found that surgery worked better than injections at preventing the finger from getting stuck again, but it was more painful. The study also found that there were some risks with surgery, like infections and injuries. The study didn't look at how well the treatments helped people use their hands or how satisfied they were with the treatment.
Scientists did some tests on different ways to treat a type of brain cancer called AO or AOA. They tested giving radiation therapy (RT) alone, or with a type of medicine called PCV chemotherapy, or just PCV chemotherapy, or just temozolomide chemotherapy. They found that using RT with PCV chemotherapy helped people live longer than just using RT alone. They also found that some special things in a person's genes can help doctors predict how well they will do with treatment. But, the PCV chemotherapy made some people very sick, so doctors are not sure if they should use a different medicine instead.
We did a study with 240 kids who had trouble breathing while they slept. Some got medicine to help them breathe better, and some got a fake medicine. We looked at how well the medicine worked and if there were any bad side effects. We found that one medicine called montelukast helped the kids breathe better and didn't have any bad side effects. Another medicine called intranasal corticosteroids might help a little bit, but we're not sure. We need more studies to see if these medicines are safe and if they really help kids do better in school.
Some doctors did some studies to see if giving medicine could help prevent blood clots in kids with tubes in their bodies. They looked at six different studies with over a thousand kids. They found that giving medicine did not really help prevent blood clots and did not cause any bad side effects. But, they say they need more studies to be sure.
This text talks about some medical studies that were done on people who had surgery for a certain kind of problem in their body. The studies looked at whether a special treatment called CSFD could help prevent problems with their nerves after the surgery. In one study, CSFD didn't seem to help much. But in another study, using CSFD with another treatment did help prevent problems. In a third study, using CSFD during and after surgery helped a lot - only a few people had problems with their nerves afterwards. When all the studies were looked at together, it seemed like using CSFD could help prevent nerve problems after this kind of surgery
We looked at 13 studies with 662 people to see which treatment works best for psoriasis. We wanted to know if people felt better, if their skin got better, if they had side effects, and if the treatment cleared their skin. One study showed that NB-UVB and oral PUVA were about the same for clearing skin. Three studies showed that oral PUVA was better than NB-UVB for clearing skin. Two studies showed that NB-UVB and bath PUVA were about the same for clearing skin, but one study showed that bath PUVA was better. One study showed that NB-UVB and topical
Scientists looked at 21 studies with 1525 people to see what helps with pooping and peeing in your pants. Some studies showed that doing exercises with a special machine called biofeedback can help more than just doing exercises alone. Another study showed that using a machine called electrical stimulation with biofeedback can help more than just using electrical stimulation alone. Another study showed that a special surgery called sacral nerve stimulation can help more than just doing exercises with biofeedback. But, there is not enough evidence to say for sure if exercises or biofeedback alone are helpful. Scientists need to do more studies to know for sure what helps the most.
Scientists looked at 39 different studies about using tubes to help people go to the bathroom after surgery. The studies were not very big and some were not very good. They found that using a tube in the bladder after surgery might help prevent the need for another tube later. They also found that taking the tube out sooner might help prevent infections. But, they only looked at a few studies for each thing, so they can't be completely sure. Doctors have to decide if the benefits of using a tube outweigh the risks of getting an infection or needing another tube later.
This text talks about a medicine called aripiprazole that can help people who have manic symptoms. Manic symptoms are when someone feels very excited or happy and has trouble sleeping or thinking clearly. The medicine was tested in ten studies with over 3,000 people. The studies showed that aripiprazole was better than a fake medicine in reducing manic symptoms after three or four weeks, but not after six weeks. The medicine was also compared to other medicines, but there was no big difference in how well they worked. However, aripiprazole caused more side effects like movement problems and stomach issues. The studies didn
Some doctors did some studies to see if using a special medicine called urokinase or ethanol with regular medicine would help kids with cancer who have tubes in their bodies. They looked at how many kids got better, how many got sick again, and how long it took for their blood to be free of germs. They found that using the special medicine did not make a big difference compared to just using regular medicine. Some of the studies were not done very well, so they need to do more studies to be sure.
Out of 15 tests, only 3 were really good. They found that giving advice about how to move and be active can help with neck pain in the short term, but not in the long term. Giving out pamphlets about this didn't really help. Other ways of teaching about neck pain didn't seem to make a difference. Doing specific exercises helped with chronic neck pain in the short term. Trying to take care of your neck on your own didn't seem to help. Overall, they didn't find many good ways to teach people about neck pain, but they think more research should be done to find better ways.
We looked at a lot of information about how to talk to people who might be at risk for a disease called CJD or vCJD. We found 49 studies that talked about how to communicate with these people. We learned that it's important to have a plan for how to talk to them and to make sure they get the help they need. If we don't communicate well, it could cause problems like not being able to get medical care. We still need more information to know the best way to talk to these people, but we can use what we learned to make better plans for the future.
We looked at one study that tested a medicine called opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus a fake medicine called placebo. The study had 304 people who were randomly chosen to take either the medicine or the fake medicine. After 12 weeks, the people who took the medicine had less Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) symptoms than the people who took the fake medicine. The people who took the medicine also had better quality of life and sleep. However, more people who took the medicine had side effects like stomach problems, feeling tired, and headaches. We need more studies to make sure the medicine
This text talks about a study that looked at two ways to treat a broken wrist. One way is to put a cast on it and the other way is to use something called external fixation. External fixation is when metal pins are put into the wrist to hold the bones in place. The study found that external fixation was better at keeping the bones in place and preventing the wrist from getting worse. However, it also had more problems like infections. The study didn't find a big difference in how well people could use their wrist after treatment. Overall, external fixation can be a good option for some people with a broken wrist, but it has some
We looked at five studies with 1,127 patients to see if taking out a tube in the body called a stent early or late was better. We found that we are not sure if taking it out early or late makes a difference in a problem called MUC. But, taking it out early may help reduce another problem called UTI, especially if a certain type of stent is used. We don't know how much it costs or how it affects people's lives. Taking out the stent early after a kidney transplant may help with UTI, but we need more information about MUC and other things.
We looked at five studies that compared different ways to fix teeth. Four of the studies compared putting a crown on a tooth with filling it. Two of those studies used a special way to put on the crown called the Hall Technique. The other two studies used the regular way. One study also looked at a third way to treat a tooth with a problem. The last study compared two different types of crowns. We looked at how well these treatments worked right after they were done and also in the short term (less than a year) and long term (more than a year). We found that putting a crown on a tooth is better than
This is a review of 28 studies that looked at different ways to help people with a lung disease called CF breathe better. Some studies used a mask, some used a mouthpiece, and some used other devices. The studies found that using PEP with a mask helped reduce lung problems more than other methods. People also preferred using PEP. Some studies had problems and didn't give enough information. It's important to choose the best way to help each person based on their needs and how their lungs are doing.
This is a study about a medicine called CZP that helps people with a sickness called Crohn's disease. The study looked at four other studies with 1485 people who had moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Most of the people were adults over 18 years old. The study found that CZP was better than a fake medicine at making people feel better. More people who took CZP got better than those who took the fake medicine. However, some people had bad side effects from CZP, like getting sicker or getting infections. The study says that CZP can help people with Crohn's disease, but more studies
We looked at 112 studies about people with kidney problems and heart failure. Some studies were only about adults with kidney problems, some were about the general population but had information about people with kidney problems, and some included people with kidney problems but didn't have specific information about them. We found that many of the studies had problems with how they were done. Out of the 112 studies, we found 31 that had information about people with kidney problems and heart failure. These studies followed people for different amounts of time and had different numbers of people in them. We looked at 26 of these studies that had information we could use.
This is a report about three studies that looked at how to monitor babies during labor. They found that both internal and external monitoring were safe and didn't cause any serious problems for the moms or babies. They also found that there was no difference in outcomes between the two types of monitoring. However, because there were only three studies with a total of 1945 women, they can't say for sure which type of monitoring is better.
We looked at two groups of people with a problem called CVI. We found that some of the things we wanted to know were not reported in both groups. We measured how bad the symptoms were in both groups, but we used different ways to do it, so we couldn't compare the results. One group did exercises and the other group did not. One study showed that the exercise group had less symptoms, but the other study showed no difference. We found that some things like leg ulcers and surgery were not looked at in either group. We also found that the studies we looked at were not very good, so we need more research
Doctors did a study on a treatment for knee pain called viscosupplementation. They looked at 76 different tests and found that the treatment worked better than a fake treatment called a placebo. The treatment helped with pain and how well people could move their knee. The best time for the treatment to work was 5 to 13 weeks after getting it. The treatment was also safer than other treatments that go all over the body. Different types of the treatment worked better for different people, so doctors need to be careful when choosing which one to use. Overall, the study showed that viscosupplementation is a good treatment for knee pain.
This is a study about how to help women who have heavy bleeding after giving birth. The study looked at different treatments and compared them to see which ones worked best. They found that using a medicine called misoprostol with other medicines did not help much. Using misoprostol by itself caused more side effects like vomiting and shivering. They also looked at other treatments, but they were too small to know if they worked well. The best treatment was using a medicine called oxytocin. They need to do more studies to find the best way to help women who don't get better with the first treatment.
Scientists did some experiments to see if giving babies a certain type of nutrient called cysteine would help them grow better. They did six experiments and most of the babies were born early. In five of the experiments, they gave the babies cysteine and in one experiment they gave them a different type of cysteine called N-acetylcysteine. They found that giving the babies cysteine helped them keep more nitrogen in their bodies, which is good for growing. But it didn't really affect their growth or other health problems. Giving the babies N-acetylcysteine didn't really help them either. The
We looked at 77 studies with 6287 people to see if medicine can help people with a liver problem called NAFLD. Only one study was really good, and the others might not be very accurate. Some studies only looked at people with a certain type of NAFLD or with diabetes. The studies lasted from one month to two years. We only looked at studies that compared medicine to no medicine and looked at things like if people died or had bad side effects. We found that we don't really know if medicine helps because the studies were not very good. Some studies were paid for by companies that make medicine, which might
Scientists studied 15 groups of people with memory problems and found 1,282 people who might have a disease called Alzheimer's. They followed up with these people for up to four years and found that 430 people got Alzheimer's and 130 people got other types of memory problems. The scientists tested a fluid in the brain of some of these people to see if it could help diagnose Alzheimer's. They found that the test was not always accurate, and more research is needed to make sure it works well. The scientists also found that it's important to be careful when diagnosing memory problems because some people might be diagnosed with Alzheimer's when
We looked at three studies with 170 men who were having surgery to remove their prostate. They were given different types of medicine to make them sleep during the surgery. We found that one type of medicine did not cause more pain after the surgery than the other type. We also found that one type of medicine might help prevent feeling sick after the surgery and might help prevent eye problems during the surgery. However, we are not sure if these results are important in real life. We did not find any information about other problems that might happen after the surgery. We need more studies with both men and women to know which medicine is best for this type
We looked at 14 studies with over 1.6 million people to see if using a certain medicine during pregnancy would cause any problems. Most of the studies showed that using the medicine did not cause any problems with having a baby. We looked at things like how the baby was born, birth defects, and how healthy the baby was. We also looked at how strong the medicine was and found that using a strong medicine might make the baby weigh less. Using a weaker medicine might actually help the baby stay healthy. We need to do more research to be sure. Overall, using this medicine during pregnancy is probably okay, but we need to
We looked at four studies about treating an eye infection called bacterial keratitis. A total of 611 people were in the studies, and they were from different countries. The studies compared using a medicine called corticosteroid to not using it. They followed up with the people for different amounts of time, from a few weeks to a year. None of the studies found a big difference between the group that used the medicine and the group that didn't. One study found that the group using the medicine took longer to heal, but the biggest study didn't find that. None of the studies found any big problems with using the medicine. However
We did a study with 450 people and found that a treatment called percutaneous vascular intervention did not work better than another treatment called intravenous thrombolytic therapy for stroke. We looked at how well people could function after the treatment and how many people died. We found that there was no big difference between the two treatments. We need more studies to be sure.
We looked at one study that involved 120 families and 143 kids. The study found that sending kids to a daycare center did not make them smarter or better at socializing compared to kids who stayed at home. The study also found that sending kids to daycare did not affect whether their moms worked or how much money their family made. However, the study did not look at what happens to kids in the long run, like when they finish high school or get a job. We need more studies to figure out if daycare is good for kids and families.
Scientists looked at 30 different ways to score how well someone's body was healing from a disease called UC. They found 11 ways that were tested by different people to make sure they were accurate. They also looked at how well the different ways of scoring matched up with what they were supposed to measure. Two of the ways of scoring were tested to see if they were good at measuring what they were supposed to. They found that some of the ways of scoring were better than others, but none of them were perfect. They need to do more research to find the best way to measure how well someone is healing from UC.
We looked at three studies that compared two ways of fixing broken bones in the lower leg. There were 213 people in the studies, but we only used data from 173 people. Most of the people were men and in their 40s. We don't know if surgery is better than not having surgery because there were no studies on that. The three studies we looked at were not very good because they had some problems. We are not very sure about the results because the quality of the evidence was very low. The results showed that one way of fixing the bones was a little better than the other way, but it was not a
We looked at 11 studies with over 38,000 people. Some studies compared a type of medicine called BPLDs to a fake medicine or no medicine, and others looked at different blood pressure targets. Some studies were better than others. We found that BPLDs can help reduce the risk of having another stroke. This was especially true for people who took a certain type of medicine. We're not sure yet what the best blood pressure target is for people who have had a stroke.
In this study, 519 men were tested in four different trials that lasted from 4 to 26 weeks. They were given a type of medicine called B-sitosterols to see if it helped with their urinary problems. The medicine did help improve their symptoms and urine flow, but it did not make their prostate smaller. The men who took the medicine did not have more side effects than the men who took a fake medicine. We still need to learn more about how safe and effective this medicine is in the long term.
This is a report about a medicine called salmeterol that is used to help people with asthma breathe better. The report looked at 26 different tests that compared salmeterol to a fake medicine called a placebo, and 8 tests that compared it to another medicine called salbutamol. In total, over 62,000 people with asthma (including 2,599 kids) were studied. The report found that there were some bad things that happened when people took salmeterol. More people died when they took salmeterol regularly compared to the fake medicine, but the difference wasn't big enough to be sure it wasn
Two studies looked at how to help babies who were born too early and had trouble breathing. One study gave some babies a medicine called L-thyroxine and the other study gave some babies a medicine called L-triiodothyronine. Both studies had some problems with how they were done, like not keeping the treatment a secret from the people doing the study. Neither study found that the medicine helped the babies get better. When they looked at both studies together, they found that the medicine did not make a big difference in whether the babies lived or died. The medicine also did not make a big difference in other things like how long
We looked at 38 studies with 1828 people. Some of the studies were better than others. We found that a type of sugar called non-absorbable disaccharides can help people with liver problems. It can help them live longer and have fewer bad things happen to them. It can also help with a problem called hepatic encephalopathy. This problem can make people feel sick and have trouble thinking. The sugar might also make people feel better overall, but we need more information to be sure. The sugar might cause some stomach problems, but they are not serious. Another type of sugar called lactulose is
This is a study about how to help people who have had a kidney transplant. They looked at different treatments like medicine and surgery to see if they helped with bone problems. They found that one medicine called bisphosphonate might help prevent broken bones, but they are not sure. They also found that this medicine might help with pain, but it might also cause low calcium levels. They are not sure if any other treatments help. They did not study if these treatments helped with other problems like heart attacks or death. They also did not study if these treatments helped kids who had a kidney transplant.
We looked at four different tests that involved 317 people. Three of the tests used magnesium that people took by mouth, and one test used magnesium that was given through a needle. Each test had some problems, and they were all different from each other. We didn't find any tests that looked at everything we wanted to know. Only one test looked at how people felt during alcohol withdrawal, and three tests looked at how strong people's hands were. We combined the results of those three tests, and we didn't see any big changes in hand strength. We didn't see any bad side effects from taking magnesium, but we also can't
We looked at 15 studies with over 3000 people to see if antibiotics help with a sickness called rhinosinusitis. This sickness makes your nose and sinuses hurt and can make you feel sick. We found that antibiotics can help you get better faster, but only a little bit. For every 100 people who take antibiotics, only 5 to 11 more people will get better faster than if they didn't take anything. Antibiotics can also cause side effects, like feeling sick to your stomach. We think that for most people with this sickness, antibiotics are not needed because the risks are not worth the small benefit. We
Doctors did some studies to see which way of taking out lymph nodes works best for people with stomach cancer. They looked at eight studies with over 2500 patients. Three studies were done in Asian countries and compared one way of taking out lymph nodes (called D3) to another way (called D2). They found that both ways were about the same for how long people lived and how many people died after surgery. Only one study looked at how long people went without the cancer coming back (called DFS). Five studies compared D2 to another way of taking out lymph nodes (called D1). They found that both ways were about the
This is a report about a medicine called naltrexone that is used to help people who are addicted to drugs. The report looked at 13 studies with 1158 people. The report found that naltrexone did not work better than a fake medicine or no medicine at all for most things. The only thing it seemed to help with was keeping people out of jail, but this was only shown in two studies. When people were forced to take the medicine, it helped them stay in treatment and stop using drugs. But when naltrexone was compared to other medicines, it did not work any better. The report says
We looked at some studies about changing food and drinks to make them easier to swallow for people with dementia and Parkinson's disease. We found two studies that looked at changing drinks to be thicker. One study looked at how different thicknesses of drinks affected 351 people with dementia right away. The other study looked at how thicker drinks affected 260 people with dementia over three months. The thicker drinks helped some people swallow better right away, but in the longer study, more people got sick with pneumonia when they drank the thickest drinks. We don't know if changing food or drinks is good for people with dementia in the long run because there haven
Scientists studied 788 women in six different tests. They wanted to see if a type of IVF called "natural cycle" was as good as the regular kind of IVF. They found that there was no big difference between the two types of IVF when it came to having a baby. If a woman had a 53% chance of having a baby with regular IVF, she would have a 34% to 53% chance with natural cycle IVF. They also found that there was no big difference in other things like getting pregnant, having more than one baby, or having problems with the pregnancy. One test showed that
We looked at 12 studies with 984 people who did Tai Chi and some who didn't. We only used information from 811 people in our final report. The people in the studies were between 61 and 74 years old and did Tai Chi for six weeks to one year. We found that Tai Chi helped people walk farther and breathe better, but we're not sure if it helps with feeling short of breath or improving quality of life. Tai Chi is safe for people with COPD to do. We need more studies to figure out the best way to do Tai Chi for people with COPD.
We looked at 72 tests with 2470 people. We added 35 new tests to our review. The tests were different and some were not reported well. We found that virtual reality games did not help people's arm and hand movements more than regular therapy. But, when people did virtual reality games in addition to regular therapy, they did better. We did not find enough evidence to say if virtual reality games helped with walking, balance, thinking, or quality of life. We did not find any big problems with using virtual reality games. We found that the time since the stroke, how bad the stroke was, and the type of
We looked at five studies with over 1,000 people to see if adding or replacing a medicine called fluoroquinolones in the treatment for tuberculosis (TB) would work better. None of the studies were less than six months long. In one study, they added levofloxacin to the regular treatment and we don't know if it helped or not. In three other studies, they replaced a different medicine with moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, or ofloxacin and we don't know if it helped or not. There is also not enough evidence to know if using fluoroquinolones for four
