This text says that 38 studies with 7843 children showed that educational interventions for children and parents significantly reduced emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and unscheduled doctor visits. However, there's not enough data on other outcomes like lung function, quality of life, or symptoms. Asthma education can lower the risk of future emergencies, but it's unclear what type of education is most effective in reducing acute care use.
This study involved 130 studies with 8341 participants, where 4588 received ketamine and 3753 were controls. Various surgeries were included. Ketamine doses varied, and the risk of bias was generally low or uncertain. The main analysis was not stratified by surgery type or other factors. Ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption and pain at rest and during movement at 24 and 48 hours. Results were consistent across different factors. No analysis by dose was possible, and there was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. The quality of evidence was downgraded if small-study effects were present. Ketamine
Five MSP/RESA vaccine trials with 217 participants were studied. All reported on safety, and two on effectiveness. No severe side effects were found at doses of 13-15 µg of each antigen (39-45 µg total). One small trial with 17 non-immune participants showed no change in parasite growth rates. In the second trial with 120 children in Papua New Guinea, clinical malaria episodes were not reduced, but MSP/RESA reduced parasite density in children not pretreated with antimalarial drugs. The vaccine reduced infections with the 3D7 parasite subtype but not the FC27 subtype. The MSP
This text discusses four studies with 125 participants that examined the effects of electromagnetic fields on bone healing. Most data focused on non-union of the tibia. Although all studies were blinded and randomized, they had limitations. The main measure of effectiveness was the percentage of participants whose fractures healed at a specific time. The overall effect was small and not statistically significant, with considerable clinical and statistical differences between studies. A sensitivity analysis showed that the effect remained non-significant at 24 weeks. No reduction in pain was found, and no study reported functional outcomes. One trial reported two minor complications. The current evidence is inconclusive and insufficient to inform
In this review, 1831 participants were divided into two groups: drain (915) and no drain (916) across 12 trials. Only two trials with 199 participants had a low risk of bias. Most trials involved patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Participants' average age ranged from 48 to 63 years, and the proportion of females was between 55% and 79%. No significant differences were found in short-term mortality, serious adverse events, or quality of life between the two groups. However, the drain group had a lower rate of day-procedure discharges and longer operating times. There
This text discusses 49 trials with 3639 participants that tested 38 different herbal medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. All trials were conducted in China and had low quality, making their positive results questionable. There was not enough information on side effects, and most trials had very low methodological quality. Due to this, conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of these herbal medicines cannot be made. There is no evidence to support the use of Chinese herbal medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and no well-designed trials have been conducted.
This review included five studies with 1382 patients, all having advanced prostate cancer. The studies were small and short-term, with few reported events. Only one study examined biochemical outcomes, finding no significant differences between IAS and CAS for various Gleason scores. However, IAS showed a reduction in biochemical progression for patients with Gleason scores above 6. Adverse events were mainly reported, with one trial showing no difference between IAS and CAS, except for impotence, which was lower in the IAS group. Data comparing IAS and CAS is limited due to small sample sizes and short durations. No data is available for overall
We found 12 studies with 7,119 participants that looked at the use of IUDs after abortion. Five studies compared immediate and delayed IUD insertion. Immediate insertion had a higher risk of expulsion, but overall IUD use was higher after six months compared to delayed insertion. Moderate quality evidence shows that immediate IUD insertion after abortion is safe and practical, but expulsion rates are higher compared to delayed insertions.
A small study looked at the effects of meditation on patients with acute leukemia. Of the 91 participants, only 42 completed the six-month trial. The study had a high risk of bias and very low-quality evidence due to missing data and small sample size. Meditation may improve quality of life and reduce depression, but its effects on survival, fatigue, anxiety, sleep, and adverse events are unclear. More high-quality trials are needed to understand meditation's effects on patients with blood-related diseases.
We found three studies with 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The studies differed in quality, vaccine used, follow-up time, and outcomes measured, so they couldn't be combined for analysis. Two of the three studies had high or unclear risk of bias. In total, 23% of vaccinated children developed varicella, compared to 78% of unvaccinated children. Most vaccinated children who got varicella had mild cases. In the studies, most participants received the vaccine within three days of exposure; there were too few cases to determine the effectiveness of the vaccine given later. No study reported on side
This review included 12 studies with 4704 participants. It compared various antibiotic regimens for preventing infections during surgery. All trials had a high risk of bias, and there was not enough similarity between them to perform a meta-analysis. The overall death rate was 1.0%, and there were no significant differences in death rates or serious side effects between the different antibiotic groups. None of the trials reported on quality of life, hospital stay length, or healthcare resource use. A total of 5.5% of people developed surgical site infections (SSIs), and 1.0% developed SSIs due to MRSA. In
Two trials with 116 women compared home and hospital management for PPROM. The trials were too small to properly assess outcomes. Both studies had strict criteria and few eligible women. Women were monitored for 48-72 hours before being assigned to a group. There was not enough evidence to determine differences in perinatal mortality, serious neonatal issues, or other factors. There was a higher chance of caesarean section in hospital-managed women, but results should be taken cautiously. Home care led to shorter inpatient stays, more satisfaction, and lower costs. The review suggests larger trials are needed to measure differences in outcomes, maternal
Two common methods for closing skin after a caesarean are non-absorbable staples and absorbable sutures. Both have similar rates of wound infection and complications, especially with Pfannenstiel incisions. However, staples may have different effects depending on the incision type. Staples have a higher risk of skin separation, leading to reclosure, but this varies across trials. Most staples are removed within four days after birth. There is no clear evidence on the best skin closure method after a caesarean. Staples and sutures have similar outcomes regarding infection, pain, and appearance. If staples are removed on day three
We found 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 821 participants studying green and black tea's effects on cardiovascular health. Green tea was tested in seven trials, and black tea in four. The ongoing trial is examining green tea powder capsules. No studies reported cardiovascular events. Black tea significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and blood pressure over six months, but only a few trials contributed to the analysis, and they were at risk of bias. Green tea also significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure, but the results were not stable and only a few studies contributed to the analysis. When both
Two small trials with 23 participants were included in the review. Participants might have had lung issues. No information on oral steroid use was provided. No major differences were found in the studies for lung function and symptoms. One study showed a significant difference in airway resistance, but its clinical relevance is unclear. Due to small sample sizes and methodological issues, the study results cannot be applied to steroid tapering. A search in August 2010 found no new studies for the review. There is currently insufficient evidence to support using azathioprine for chronic asthma as a steroid alternative. Larger, long-term studies with specific steroid reduction plans are
In this update, 56 studies (4068 participants) were included, mostly involving breast cancer patients. A meta-analysis of fatigue data showed that exercise was more effective than control interventions. Exercise benefits were seen during or after cancer therapy, particularly for breast and prostate cancer. Aerobic exercise reduced fatigue, while resistance training and alternative exercises were not significant. The updated review concludes that aerobic exercise is beneficial for cancer-related fatigue during and after therapy, specifically for solid tumors. More research is needed to determine the best exercise type, intensity, and timing.
We reviewed 1796 records and found five eligible trials involving 3427 adults aged 16 to 65. These trials were conducted in Germany, Italy, and Belgium. The risk of bias was low for overall survival (OS) but high for other outcomes due to the lack of therapy blinding. All trials reported results for OS and progression-free survival (PFS). The addition of the EORTC 20012 trial showed that BEACOPP escalated treatment increases OS and PFS compared to the ABVD treatment. However, there is no evidence for a difference in treatment-related mortality or overall secondary malignancies between the two treatments
We reviewed 15 studies with 1835 cancer patients and found that psycho-educational interventions had similar return-to-work (RTW) rates and no difference in quality of life compared to standard care. Physical training programs also showed no significant improvement in RTW or quality of life. Less radical medical treatments had similar RTW rates and no difference in quality of life compared to more radical treatments. Multidisciplinary interventions, which combined physical, psycho-educational, and vocational components, led to higher RTW rates but no difference in quality of life. Overall, moderate quality evidence suggests that multidisciplinary interventions can improve RTW for
This update includes no new trials. Four trials with over 13,000 women from the UK and Ireland were analyzed. Three trials were funded by hospitals, and one by the Scottish government. Two trials had no declarations of interest, while the other two did not mention them. The studies had a low risk of bias, and the 2012 review results remain unchanged. The data suggests that women who had admission CTG may have a higher chance of caesarean section compared to those with intermittent auscultation, but the difference was not statistically significant. There was no clear difference in instrumental vaginal birth and perinatal mortality rate between
This review included 32 studies, but it was not possible to combine the data due to different culture media being compared. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and most found no difference between the media. Six studies reported clinical pregnancy rate, with one suggesting Quinn's Advantage had higher rates than G5. However, this study had low-quality evidence. Adverse effects were reported in some studies, but no differences were found between the culture media. The health of offspring was not reported in any study. Most studies did not report funding sources or detailed methodology. The overall evidence quality was very low, with imprecision and poor reporting being
The search found 2847 citations, with 30 seeming relevant. After removing three duplicates and six publications with the same data, 23 original papers remained. However, none met the inclusion criteria, so data extraction and quality assessment were not possible. The review question about breast cancer diagnosis communication methods remains unanswered due to a lack of randomized trials. Ethical concerns may contribute to this research gap. Future studies should explore ethically sensitive designs to inform practice. A review focusing on communication methods during the first consultation visit might provide more reliable evidence and address ethical dilemmas.
We added two new papers, making a total of 17 RCTs with 1006 participants. One new study added 113 participants. There was a significant decrease in chest pain and increase in pain-free days in the first three months after the intervention. This effect lasted up to nine months. However, there was no effect on pain severity or frequency from three to twelve months. Due to the nature of the interventions, therapists couldn't be blinded, and three studies had a high risk of bias. There was also high heterogeneity, so results should be interpreted with caution. The review suggests a modest benefit for psychological interventions, especially cognitive
We analyzed 30 trials with 4344 participants, testing 17 different drugs or treatments. Various antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers were studied, with azelastine vs. placebo being the most common comparison. There was a wide range of reported outcomes, and study quality varied, but the risk of bias was generally low. Trials only looked at short-term effects, lasting one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible for one comparison (olopatadine vs. ketotifen). There is some evidence that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers reduce seasonal allergic conjunctivitis symptoms compared to
Two studies were included in a review on tobacco prevention initiatives for Indigenous youth, with a third study ongoing. Both studies focused on community-based interventions for Native American populations, totaling 1505 participants. No significant differences were found in weekly smoking or smokeless tobacco use at 42 months follow-up, except for a decrease in smokeless tobacco use in one group. The second study showed positive changes in tobacco use, but these were not maintained at six months follow-up. Both studies had high or unclear risk of bias. The review could not conclude the effectiveness of tobacco prevention initiatives for Indigenous youth, highlighting the need for more research. Indigenous youth have
From six relevant reports, one trial with 72 women with sickle cell anemia met the criteria. The trial had unclear risk of bias and imprecise results. No maternal mortality was reported in either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion groups. Very low-quality evidence showed no significant differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, or severe maternal morbidity between the treatment groups. Low-quality evidence suggested that prophylactic blood transfusion reduced the risk of pain crisis compared to selective blood transfusion, but no differences were found in other outcomes. Some pre-specified maternal and infant outcomes were not reported in the trial. One small
We analyzed 67 clinical trials with 6197 participants, but all trials had a high risk of bias. Most comparisons showed no significant differences, and the few that did were based on single trials with small sample sizes. The only primary outcome with a difference in more than one trial was the number of complications, which was higher with radiofrequency dissecting sealer than the clamp-crush method. Among secondary outcomes, blood transfusion proportion was higher in the low central venous pressure group, blood transfusion quantity (red blood cells) was lower with fibrin sealant, and blood loss, hospital stay, and operating time were lower with
This text includes 23 trials with 724 people. Evidence supports using systemic retinoids and oral PUVA for improvement, and combining them is even better. Topical steroid with hydrocolloid occlusion is helpful, and low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics, and Grenz Ray Therapy may also be useful. Colchicine's effectiveness is unclear due to side effects, and topical PUVA is not proven effective. Short-term hydroxycarbamide treatment lacks evidence of effectiveness. Many interventions claim to improve PPP, but there's no standard assessment method. The ideal PPP treatment is still unknown, and better study
Nine trials studied the blood pressure-lowering effects of five loop diuretic drugs in 460 people with high blood pressure for an average of 8.8 weeks. The estimated blood pressure reduction was -7.9/-4.4 mmHg, but this may be an overestimate. The quality of evidence was low due to study biases and potential publication bias. No significant differences were found between the drugs, and dose-ranging effects could not be evaluated. The review did not provide a reliable estimate of side effects due to short trial durations and lack of reporting in many trials.
We analyzed 58 trials, with 48 of them involving 2849 participants who received either intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (1558 participants) or a control treatment (1291 participants). Most trials focused on low anaesthetic risk individuals undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Bupivacaine was the most common local anaesthetic used, and there were differences in the methods of instillation. No deaths were reported in the eight trials that provided mortality data. One participant experienced serious morbidity, and three trials reported no intra-operative complications. Twenty trials reported no serious adverse events among 715 participants who received
We reviewed 74 studies on malaria tests and grouped them by the antigens they detected. Types 1-3 tests detect HRP-2, while Types 4-5 tests detect pLDH. We compared these tests to microscopy and found that Type 1 tests had 94.8% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity, Type 2 tests had 96.0% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity, and Type 3 tests had 99.5% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity. Overall, HRP-2 tests had 95.0% sensitivity and 95.2
Five UK studies were reviewed, but our confidence in the results is low due to high bias risk and insufficient data. We're unsure if changing appointment length affects consultation length, referrals, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction. No studies reported on resource usage. There isn't enough evidence to support or oppose altering consultation lengths. Better trials focusing on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness are needed.
The search found 3952 abstracts, and three trials met the criteria. These trials were conducted in developed countries with 157 experienced participants who had virologic suppression. Most participants were male, and the studies had a high risk of biases. Some baseline characteristics varied among groups. No meta-analysis was performed due to variations in study design and follow-up. No significant difference in virologic suppression was found in the studies. Symptomatic hyperlactatemia was seen in one study, not present in another, and not reported in the third. Two studies showed a reduction in bone mineral density, limb fat, and increased trig
This review included ten trials with 1658 participants. Five trials had low risk of bias, and five had moderate risk. Six trials used recruitment maneuvers as part of an open lung ventilation strategy, which differed from the control group in various ways. Six studies reported mortality outcomes. Pooled data showed a reduction in ICU mortality but no difference in 28-day and in-hospital mortality. There was no increased risk of barotrauma. The results are based on five trials with an open lung ventilation strategy, making interpretation difficult. A ventilation strategy with recruitment maneuvers reduced ICU mortality without increasing barotrauma risk but had no effect on other
This review included 15 studies with 687 participants, but the study quality was low and sample sizes were often small. Some combined effects were analyzed, but no significant differences were found between treatment and control groups. Relaxation therapy reduced the use of 'as needed' medications in two studies, but there was no significant difference in lung function or depression levels. Quality of life improved after cognitive-behavioral therapy in two studies, and bio-feedback therapy showed a significant difference in peak expiratory flow in two studies. However, the findings were inconsistent, possibly due to different interventions and trial design flaws. The review couldn't draw firm conclusions
This review included 35 studies with 6785 participants, focusing on antidepressants and benzodiazepines for treating panic disorder. The evidence quality was low, and no significant differences were found between the two treatments in terms of response rate. Some evidence suggested that benzodiazepines may have fewer dropouts and that SSRIs are better tolerated than TCAs. However, the studies had limitations, such as small participant numbers and lack of detailed information on methods and adverse effects. In conclusion, the choice of antidepressant or benzodiazepine should be made by clinicians on an individual basis, considering the patient's needs and available
This text discusses a study of 29 trials with over 1,700 participants who have pancreatic cancer. Three studies compared plastic stents to surgery, showing fewer complications but a higher risk of blockage before death. There was a slight trend towards lower 30-day death rates with plastic stents. One study compared metal stents to surgery, showing lower costs and better quality of life. Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents, with metal stents having a lower risk of blockage but no significant difference in other risks. Comparing different plastic stents, only one type had better results. Adding an anti-reflux valve improved T
We analyzed five studies with 444 arterial cannulations in children. Four studies compared ultrasound to touch, and one compared ultrasound to sound-based assistance. The risk of bias varied, and some studies lacked detail. It was not possible to blind practitioners in all studies, which may affect the results. Only two studies reported complication rates. Our analysis showed that ultrasound guidance has better success rates at the first attempt (moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications like blood clots (moderate-quality evidence). Our results suggest, but don't confirm, that ultrasound guidance may be more beneficial for infants and small children, and that expertise in ultrasound may improve success
We looked at one small study from the Netherlands and three Canadian studies from the 1970s and 80s. The Netherlands study found that young men who watched movies with less alcohol content drank less. The Canadian studies had mixed results on the effects of alcohol advertising bans. Overall, there is not enough strong evidence to support or oppose alcohol advertising restrictions. More high-quality research is needed to better understand the effects of these restrictions.
Eight trials with 182 infants were analyzed, comparing high and low MCT formulas. No significant differences were found in short-term growth, weight gain, length gain, or head circumference gain. There was no clear evidence of formula tolerance or effects on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Long-term growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes were not studied. In conclusion, neither formula type showed improved short-term growth or fewer adverse effects. More research is needed to study long-term outcomes, formula tolerance, and larger populations for NEC incidence.
We analyzed a small trial with 34 participants comparing transcervical amnioinfusion to no amnioinfusion. The trial had a high risk of bias due to its small size and lack of information. No clear effects on postpartum endometritis or neonatal infection were found. The trial did not report on perinatal death or severe morbidity. There was no significant difference in caesarean section rates or maternal antibiotic treatment duration. The amnioinfusion group had a slightly lower temperature at delivery. Most secondary outcomes were not reported in the study. There is not enough evidence to fully evaluate the effectiveness and safety
Three studies with 1620 participants met the criteria. Mini-Cog sensitivities were 0.99, 0.76, and 0.99, while specificities were 0.93, 0.89, and 0.83. Differences between studies prevented a combined analysis. All studies had methodological limitations and potential biases, especially in participant selection. There are few studies on Mini-Cog's accuracy in community settings. The limited number and methodological issues make it hard to recommend Mini-Cog for community cognitive screening. More well-designed studies comparing Mini-Cog to other tests are needed to determine its accuracy and
We analyzed 19 studies on three types of amphetamines for ADHD treatment, involving 2521 mostly middle-aged, Caucasian male participants. Most studies were conducted in the USA, short-term, and funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Amphetamines reduced ADHD symptoms but did not improve treatment retention. They also increased the number of patients who withdrew due to side effects. Different doses and drug-release formulations showed no significant differences in efficacy. Compared to other drugs, amphetamines did not show better improvement in ADHD symptoms. The studies' short duration and restrictive criteria limit the findings' validity, and the overall evidence quality is low.
This updated review includes 10 studies with 811 participants, focusing on the effects of vitamin D on chronic pain. The studies varied in quality, conditions examined, vitamin D dosage, additional treatments, and reported outcomes. Only two studies showed pain improvement, while others showed no significant difference between vitamin D and placebo. Adverse events and withdrawals were rare, with no notable differences between the two groups. The evidence now includes more studies and participants, but it is unlikely that vitamin D has a significant positive effect on various chronic pain conditions. Further research is needed to determine if vitamin D can benefit specific types of chronic pain.
This text discusses 41 studies with over 200 practices and 48,000 patients. The studies varied in methods, participants, and results. Many had poor quality. All studies used multiple strategies, targeting health professionals, care organization, or both. Patient education was added in 15 studies. Professional interventions improved processes, but patient outcomes were unclear. Organizational interventions, like follow-up arrangements, had positive effects on processes. Adding patient education or enhancing nurses' roles improved patient health outcomes. Multifaceted professional interventions can improve diabetes management, as can organizational interventions like tracking systems or regular patient contact. Including patient-oriented interventions and involving nurses
Five trials with 1503 women met the criteria. They compared different contraceptives, including oral, patch, ring, and intrauterine methods. There were no significant differences in effectiveness or continuation between methods. One group using oral contraceptives had more women stop for personal reasons. A trial comparing two intrauterine methods showed similar effectiveness. In three trials, at least 75% of women continued using intrauterine methods for 6 to 36 months. The overall evidence quality was moderate to low due to trial design or reporting issues. Different doses in intrauterine methods didn't affect effectiveness over three years. Continuation
This text discusses a study with 88 trials, including various allergy types. The results show that immunotherapy significantly reduces asthma symptoms, medication use, and bronchial hyper-reactivity. However, there are potential local and systemic side effects. The benefits of immunotherapy may be similar to inhaled steroids, but the risk of adverse effects should be considered.
We found no new studies to include in this update, so the total remains at six trials with 1297 patients. Five trials had low bias risk, and one had unclear bias risk. Lung-protective ventilation significantly reduced 28-day mortality and hospital mortality. However, overall mortality wasn't significantly different when using a specific pressure in the control group. There wasn't enough evidence for other outcomes, and differences in the trials made interpreting results difficult. Mortality was reduced at day 28 and the end of the hospital stay, but long-term effects are unknown. Lower tidal volume ventilation is becoming a standard treatment for acute respiratory issues, making
We analyzed 15 studies with 1833 participants and found that none had high-quality methods. Results showed that waking up from anesthesia took longer with isoflurane than propofol, while sevoflurane and propofol had similar times. There was less nausea and vomiting with propofol compared to sevoflurane or isoflurane, but more risk of blood pressure changes. Brain relaxation results were mixed. Overall, intravenous and inhalation techniques had similar outcomes, but our findings are based on low-quality evidence from limited studies. Isoflurane caused longer wake-up times.
Four trials with 15,936 hypertensive participants were analyzed. The average age was 75.4 years, and the average blood pressure was 171/86 mmHg. The combined results showed no significant difference in dementia incidence between treatment and placebo groups. There was also no significant improvement in cognitive function (MMSE) with treatment. Blood pressure levels were significantly reduced in the treatment group. Adverse effects causing treatment discontinuation showed no significant difference between groups. Quality of life data could not be analyzed. The analysis faced issues as many control subjects received antihypertensive treatment, making it a comparison between different treatments. There
We analyzed 12 trials with 3474 patients. Most articles had unclear bias risk due to limited data, but this likely didn't affect the results. PTCRA didn't improve patient outcomes in non-complex lesions. In complex lesions, there were no significant differences in re-stenosis rates between PTCRA/PTCA and PTCA alone at six months and one year. The effectiveness of PTCRA in in-stent re-stenosis is unclear. Compared to angioplasty alone, PTCRA/PTCA didn't increase the risk of major adverse cardiac events during hospitalization. However, PTCRA
Three studies with 333 participants were analyzed, two focusing on patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and one on patients with bronchiolitis in Italy. All studies used nebulized rhDNase compared to a placebo, along with other treatments. The results showed no significant benefits from using nebulized rhDNase. The control group had shorter hospital stays and better clinical improvements. The largest study found no difference in oxygen use or ICU admissions. In one study, some patients with atelectasis improved after using nebulized rhDNase. No significant difference in side effects was found. Overall, the use of
Two studies with 181 participants were analyzed, comparing percutaneous technique (116 participants) and cut-down femoral artery access (65 participants). One study had a small sample size and poor reporting, while the other was larger and well-conducted. No significant difference in mortality, aneurysm exclusion, major complications, wound infection, or long-term complications was found between the two groups. However, the percutaneous approach was faster in surgery time. The evidence quality was moderate due to limited studies and low event numbers. More research is needed, and an ongoing study may provide better evidence in the future.
Two trials were included in the study. The sponge was less effective in preventing pregnancy compared to the diaphragm in both trials. In the US trial, the sponge had a higher pregnancy rate (17.4) than the diaphragm (12.8). In the UK trial, the sponge had a higher pregnancy rate (24.5) than the diaphragm (10.9). The sponge also had higher discontinuation rates after 12 months. Allergic reactions were more common with the sponge, but discomfort varied between trials. No new trials have been found since the initial review. The sponge was less effective than the di
Sixteen studies were considered for a review, with six being included. Three focused on prevention and three on improvement of cognitive deficits. A meta-analysis couldn't be conducted due to differences in interventions. Two studies examined drug interventions for preventing cognitive deficits, with mixed results and some adverse events. The third study looked at a rehabilitation program but didn't provide a statistical comparison. Three studies explored drug interventions for treating cognitive deficits, with some improvements and adverse events reported. However, these studies had small sample sizes. No eligible non-drug studies were found for improving cognitive deficits. Many studies had limitations and high risks of bias. There is some evidence supporting
This review included two studies with 26 participants, aged 17 to 55, that examined the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment for sensory deficit caused by iatrogenic injury. Results showed some improvement in the lip and chin areas after laser therapy compared to placebo, but the estimates were imprecise. The overall quality of the evidence was very low due to limitations in the studies, indirectness of the evidence, and imprecision of the results. No studies reported on pain, difficulty eating or speaking, taste, quality of life, or adverse events. There is a need for more clinical trials to investigate treatments for such nerve injuries,
Two studies with 281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses were included, but their differences made it unsuitable to combine their data. The first study, with 161 pregnancies, focused on women with a history of diabetes. It found no significant difference between using combined estrogen and progestogen and a placebo for miscarriage, perinatal death, and preterm birth. However, using combined estrogen and progestogen increased the risk of maternal reproductive system cancer. No differences were found for other secondary outcomes. The second study focused on women who had in-vitro fertilization (IVF). It found no difference in miscarriage rates between
This text discusses a review of 14 studies on antidepressants, including TCAs and SSRIs, compared to placebos. There were 1364 participants in the intervention groups and 919 in the placebo groups. Most studies lasted 6-8 weeks. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were more effective than placebos, with TCAs having a slightly higher success rate. The number of patients needed to treat (NNT) for positive results ranged from 7 to 16 for TCAs and 7 to 8 for SSRIs. The number of patients needed to harm (NNH) due to side effects
This update found no new studies. Nine existing studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) compared ibuprofen to placebo or other treatments. All studies used single doses of medication. Ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than placebo for 2-hour pain-free, 2-hour headache relief, and 24-hour sustained headache relief. Ibuprofen 200 mg was also more effective than placebo for 2-hour pain-free and 2-hour headache relief, but the higher dose was better. Soluble ibuprofen 400 mg worked faster than standard tablets for 1-hour headache relief. Adverse events were mostly mild
We analyzed 43 studies (3,497 participants with dry eye) but faced challenges in comparing them due to differences in criteria, interventions, and measurements. It is unclear if various over-the-counter (OTC) artificial tears offer similar relief, but 0.2% polyacrylic acid-based tears seemed more effective than 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based tears in two studies (175 participants). Other artificial tears showed mixed or no differences in results. OTC artificial tears appear generally safe but may have side effects. The evidence quality is low due to biases and poor reporting. We found 18 more trials (2,
A study with 136 patients examined the effects of keeping lamivudine in second-line treatments for HIV. No difference in virological outcomes was found between those who kept lamivudine and those who didn't. Two other small studies also found no difference in viral suppression after six months. No trials compared boosted protease inhibitors (PIs) or nucleoside combinations after first-line failure. Observational studies show promising short-term results with boosted PI-based treatments in limited-resource settings. Limited evidence exists for second-line therapies in patients who fail first-line treatment. One trial and two low-quality studies suggest no difference in virological
We analyzed 133 studies with 844,206 participants, evaluating seven prespecified and 69 non-prespecified index tests. The tests were for difficult face mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, tracheal intubation, and failed intubation. The risk of bias varied across studies, with low risk for patient selection and flow and timing, and unclear risk for reference standard and index test. For difficult laryngoscopy, the upper lip bite test had the highest sensitivity. For difficult tracheal intubation, the modified Mallampati test had the highest sensitivity. For difficult face mask ventilation, only the
A total of 63 studies with 8014 participants were analyzed, with 56 trials involving infants and young children. These trials had different definitions for acute diarrhea and its end, as well as varying risk of bias. They were conducted in various settings and had diverse organisms, dosages, and participant characteristics. No negative side effects were linked to probiotics. Probiotics reduced diarrhea duration, but the effect size varied among studies. On average, probiotics significantly reduced diarrhea duration, risk of diarrhea lasting 4 or more days, and stool frequency on day 2. The differences in effect size were not explained by factors such as study
We included one pilot study comparing nidotherapy-enhanced standard care to standard care alone (52 participants) for 18 months. The study looked at short-term (up to 6 months) and medium-term (6-12 months) effects. Nidotherapy-enhanced care showed better social functioning, but results were not statistically significant. Engagement with non-inpatient services favored the intervention group, with significant results in the short term but not medium term. People leaving the study early favored the intervention in the short term, but results were not significant. Adverse effects, such as death, favored the intervention but were not statistically significant. Mixed results
We found two new studies with classic design and one with an EERW design. In total, eight studies were included. Five of these studies (3283 participants) had a classic design where participants were given pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or a placebo for 8 to 13 weeks. No studies had active comparators. The studies had a low risk of bias, but the method used for analyzing primary outcomes could overestimate the treatment effect. Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing significant pain reduction (high-quality evidence). About 14% of participants with placebo
One trial with 135 women with mild pre-eclampsia was included, and six more studies are being assessed. The trial compared magnesium sulphate to a placebo and had a low risk of bias. It didn't report any primary outcomes for this review. No significant differences were found in Apgar scores, gestational age at birth, postpartum bleeding, or caesarean section rates. However, more maternal side effects were reported in the magnesium sulphate group. There isn't enough evidence to determine the effectiveness and safety of magnesium sulphate for protecting a full-term baby's brain. More high-quality trials are needed to
Four studies were included in the review, with two using combination therapies and two using counseling for smoking cessation. The results showed a significant positive effect for the intervention, but this became non-significant after further analysis. There is a notable health disparity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations regarding smoking-related issues. The review emphasizes the lack of evidence for effective smoking cessation interventions in Indigenous populations, limiting its external validity and conclusions. The limited evidence suggests that targeted interventions can help, but more rigorous trials are needed to address the health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations.
We analyzed 13 studies with 5686 patients and found that about 50% had a high risk of bias, while 25-30% had a low risk. Despite the high risk of bias, these studies were included due to their low weight in the meta-analysis. 75% of the studies had a low risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias. All studies reported some form of hospital mortality. We divided the studies into two subgroups: high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies). The risk ratio (RR) for mortality was 1.02 for general intensive care
This text discusses six studies with 478 participants that looked at infant pain during blood sampling. The results showed that venepuncture (needle in a vein) caused less pain than heel lance (pricking the heel) in 288 infants who didn't receive a sweet solution. When a sweet solution was given, venepuncture still caused less pain. Venepuncture also required fewer repeat skin punctures, with only one needed for every three infants. Crying was less in the venepuncture group, and giving a sweet solution helped reduce pain further. The conclusion is that venepuncture, done by a skilled professional, is the better
Two small, low-quality studies with 52 women who had episiotomy wounds were included. Only one study reported data on wound healing within four weeks, but the results were not statistically significant. Only one trial reported on pain during intercourse at two and six months, with no significant difference between groups. This trial also showed more women in the secondary suturing group resumed intercourse by two months, but no difference at six months. Neither study provided data on pain, satisfaction with wound appearance, breastfeeding, or maternal anxiety/depression. There is not enough evidence to support or refute secondary suturing for managing episiotomy wounds. A well-designed trial
We analyzed 18 studies with 2521 participants, but 17 had poor methodology. The studies compared various medicinal herbs to antiviral drugs, making it difficult to combine results. Only three studies suggested that Chinese herbs might be effective in preventing and easing flu symptoms. One study found 'Ganmao' capsules more effective than amantadine, but with some side effects. There were no significant differences between 'E Shu You' and ribavirin. Ten studies reported mild side effects. Most herbs had similar effects to antiviral drugs, with few being superior. No serious side effects were reported. However,
We found 8 studies with 580 participants for this review. The studies looked at different treatments for catheter issues, but none compared the same treatments. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor design, broad criteria, low patient numbers, and industry involvement. Low certainty evidence suggests that thrombolytic therapy may help restore catheter function compared to placebo, but there's no data on the best dose or method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath using radiology techniques seems as effective as using a drug for immediate catheter management. Catheter patency is poor after using thrombolytic agents, with survival
We analyzed 17 trials with 22 treatment comparisons and 2674 patients. Fifteen trials reported tumor response results, and 11 trials reported overall survival data. There were 1532 deaths among 2116 women in trials comparing adding a drug to the treatment regimen versus the regimen alone. No significant difference in overall survival or time to progression was found. However, adding a drug improved tumor response rates but also increased side effects like hair loss, nausea, and low white blood cell count. In summary, adding a drug to the treatment regimen showed better tumor response in women with metastatic breast cancer but no difference in survival time or time
Ten studies with 1896 patients found no significant effect on inpatient mortality or long-term mortality. However, higher quality studies showed a larger, non-significant increase in inpatient mortality. Discharge to institutional care was reduced, and functional status at discharge improved for the NLU. Inpatient stay increased slightly, and early readmissions were reduced. One study compared NLU for chronically ill patients with ICU care, finding no difference in mortality or inpatient stay length. Early readmissions were reduced. Costs of care on the NLU were higher in the UK but lower in the US. Patients from NLU seemed better prepared for discharge
We reviewed 11 studies with 414 participants on therapeutic ultrasound for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The studies had varying levels of quality and bias. There is not enough evidence to show that one ultrasound treatment is better than another. Only two studies reported short-term overall improvement, with mixed results. There were no significant differences between groups receiving different ultrasound treatments or compared to other non-surgical interventions. Adverse effects were not reported, but more data is needed to determine the safety of therapeutic ultrasound. Overall, there is limited, poor-quality evidence suggesting that therapeutic ultrasound may be more effective than placebo for CTS. More rigorous studies are needed to
We looked at eight studies with about 10,000 participants. They tested pravastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, clofibrate, and conjugated oestrogen. The results showed no overall effect on stroke recurrence, but statin therapy had a small benefit in reducing future cerebrovascular events in people with a history of stroke or TIA. There was no proof that this treatment reduced overall death or sudden death. Three statin trials showed a decrease in serious vascular events. Statin therapy helps reduce major heart events in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA, but only slightly
This review included eleven campaigns that varied in design, settings, duration, content, and evaluation methods. Significant decreases in smoking prevalence were observed in California and Massachusetts statewide tobacco control campaigns. Some positive effects were seen in three other studies, and three large-scale campaigns showed significant decreases in tobacco consumption. Four out of eight studies showed positive effects on abstinence or quit rates. Comprehensive tobacco control programs with mass media campaigns can be effective in changing adult smoking behavior, but the evidence comes from a diverse group of studies with varying quality. Positive results were seen in Massachusetts up to eight years after the campaign and in California during periods of adequate funding and
We analyzed 24 studies with 2166 participants, and found that yoga can improve health-related quality of life, reduce fatigue, and decrease sleep disturbances compared to no therapy. It can also reduce depression, anxiety, and fatigue compared to psychosocial/educational interventions. However, yoga may not be more effective than other exercise programs. Overall, yoga is a recommended supportive intervention for improving health and well-being.
This text discusses a study comparing early post-operative imaging to no early imaging in 125 glioblastoma patients. Most patients had surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide treatment. The study had a high risk of bias and showed little or no difference in survival rates between the two groups at one and two years after diagnosis. No other outcomes were reported, and no evidence was found on other imaging schedules or economic evaluations. The impact of different imaging strategies on survival and health outcomes is largely unknown, and current schedules seem to be based on practicality rather than evidence. More research is needed to determine if early post-operative imaging affects
This text discusses three studies with 161 schizophrenia patients. Only two main outcomes had available data. There was no significant difference between chlorpromazine and metiapine groups in global state improvement and parkinsonism rates. Data for other key outcomes were not available. Despite chlorpromazine being a common treatment for schizophrenia, there is no high-quality evidence comparing it to metiapine. The need to compare these drugs may not be clinically relevant, and future research on this topic seems unlikely.
We found 23 studies for review. Probiotics didn't perform better than placebos. Nitroimidazole antibiotics lowered the risk of Crohn's disease recurrence but had more serious side effects. Mesalamine and Azathioprine/6MP also reduced recurrence risk without increasing serious side effects. Mesalamine had a higher risk of endoscopic recurrence but a lower risk of serious side effects compared to Azathioprine/6MP. There's not enough data on infliximab, budesonide, tenovil, and interleukin-10. Nitroimidazole antibiotics, mesalamine, and
We analyzed seven trials (825 participants) with varying levels of bias. The studies looked at different psychosocial interventions for reducing alcohol consumption among people using illicit drugs. These interventions included cognitive-behavioral coping skills training, twelve-step programs, brief interventions, motivational interviewing, and brief motivational interviewing. No significant differences were found between the interventions in terms of alcohol abstinence, retention in treatment, or alcohol-related harm. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes ranged from very low to moderate. Overall, there is low to very low-quality evidence suggesting no difference in effectiveness between these interventions, and brief interventions are not superior to assessment-only or
We analyzed 23 trials with 1586 participants, with 58% from five unpublished studies. Quinine was compared to various treatments, and the most common dosage was 300 mg/day. No new trials were found in 2014. The risk of bias in the trials varied, and only a few described randomization and allocation concealment well. Quinine reduced cramp number, intensity, and days but not duration. More people experienced minor side effects with quinine, mainly gastrointestinal symptoms. Serious side effects were not significantly different from placebo. Quinine (200-500 mg daily) reduces cramp number, intensity, and days
We found seven studies with 406 participants, including 118 who served as their own controls. Three studies focused on pregnant women with leg cramps (202 participants) and four on people with unexplained cramps (322 participants, including controls). Magnesium was compared to a placebo in six studies and to no treatment in one study. For unexplained cramps, mainly in older adults, there were small, non-significant differences in cramp frequency and intensity when comparing magnesium to a placebo. There was also no significant difference in the percentage of people experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate. Cramp duration and intensity
We looked at one study that examined a six-month home exercise program for 14 people with SMA, aged 10 to 48 years. The study had a high risk of bias since it was not fully blinded. Participants did strength training, but only half followed the aerobic exercise plan. The study measured walking distance, heart and lung fitness, and motor function, but found no significant differences between the exercise and usual care groups. The exercise group showed a small improvement in muscle strength. The study found no significant effects on fatigue and quality of life. The evidence quality was very low due to study limitations and imprecision. No serious side effects or
Two studies with 149 participants were analyzed. Both had issues with allocation concealment and blinding. One study (81 patients with neck nerve pain) showed that surgery was better than physiotherapy or neck brace for short-term pain relief, but no significant differences after one year. Another study (68 patients with mild neck-related issues) found no significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment after three years. Many cases were lost during follow-up. Both studies had bias risks and don't provide reliable evidence on surgery effects for neck conditions. It's unclear if surgery's short-term risks are worth the long-term benefits. More research is needed to determine
Nine studies were included in our analysis, consisting of five RCTs, one CCT, and three ITSs. Six studies compared phone consultations to regular care, with four conducted by doctors, one by a nurse, and one by a clinic clerk. Three studies compared phone consultations by different healthcare workers, such as nurses versus doctors and health assistants versus doctors or nurses. Three out of five studies found a decrease in GP visits, but two reported a significant increase in return consultations. Generally, at least 50% of calls were managed with phone advice alone. Seven studies examined emergency department visits, with six showing no difference between groups and one
We analyzed 84 trials (22,872 participants) to study the effects of motivational interviewing (MI) on alcohol consumption. The results showed moderate to low-quality evidence. At four or more months follow-up, MI showed positive effects on reducing the amount, frequency, and peak blood alcohol concentration. There was a slight effect on alcohol problems, but no effects on binge drinking, average blood alcohol concentration, drink-driving, or other risky behaviors. The duration of MI intervention did not affect the results. No harms related to MI were reported. Overall, the benefits of MI for preventing alcohol misuse were not significant or consistent enough to be relevant for policy
This review analyzed 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2210 participants with asthma. The trials focused on three types of inhaler training: face-to-face sessions, multimedia training (e.g., DVDs, apps, games), and technique feedback devices. The studies had varying follow-up periods, ranging from 2 to 26 weeks. Most of the evidence was considered low quality due to biases and imprecision in the estimates of effect. Enhanced inhaler technique education and multimedia training generally improved technique in most studies. However, the variety of checklists used made it difficult to assess the results reliably. The way and timing of
Three small studies with 226 participants were conducted. One study involved patients with presumed ischaemic stroke without CT verification, while the other two involved patients with CT-verified ICH. None of the studies provided data on the primary outcome (death and dependency). In the larger ICH study, there was no difference in death and disability between the mannitol and control groups. Case fatality was not reported in the ischaemic stroke study and did not differ between the mannitol and control groups in the ICH studies. Adverse events were not found or reported. Two studies reported changes in clinical condition, but there was no significant difference
Six trials with 425 patients on D-penicillamine and 258 on placebo were found. D-penicillamine showed significant benefits in reducing joint pain, overall pain, and inflammation compared to placebo. However, more people withdrew from the study due to side effects, including kidney and blood issues. D-penicillamine seems effective for rheumatoid arthritis, but has higher toxicity than other similar drugs. Its long-term effects are still unclear.
We looked at four low-quality trials involving Huangqi compounds in chemotherapy. Three studies compared intervention groups to a control group, while the fourth compared Huangqi to other Chinese herbs. None reported primary outcomes using CTC. Huangqi compounds reduced nausea, vomiting, and leucopenia rates and increased T-lymphocyte subsets. However, they didn't affect Immunoglobulins G, A, or M. Despite low-quality studies, results suggest Huangqi may help reduce chemotherapy side effects and stimulate immune cells. But, due to limitations, there's no strong evidence of benefit. No harm was found from using Chinese herbs. High-quality
We examined 394 titles, abstracts, and nine ClinicalTrials.gov records, including three RCTs with 866 participants aged 4-55 years with RP. One trial studied vitamin A, another DHA, and a third compared DHA and vitamin A to vitamin A alone. Bias risk was unclear in all RCTs. We didn't perform a meta-analysis due to differences in participants and interventions. No study reported the primary outcome, mean change of visual field at one year, or any toxicity or adverse events. No significant benefits of vitamin supplementation on visual field or acuity loss were found. Two trials reported significant differences
This text discusses three studies with 414 participants at risk of job loss, mostly with inflammatory arthritis (IA). The interventions aimed to prevent job loss and improve work functioning through work adaptations and personal support like counseling and education. The studies had different durations and methods, and all participants were recruited from rheumatology clinics. The trials investigated job loss, work absenteeism, and work functioning, with varying levels of bias and quality of evidence. The results showed mixed effects on job loss prevention, with one large study showing a significant reduction in job loss, while another had similar effects in both groups but with a high risk of bias. A small trial
We found three studies with 285 newborns from three countries, showing good quality. The studies found that giving arginine to premature babies reduced the risk of developing NEC (a serious gut condition) compared to a placebo. The evidence quality was moderate. Six babies needed to be treated with arginine to prevent one case of NEC. Arginine also reduced the risk of death related to NEC, but not overall death rates. No significant side effects were linked to arginine. The studies had a small number of participants, so more research is needed before recommending arginine as a treatment for preventing NEC in premature infants.
This update found no new trials to include. Four well-designed, double-blind studies with 1943 participants with acute sinusitis were analyzed. The studies compared INCS to placebo or no intervention for 15 or 21 days. Loss to follow-up rates ranged from 7% to 41%. The meta-analysis of three trials showed that participants receiving INCS had a higher likelihood of symptom improvement or resolution (73% vs. 66.4%; risk ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.18). Higher INCS doses had a stronger effect on symptom improvement or relief. No
Giving preventive vancomycin to eligible preterm infants lowered the occurrence of neonatal infections without affecting mortality, length of stay, or vancomycin toxicity. There isn't enough evidence to determine the risk of developing vancomycin-resistant bacteria. Low doses of preventive vancomycin can reduce infections in newborns, but the study methods may have influenced the results. There is a concern about resistant bacteria, but not enough evidence to confirm the risk. Few benefits have been shown for very low birth weight infants treated with preventive vancomycin, so routine use is not recommended at this time.
Fourteen reports of 13 RCTs were identified on dressings or topical agents for postoperative wounds healing by secondary intention. Wound healing: A single small trial of aloe vera vs gauze suggests delayed healing with aloe vera, but the results are unclear due to a large loss to follow up. A plaster cast on an amputation stump sped up wound healing compared to elastic compression (1 trial). No significant differences in healing were found for other dressing comparisons (11 trials). Pain: Gauze caused more pain than other dressings (4 trials). Patient satisfaction: Patients treated with gauze were less satisfied than
In 2014, we added 7 trials, totaling 11. These trials, published between pre-1985 and 2014, included 1482 women. They studied combined oral contraceptives (COCs), levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUS), progestin-only pills (POPs), and etonogestrel-releasing implants. Older studies often had unclear results. Most trials found no significant differences in breastfeeding duration, breast milk composition, or infant growth. Exceptions were mainly in older studies. Two of eight trials showed a negative effect on lactation. For
We found 10 studies from Australia, Singapore, and the USA on red-light cameras. They were grouped based on how well they accounted for certain factors. The results showed that red-light cameras are effective in reducing total casualty crashes. However, the evidence is less clear for total collisions, specific crash types, and violations. Most studies did not account for all factors, affecting their accuracy. Larger and better-controlled studies are needed.
This text discusses four trials with 494 participants studying the effects of different warfarin doses. The results show that a 10-mg warfarin dose has some benefits, but there is considerable uncertainty and inconsistency among the studies. No significant differences were found in terms of recurrent blood clots, major bleeding, minor bleeding, or hospital stay length. Overall, it is unclear whether a 10-mg or 5-mg dose is better for initiating warfarin treatment in patients with blood clots, and more research is needed to determine the optimal approach.
This text discusses seven trials with 555 participants that compared different care models for older people with hip fractures. None of the interventions were specifically designed for people with dementia. The trials had various follow-up times and were considered to have a high risk of bias. The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was low or very low, and there were no data for the primary outcome of health-related quality of life. There was limited evidence that some enhanced care models may help prevent delirium and reduce hospital stays for people with dementia who have hip fractures. However, the certainty of these results is low, and more research is needed to determine the best
We reviewed 4226 titles and found seven studies with 840 participants. These studies were diverse in participants, interventions, and outcomes. No significant differences in health outcomes were found, but some studies reported reduced hospital stays, decreased parental anxiety, improved child behavior, and increased parental satisfaction. One study reported better family functioning, while others found no impact on parental care burden or children's functional status. Home care was more expensive for providers but saved costs for families in some cases. Current research doesn't support reduced hospital services or readmission rates for children using home-based nursing, but shorter hospital stays were observed. No negative effects on physical health were
The 2016 update added more studies and data to the review, which now includes 7524 participants from 40 randomized controlled trials. The review compares Intensive Case Management (ICM) to standard care and non-ICM. Most studies had a high risk of selective reporting, and no studies provided data on relapse or significant improvement in mental state. 1. ICM vs. standard care: ICM slightly reduced hospital days per month and the number of people leaving the trial early. However, it may not make a significant difference in reducing death by suicide or unemployment. 2. ICM vs. non-ICM:
This review analyzed data from 25 trials to study the effectiveness of box training for laparoscopic surgery. Most trials had a high risk of bias. The results showed that box training led to faster task completion, fewer errors, and better performance compared to no training. However, there were no significant differences in technical skill improvement between different box training methods. The review's results may be affected by bias and random errors. More well-designed trials are needed to assess the long-term impact of box training on surgical skills and patient outcomes.
Two clinical trials were studied. One compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone and saline in 17 patients, finding hydrocortisone increased side effects and showed no improvement, leading to the trial's end. The other trial compared budesonide and prednisone in 18 patients, showing higher bilirubin levels after prednisone treatment but no other significant effects. There is no evidence to support or refute oral glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis, and using corticosteroids through a nasobiliary tube may cause severe side effects.
This text discusses 11 trials studying nutritional support timing and methods. Seven trials focused on early versus delayed support, with data showing a possible trend towards better survival and disability outcomes with early support. Seven trials compared parenteral and enteral nutrition, with some overlap in the trials. Results suggested a potential improvement in survival rates. One trial compared gastric and jejunal enteral nutrition, but no deaths occurred. More trials are needed to confirm these findings, focusing on nutritional outcomes as well as death and disability effects.
This text discusses a study that analyzed 57 studies with 34,390 participants to determine the effectiveness of digital interventions in reducing alcohol consumption. The results showed that digital interventions led to a decrease in alcohol consumption by about 3 UK units per week compared to minimal or no interventions. There was no significant difference between digital and face-to-face interventions in terms of alcohol consumption reduction. The most effective techniques in digital interventions were behavior substitution, problem solving, and credible source. The use of theories in these interventions was limited and not clearly linked to their effectiveness.
We reviewed 24 studies with 4233 participants, comparing benzodiazepines to placebo for panic disorder treatment. The studies' quality was poor, and all had unclear risk of bias. Benzodiazepines showed a possible advantage over placebo in treatment response, dropout rate, remission, and social functioning, but with low-quality evidence. However, more participants experienced adverse effects with benzodiazepines. The studies' validity is questionable due to potential unmasking, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. They also didn't examine long-term efficacy or risks of dependency and withdrawal. Our results provide limited guidance for clinical
We found 13 small trials (1520 participants) and three ongoing trials studying tai chi's effects on cardiovascular health. All studies had some risk of bias, and they varied in duration and style of tai chi. Participants included healthy individuals and those with hypertension or at risk of falling. No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality or non-fatal events, as most were short-term (one year or less). There was significant variation between studies, making it impossible to combine them statistically for cardiovascular risk. Nine trials measured blood pressure, with mixed results. Some found reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while others found no clear evidence of
This text discusses a study on the effectiveness of family-based interventions in preventing children and adolescents from starting to smoke. The study included 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with various intervention components, target behaviors, and participant ages. Most of the interventions were tested in the USA, with a few in Europe, Australia, and India. The study found moderate quality evidence that family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing smoking compared to no intervention. High-intensity programs, which typically addressed family functioning and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old, showed the strongest evidence for effectiveness. These programs encouraged authoritative parenting, which
Three studies with 451 participants met the criteria. They had different trial sizes and compared various treatments. The studies lasted 7-14 days. Two studies (127 participants) were included in a meta-analysis for nausea intensity. Dexamethasone resulted in less nausea but wasn't statistically significant. Adverse event frequency was similar between groups, and treatments were well tolerated. Limitations included non-standardized nausea measurements and different agents, dosages, and comparisons. Subgroup analysis by cancer type wasn't possible due to insufficient data. The evidence quality was downgraded to very low due to various biases and small participant numbers. Few studies assess
We analyzed 10 studies on using antibiotics to prevent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in high-risk children. The studies included children with HIV, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, cancer, and respiratory disorders in low birth weight neonates. The study durations ranged from one week to three years, and the quality of evidence was moderate for some groups. In HIV-infected children, there was no significant difference in tuberculosis incidence or mortality with antibiotic prophylaxis. However, one study showed reduced mortality with co-trimoxazole. Hospital admission rates decreased in one study using co-trimoxazole. No increased adverse
We analyzed nine studies with 519 participants, comparing different gases for pneumoperitoneum: nitrous oxide, helium, and room air versus carbon dioxide. The trials had a high risk of bias, and the evidence quality was very low. There was not enough evidence to determine the effects of nitrous oxide, helium, or room air on complications, pain, or serious adverse events. One small study suggested that room air might reduce hospital costs for laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The safety of these gases is still uncertain, and more research is needed. Future studies should compare various gases with carbon dioxide and focus on outcomes like complications, serious adverse
This review included 14 studies on dexamethasone in preterm infants. Eight studies with 303 participants looked at different dosages, while four studies with 762 infants examined early treatment initiation. Two studies compared continuous and pulse regimens, and two others compared standard and individualized courses. Results showed increased risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and abnormal neurodevelopment with moderate dosages compared to high dosages. No differences were found between moderate and low dosages or in early treatment initiation. Pulse therapy had a higher risk of death or BPD compared to continuous therapy. No differences were found in
This update includes eight trials with 996 people, comparing various steroidal agents to aspirin, placebo, or no treatment for heart disease risk. No significant differences were found between corticosteroid and aspirin-treated groups. Prednisone also did not reduce heart disease risk compared to aspirin. Adverse events were reported in three studies. Results should be taken cautiously due to the studies' age and risk of bias. There is little evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins to reduce heart valve lesions in acute rheumatic fever patients. New trials are needed to assess the effects of corticoster
We analyzed six studies with 12,294 participants from 79 communities. Two studies showed that insecticide spray reduced trachoma by 55% to 61%, but another study found it ineffective. One study found latrine provision reduced trachoma by 29.5%, but this was not statistically significant and not confirmed by a recent study. Health education reduced trachoma in one study, but another study found no effect. All studies had some methodological concerns. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of insecticides, latrine provision, and health education in reducing trachoma. More data is needed to determine the impact
This text discusses a review of 15 studies with 1043 participants who have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The review found that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) significantly reduced fatigue compared to usual care, with 40% of CBT participants showing improvement. However, results at follow-up were inconsistent. When comparing CBT to other psychological therapies, CBT was more effective in reducing fatigue. But again, follow-up results were inconsistent. Only a few studies compared CBT with other treatments or in combination with other treatments. In conclusion, CBT is effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared to usual care and other psychological therapies, but
A study with 46 people with sickle cell disease was conducted to examine the effects of vitamin D supplementation. Seven participants withdrew before the study began, leaving 39 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D or a placebo for six weeks. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow-up. The vitamin D group had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood compared to the placebo group, but the quality of evidence was moderate. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups, and the quality of evidence was low. The vitamin D group experienced fewer pain days compared to the placebo group, but the quality
This review is based on one study funded by various organizations and scholarships. It involved 26 children aged 4-12 with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause. The study compared two treatments: NDP-3 and ReST. The treatments were given in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks at an Australian university clinic. Speech pathology students delivered the treatments in English. Outcomes were assessed at different times, but this review focused on one-month post-therapy outcomes. Some participants resumed their usual treatment between one and four months post-treatment, so the long-term effects could not be analyzed without potential bias. The review found
Four trials with 268 participants met the criteria. All four used oral antibiotics. One study in Brazil had a high risk of bias, while the other three had low or unclear risk. The studies compared antibiotic treatment to placebo and were conducted in the US, UK, and Brazil. Only one study reported the effect of treatment on visual acuity, showing similar results between antibiotics and placebo. Antibiotics likely reduce the risk of recurrent retinochoroiditis compared to placebo, with similar results for acute and chronic cases. One UK study reported improved intraocular inflammation with treatment. Two studies noted increased risk of side effects in treated participants. Antibiotics
This text discusses a study of 43 trials involving mainly older people with hip fractures. The study compared different treatments and found that the Gamma nail had a higher risk of complications and reoperations than the sliding hip screw (SHS). The intramedullary hip screw (IMHS) also had more complications than the SHS, but similar results for other factors. The proximal femoral nail (PFN) showed no major differences compared to the SHS. Other nail and implant comparisons did not provide enough evidence to determine the best option. Intramedullary nails had fewer complications for certain types of fractures compared to fixed nail plates.
We found 183 articles, and 22 seemed potentially relevant based on their titles and abstracts. Only one study met our criteria and was included in the review. This study looked at 47 women who received either palliative surgery (27 women) or medical management with Octreotide (20 women) for ovarian cancer-related bowel obstruction. Women with poor health were not considered for surgery. Some women experienced serious complications or death after surgery, but overall, those who had surgery had better survival rates than those who received Octreotide. Quality of life and side effects were not well-documented. We only found low-quality evidence comparing these treatments
Four trials with 244 women with PCOS were included, studying simvastatin and atorvastatin for 6 or 12 weeks. There was no strong evidence that statins improved menstrual regularity, ovulation, hirsutism, or acne, either alone or with oral contraceptives. Statins did not significantly affect BMI but effectively lowered testosterone levels and improved cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides. However, they did not significantly impact HDL levels, HS-CRP, fasting insulin, or HOMA insulin resistance. No serious side effects were reported. While statins improve lipid profiles and reduce testosterone
The search found 1522 references, but only 22 articles were reviewed in full, and none met the inclusion criteria. The available data is only from single-arm studies on women with cervical cancer treated for vaginal bleeding using various methods. No new studies were found since the last review, and there is no evidence from controlled trials to support or refute any of the proposed interventions compared to radiotherapy. The choice of treatment depends on local resources. Radiotherapy is not easily accessible in resource-poor areas where advanced cervical cancer is common. This review highlights the need for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the benefits and risks of palliative treatments for vaginal
Three studies with 745 patients examined temozolomide combined with radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Temozolomide improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) when used in both treatment phases. However, it didn't significantly affect quality of life (QoL) and increased the risk of side effects. In recurrent high-grade gliomas, two studies with 672 patients found temozolomide didn't improve OS compared to standard chemotherapy but increased PFS in a specific group of GBM tumors. Side effects were similar between groups
Two studies fit our criteria. One study in Cambodia shows weak evidence that private contracts with international NGOs for district health management ('contracting-in') might improve healthcare access and use. Contracting-in increased antenatal care by 28% and public facility use by 14%, but didn't affect overall health outcomes. The other study shows weak evidence that periodic training over 18 months could improve district health managers' performance. In three Latin American countries, untrained managers had 2.4 to 8.3 times more deficiencies than trained ones. No studies on retaining district health managers met our criteria. There's weak evidence that contracting-in
Three studies with 123 people were included. Blinding methods were not reported, but bias is hard to avoid in comparing surgical and medical treatments. Two studies didn't describe randomization concealment. All studies reported on mortality, with deaths in two studies. No significant difference in mortality between treatment groups was found, but the analysis was underpowered. Six people died from various causes. Surgery led to reductions in pneumonia, chest deformity, and tracheostomy. Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay were measured but couldn't be combined due to reporting differences. Chest pain, tightness, bodily pain, and side effects
In a study of 12,877 participants, cerivastatin was found to effectively lower LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. The treatment period ranged from three to 12 weeks, and the effects were dose-dependent. Cerivastatin was more potent than fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin in reducing cholesterol levels. However, it did not have a significant effect on HDL cholesterol. The study had a high risk of bias for withdrawals due to side effects but a low risk for lipid measurements. The short duration of the trials and lack of reporting on adverse effects made it
We analyzed 28 studies with 6851 patients and found mostly low risk of bias. Remote ischaemic preconditioning showed little to no difference in reducing serum creatinine levels, need for dialysis, hospital stay length, or mortality. It may slightly improve acute kidney injury rates. Four serious adverse events occurred with iliac clamping, but it's unclear if cuff inflation increases adverse effects. Overall, remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation seems safe but doesn't confirm its effectiveness in reducing kidney injury during major cardiac and vascular surgeries.
We reviewed 12,490 citations and included 12 trials with 703 participants. Eight trials focused on treating post-stroke fatigue (PSF) and six of them provided data for meta-analysis. The intervention groups showed lower fatigue severity than control groups, but the beneficial effect was not seen in trials with adequate allocation concealment or blinding of outcome assessors. No trial focused on preventing PSF. Four trials investigated other post-stroke symptoms and did not show any benefit on reducing PSF. There is not enough evidence to support the efficacy of any intervention for treating or preventing fatigue after stroke. Future trials should have a more robust study
Three trials with 74 preterm infants studied treatments for high potassium levels. Only one study measured urine output. None of the trials had proper group allocation concealment. The trials had small sample sizes (12, 19, and 40 infants). In two trials, clinical staff knew the treatments and outcomes. One study found that glucose and insulin, compared to a different treatment, slightly reduced mortality. Another study found a significant decrease in severe brain bleeding. Albuterol inhalation changed potassium levels at four and eight hours after treatment, but no differences in mortality or other outcomes were found. No serious side effects were reported for insulin and
This text discusses a review of twelve trials that compared different treatments for a certain condition. The main treatments compared were intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE). The results showed that both treatments were similarly effective in improving disability after four weeks, with no significant differences in other measures. In children, IVIg seemed to speed up recovery compared to supportive care alone. Combining IVIg with PE or immunoabsorption did not show significant extra benefits. Adverse events were not more frequent with either treatment, but IVIg was more likely to be completed than PE. More research is needed to determine
We analyzed 28 clinical trials (9330 participants) and found that high levels of inspired oxygen during anesthesia and surgery were not associated with reduced mortality or surgical site infections. The quality of evidence was low, and more research is needed to determine the effects of high oxygen levels during surgery. In some subgroups, high oxygen levels were linked to a decrease in infections, but the quality of evidence was very low. Due to the potential risks and lack of strong evidence, we cannot recommend the routine use of high oxygen levels during surgery. More high-quality studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up are needed.
This text discusses a study on the use of oral antibiotics for treating children with otitis media with effusion (OME). Out of 25 trials, 23 were evaluated, and most were found to have a low to moderate risk of bias. The study found that oral antibiotics can help resolve OME in children, but they may also cause side effects like diarrhea, vomiting, or skin rash. The effect of antibiotics on short-term hearing is uncertain, and there is no evidence that they reduce the need for ventilation tube insertions. Additionally, the study found no data on the impact of antibiotics on speech, language, cognitive development, or quality
This text discusses 12 studies, including nine RCTs and three before-and-after studies, on the effects of low protein diets (LPDs) on kidney function and mortality. The results suggest that LPDs may slightly slow down kidney disease progression, but not significantly. There is limited data on the impact of LPDs on quality of life and costs. More long-term research is needed for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients. A six-month trial of protein restriction could be considered, with continuation only for those who respond best. Additionally, trials on different types of protein are needed.
We found 19 studies with 3480 people. Twelve studies had good quality, and seven had lower quality. For mild brain injury, providing proper information helps most people recover without needing more interventions. For moderate to severe injury, formal intervention is beneficial, and starting rehabilitation early leads to better results. Intensive programs help those in rehabilitation make faster progress, and outpatient therapy can maintain these improvements. A supportive environment with a group of patients is effective for severe brain injury rehabilitation. Limited evidence shows that specialist in-patient and community rehabilitation may offer extra benefits, but there are practical and ethical limitations. Different interventions are needed for different brain injury levels
This review included one trial with 176 women, which studied the effects of infant location and apparel on breastfeeding. The trial had four groups, with three combined as the intervention (rooming-in) group and one as the control (separate care) group. The primary outcome, duration of any breastfeeding, showed no difference between groups, with a median duration of four months. Exclusive breastfeeding at six months was not reported. Secondary outcomes showed a slightly higher frequency of breastfeeding per day for the rooming-in group, but a comparison was not possible due to the separate care group's fixed schedule. The rooming-in group had a significantly higher rate
This text discusses eight trials with 660 participants, most of which were of poor quality. The sanchi group showed better results than the control group in terms of death and dependency rates, neurological improvement, and Barthel index scores. The overall fatality rate was low, and few adverse events were reported. However, due to the small sample size and low-quality studies, a definite conclusion cannot be made. More well-designed trials are needed to confirm sanchi's benefits and safety for acute ischaemic stroke.
Fourteen RCTs were found, but only seven were included. Four RCTs looked at implant placement timing. Two RCTs compared immediate vs. delayed implants in 126 patients and found no significant differences. One RCT compared immediate-delayed vs. delayed implants in 46 patients. After 2 years, the immediate-delayed group had shorter time to functional loading, higher satisfaction, and better perimplant marginal mucosa. However, these differences disappeared after 5 years, and more complications occurred in the immediate-delayed group. One RCT compared immediate and immediately delayed implants in 16 patients for 2 years and
Two MPAC trials were found. The first trial compared clioquinol (PBT1) with a placebo in 36 patients, and 32 had enough data for analysis. There was no significant difference in cognition between the treatment and placebo groups at 36 weeks. One participant experienced neurological symptoms, possibly due to the drug. The second trial compared PBT2 with a placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia. There was no significant difference in cognition, but two executive function tests showed improvement in the PBT2 group. PBT2 had a good safety profile. There is no clear evidence that clioquinol
We reviewed 36 studies with 2999 participants who had pulmonary hypertension from various causes. The trials lasted an average of 14 weeks, with some up to 12 months. Two trials included children, and 19 trials had group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors showed improvements in their WHO functional class, walked further, and had a lower death rate compared to placebo. However, there were increased risks of side effects like headaches, gastrointestinal upset, flushing, and muscle aches. Data comparing PDE5 inhibitors to placebo while on other PAH-specific therapy were limited. Participants on PDE5
This updated review included 22 trials with 2193 participants who had regional anesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm, or elbow surgery. The trials were generally well-designed, but some had issues with blinding and allocation concealment. Results showed that multiple-injection techniques were more effective in reducing primary anesthesia failure and incomplete motor block compared to single or double injections. Tourniquet pain was also reduced with multiple injections. However, there were no significant differences in secondary analgesia failure, complications, and patient discomfort. Multiple injections took longer to perform than single or double injections, but there was no difference in time to readiness for surgery.
The search found 159 citations, and three studies met the criteria. All used beclomethasone to treat mild-moderate asthma in children. The studies lasted 7-12 months and showed a significant decrease in growth for those treated with beclomethasone, averaging -1.54 cm per year. It's unclear if this effect lasts or reverses after stopping treatment. The impact of other inhaled steroids is unknown. If needed, use the lowest effective dose and monitor the child's growth closely.
Three studies with 139 patients were analyzed. APD and CAPD showed no significant differences in mortality, peritonitis risk, dialysis modality switching, hernias, fluid leaks, catheter removal, hospital admissions, or residual renal function. One study found less peritonitis and hospitalization in APD patients when measured by episodes per patient-year. Another study found APD patients had more time for work, family, and social activities. APD has no major clinical advantages over CAPD but may be better for younger patients and those working or studying due to its psychosocial benefits. More research is needed to compare CAPD
We analyzed 37 trials with 9312 patients, comparing different treatments for Hodgkin's disease (HD). Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was found to be better than radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) in terms of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). CRT was also better for early and advanced stages of the disease. The higher risk of secondary malignancies (SM) with RT was mainly due to the need for more salvage therapy. CRT was better than CT for PFS and OS in early stages, but had a higher SM risk. Data was not enough to compare RT and CT.
We looked at 26 studies with 4893 participants and 27 treatment groups. Most studies were case series or uncontrolled trials, with one being a randomized controlled trial. Opioids were given orally, transdermally, or intrathecally. Many participants stopped due to side effects or not enough pain relief. Only 0.27% showed signs of addiction. All three methods reduced pain, but results varied. Quality of life and function findings were unclear. Many patients stopped long-term opioid use due to side effects or insufficient pain relief, but those who continued experienced significant pain relief. It's unclear if quality of life
The text discusses a study with 212 participants who had spinal cord injuries and severe pressure ulcers. Most participants were male, with an average age of around 58 years. The study compared the effects of oxandrolone, a medication, with a placebo on ulcer healing and side effects. The results were uncertain, as the evidence was of very low quality. It was unclear whether oxandrolone improved or worsened ulcer healing, and if it increased or decreased the risk of serious side effects. The study did not report on secondary outcomes like pain, hospital stay, wound size, infection, treatment cost, or quality of life.
We analyzed six studies with 8372 participants, all with potential bias. Four studies compared email to standard mail, and two compared email to usual care. There was no difference in preventive screening uptake, patient/caregiver understanding, and support between email and other methods. Results were unclear for patient/caregiver behaviors and actions. No significant difference was found in patient health status and well-being when comparing email to usual care. No data on healthcare professionals or harms were reported. The evidence for using email for disease prevention and health promotion information is weak and insufficient for clinical practice. Current studies provide inconclusive or no evidence for the outcomes
This review looked at 11 trials with 855 participants to compare the Epley maneuver with and without postural restrictions for treating vertigo. The results showed no significant difference in vertigo intensity or improvement, but there was a small increase in the success rate when postural restrictions were added (88.7% vs 78.2%). No serious side effects were reported, but some minor complications occurred. There was no benefit from adding mastoid oscillation or extra steps to the Epley maneuver. In summary, adding postural restrictions to the Epley maneuver can slightly improve its effectiveness without causing harm. However, it's
This text discusses a review of four studies with 231 participants, which compared different surgeries and medical treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. The studies had varying treatments and comparisons, but the results were similar. There were no significant differences in patient-reported symptom scores or quality of life measurements between the treatment groups. Two studies reported endoscopic scores, with one showing a significant improvement in the surgical group. Complication rates varied, with epistaxis being the most common complication for both medical and surgical treatments. The overall evidence is of very low quality and does not show that one treatment is better than another. Further research is needed
We analyzed eight trials (709 participants) from middle-income countries where zinc deficiency is a public health issue. Four trials compared zinc-fortified foods to unfortified foods, and four compared zinc-fortified foods with other nutrients to the same foods without zinc. The studies lasted between one and nine months and had varying levels of bias. Zinc-fortified foods increased serum or plasma zinc levels compared to foods without added zinc. However, there was no significant difference in underweight and stunting risk between participants consuming zinc-fortified foods and those consuming unfortified foods. Adding zinc to iron in wheat flour did not reduce zinc
This review included 11 studies with 3060 participants and found that non-steroidal antiandrogens were less effective than medical or surgical castration for advanced prostate cancer. The evidence quality was moderate, and the treatment had more side effects and increased the risk of treatment discontinuation. The effects on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression were unclear. Further research may impact results for patients with advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer, but it may not be necessary for men with metastatic prostate cancer. Future studies should be high-quality, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up and standardized measurements.
We identified eight trials, but excluded one due to non-comparable groups. The remaining trials involved 600,000 women aged 39-74. Three well-randomized trials showed no significant reduction in breast cancer deaths at 13 years, while four less well-randomized trials showed a significant reduction. Overall, the combined risk reduction was 0.81. Breast cancer mortality was found to be an unreliable outcome, biased towards screening. Well-randomized trials showed no effect on total cancer or all-cause mortality. Screened groups had more lumpectomies, mastectomies, and radiotherapy, but no difference in chemotherapy
This review included four studies with 522 women, but one study was not used in the analysis. Three studies compared 10,000 units hCG priming to no priming, and one compared 20,000 units hCG to 10,000 units hCG. Most studies had unclear risk of bias and low-quality evidence. No significant differences were found in live birth, pregnancy, or miscarriage rates between hCG priming and no priming. There was low-quality evidence suggesting hCG priming may reduce clinical pregnancy rates, but this was limited by the small amount of data. No information on adverse events or drug reactions
A total of 24 trials were studied, with 16 having usable data. The results showed that neither ERT nor HRT prevented cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women after 4-5 years of treatment. Negative effects were found for ERT after one year and HRT after three and four years. Smaller trials mostly reported no benefits on individual cognitive areas. There is strong evidence that ERT and HRT do not prevent cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women for short or long-term therapy (up to five years). It is unclear if specific types of ERT or HRT have different effects on certain groups
We analyzed two studies with 880 participants and one ongoing trial. The studies focused on people with COPD and lasted 12 weeks. They compared the effects of two inhaled treatments: ICS/LABA (fluticasone and vilanterol) and LAMA (tiotropium). The results showed very low-quality evidence for differences in mortality, COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and serious adverse events. No significant differences were found for secondary outcomes like symptom improvement, hospital admissions, and medication use. The studies did not provide enough data for other endpoints like intubation and physical activity. We cannot confidently conclude if one treatment
This text says that five studies were reviewed, and data from four of them (with 169 participants) were analyzed. One study showed that medication was better than a placebo for treating symptoms. Both medication and therapy helped reduce symptom severity in other studies. One therapy study showed a low relapse rate. The results suggest that certain medications and therapy may help treat patients with BDD, but more research is needed, including studies on adolescents and different treatment methods.
Three studies with 268 adults looked at cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. The results showed that using a desensitization protocol was better than a rechallenge protocol for preventing cotrimoxazole discontinuation and reducing overall hypersensitivity. No severe reactions occurred in either protocol. In these small trials, cotrimoxazole desensitization led to fewer treatment discontinuations and adverse reactions in HIV-infected patients with a history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole. More research is needed, especially for children and in resource-poor settings, as well as for treating opportunistic infections and different desensitization-d
We reviewed three trials with 148 neonates and found no new trials. Each study showed higher sedation levels in the midazolam group compared to the placebo group, but the sedation scales used haven't been validated for preterm infants. The midazolam group had a longer NICU stay, and one study reported lower pain scores during midazolam infusion. Another study found a higher risk of adverse neurological events in the midazolam group. The trials were of moderate quality, and there isn't enough data to support using midazolam as a sedative for neonates in intensive care. This review
This text discusses a study with 12 trials and 767 participants. The results show no significant differences between antibiotics and placebo/no treatment for diarrhea, fever, or illness duration. However, antibiotics led to more negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week and increased the chance of passing the same Salmonella serovar one month later. Antibiotics also caused more non-severe side effects. Overall, there is no clear benefit of using antibiotics for NTS diarrhea in healthy individuals, and the effects on very young, very old, or severely ill people are uncertain.
We analyzed 23 studies (n = 4192) on the accuracy of IL-6 for diagnosing sepsis in critically ill adults. The participants varied in age, gender, diagnosis, setting, country, and other factors. Sepsis prevalence ranged from 12% to 78% across studies. All studies had a high risk of bias, and there was significant heterogeneity in the data. We found a sensitivity of 66% (95% confidence interval 60 to 72) for IL-6 in diagnosing sepsis. Testing 1000 adult patients with IL-6 would result in 330
This text discusses a review of 29 trials (5718 participants) that studied the effectiveness of different wound dressings on surgical wounds. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias and were small with low numbers of surgical site infection (SSI) events. The trials included various surgical procedures with different contamination classifications. Four trials compared wound dressings with no dressing, while 25 studies compared different dressing types. The review found 11 comparisons in total. The primary outcome was SSI, and the certainty of evidence was very low for most comparisons due to risk of bias and imprecision. Secondary outcomes included scarring, dressing acceptability, and
Two trials were conducted to study the effects of selenium, DHA, and EPA on postnatal depression. The first trial compared selenium yeast tablets with a placebo and found no significant effect on depression scores. The second trial compared DHA and EPA with a placebo and also found no benefit in preventing postpartum depression. There was no difference in the effect on postnatal depression when comparing EPA with DHA. Secondary outcomes also showed no significant effects. Overall, there is not enough evidence to conclude that selenium, DHA, or EPA can prevent postnatal depression, and no other dietary supplements are currently recommended for prevention.
We found 11 studies: 7 looked at different infusion times (803 people), and 4 looked at different peak doses (5280 people). Seven studies were RCTs studying various anthracycline infusion times, with long-term data for one trial. The analysis showed a significantly lower rate of heart failure with infusions lasting six hours or more compared to shorter ones (risk ratio 0.27; 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.81; 5 studies; 557 people). Most participants were adults with various solid tumors. For different anthracycline peak doses, we found two R
We analyzed 37 trials with 3110 participants, including nine new studies since 2009 and five previously excluded ones. We found two ongoing studies and two awaiting classification. The studies involved adults and children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and started treatment upon hospital admission or after surgery, lasting at least 24 hours. Data on mortality, unfavorable outcomes, and pneumonia were reported, but inconsistencies prevented a meta-analysis. Poor reporting and heterogeneity made it difficult to assess risk of bias. Using the GRADE approach, we downgraded the evidence quality for each outcome. There is still no high-quality evidence that hypothermia benefits T
Six studies with 519 depressed individuals were analyzed, but the studies varied greatly in methods, participants, and measurements. Although some studies showed positive results, there is limited or conflicting evidence for family therapy's effectiveness in treating depression, except for moderate evidence from three studies suggesting it's better than no treatment or waiting. The current research is too varied and limited to determine the overall effectiveness of family therapy for depression. It's recommended to use other proven psychological treatments instead. More high-quality trials are needed to examine the effectiveness of specific family therapy methods.
This text discusses three trials with 206 participants who have vascular dementia. The studies had a high risk of bias, but showed a positive effect of Duxil on cognitive function. There was no data on behavior, death, or functional performance. Adverse events were not significantly different across trials. The trials did not cover behavior disturbance, quality of life, or caregiver burden. Due to low quality and potential bias, there isn't enough evidence to support using Duxil for dementia treatment. More high-quality, large-scale trials are needed.
Seven studies with 960 participants were found. The trial quality was generally low, with potential bias and no blinding. High statistical variation between studies reduced evidence reliability. Results showed that using drains reduced seroma formation and the number of post-surgery seroma aspirations. However, it also increased hospital stay length. No significant differences were found in infection rates, seroma aspiration volume, lymphoedema, or haematoma incidence. Limited evidence suggests drains may help reduce seroma formation and aspirations, but this benefit should be weighed against longer hospital stays.
Eight studies with 390,769 participants were analyzed. Five were prospective cohort studies, two were case-control studies, and one was a randomized controlled trial. The methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The results regarding flavonoids, colorectal cancer, and adenomas were inconsistent. There was no clear evidence that flavonoid intake reduced the risk of colorectal neoplasms. The findings for different types of flavonoids were conflicting. However, two studies suggested that increased intake of Flavan-3-ols might reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas. There was medium quality evidence supporting
We analyzed seven trials with 1,369 participants, all with a high risk of bias. Five trials used the first definition of slow responders, while three others used the second definition. None of the trials mentioned our main outcomes. However, for secondary outcomes, extending treatment to 72 weeks increased the sustained virological response based on both definitions. The end of treatment response was not significantly different between the two groups. The number of participants who relapsed was lower in the 72-week treatment groups. Treatment length did not significantly affect adherence. In the one trial reporting adverse events, there was no significant difference between the groups. This review
This text discusses a review of two studies (34 participants) that examined the accuracy of EUS in determining the resectability of pancreatic cancers. The studies had low concerns about applicability and varied risk of bias. The average probability of unresectable disease after a CT scan was 60.5%. EUS had a sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.80 for unresectability. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.3 and 0.2, respectively. With a 60.5% pre-test probability, the post-test probability of unresectable disease was 86.9%
This review included 34 studies with 2169 participants suffering from blepharitis. Due to differences in study characteristics, meta-analyses were limited. Topical antibiotics and lid hygiene provided some relief for anterior blepharitis, but the effectiveness of other treatments was inconclusive. There is no strong evidence supporting any treatment for chronic blepharitis, and more research is needed. Future studies should separate participants by condition type and compare medical interventions and commercial products to conventional lid hygiene measures. Outcomes should be patient-centered and measured using validated tools. Long-term follow-up, at least one year, is important to assess chronic outcomes
One trial with 23 participants was included, but it had a high risk of bias. Only one secondary outcome was measured, and no significant difference was found between groups. Adverse effects were reported, including airway swelling. There isn't enough high-quality evidence to determine if photodynamic therapy is beneficial for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. More research with larger samples and long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate its effectiveness, including measuring symptom improvement and quality of life.
We found 42 studies with 4220 participants. Twenty studies gave accuracy data based on individual participants, and 16 of these evaluated the accuracy of CDUS. These studies were generally of moderate to low quality. Eleven studies evaluated the accuracy of CE-CDUS, which were of better quality than the CDUS studies. The summary estimates for CDUS and CE-CDUS showed that CE-CDUS was superior to CDUS in terms of sensitivity. Seven studies provided estimates before and after using contrast, showing a significant improvement in sensitivity with contrast use. Regression testing showed evidence of statistically significant effect bias related to the year of publication and
We analyzed seven studies with 766 participants, focusing on low back pain during labor. The studies had good methodology but some had a high risk of bias. They found that sterile water reduced pain more than other treatments, but a meta-analysis was not suitable due to different scales and lack of normal distribution. No study reported primary efficacy outcomes or women's satisfaction with pain relief. There was no significant difference between sterile water and saline for delivery outcomes or Apgar scores. Some women preferred sterile water for future pain relief. No adverse events were reported except temporary injection pain. The limited outcomes make it difficult to draw conclusions for clinical practice. More rigorous
This review included 12 trials with 1932 participants. It found that using glue for mesh fixation in hernia repair reduced postoperative chronic pain by 37% compared to sutures. However, the reduction in pain was less significant when using lightweight mesh. Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups. Glue fixation was better than sutures in terms of operation duration, hematoma, and recovery time to daily activities. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups. The quality of the evidence was moderate to low. In conclusion, glue may be a good alternative to sutures for mesh fixation in hernia repair
We found 32 technical editing studies and 66 reference accuracy surveys. Only three were randomised controlled trials. A set of unspecified editorial processes improved readability and reporting quality in some studies, while stricter policies showed mixed results. More intensive editing reduced errors in abstracts and references. Providing author instructions improved ethics reporting and reduced reference errors, but didn't affect abstract quality in one trial. Structuring improved abstract quality but increased length. Reference accuracy studies revealed a 38% citation error rate and a 20% quotation error rate. Few studies rigorously evaluated technical editing, but some evidence suggests it improves biomedical papers. Many references in biomedical articles have
We analyzed 15 studies with 721 adult cancer pain patients from various malignancies. The studies had decent quality but high risk of bias due to small size and other issues. Most studies used codeine alone or with paracetamol, and compared it to placebo or other drugs. Results showed codeine was better than placebo for pain relief but caused side effects like nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Study limitations included small size, short duration, and poor reporting. There's still uncertainty about codeine's long-term safety and effectiveness, and no data for children.
This text discusses a review of 12 trials involving 563 people with sickle cell disease, aged 6-35 years old, mostly African-American. The trials varied in length, methods, and assessments. The overall risk of bias was mixed. The review found that educational programs improved patient knowledge and reduced depression. However, the effect on caregiver knowledge was not sustained. No significant effects were found on coping, family relationships, or health-related quality of life. The quality of evidence was low to moderate, suggesting further research may change the estimates. The review highlights the positive effects of educational interventions on patient knowledge and depression, but the clinical benefit
The review analyzed six trials with 2411 participants, mostly with focal onset seizures and aged 16-80 years. Two studies had low risk of bias, while four had unclear risk. Brivaracetam add-on treatment significantly reduced seizure frequency and increased seizure freedom compared to placebo. However, there was no significant difference in treatment withdrawal or adverse events, except for a higher withdrawal rate due to adverse events with brivaracetam. These findings mainly apply to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Future research should focus on longer-term effects, other seizure types, and other age groups.
We looked at 38 studies, mostly from wealthy countries, about mothers' views on vaccine communication. Many focused on the MMR vaccine. Parents wanted more information than they received (high confidence). Lack of information caused worry and regret for some (moderate confidence). Parents wanted clear, simple, and balanced information about vaccines (high confidence), tailored to their situation (low confidence). They wanted information available in more places and before appointments (moderate confidence). Health workers were important sources of information (high confidence), but poor communication affected vaccination decisions (moderate confidence). Parents found it hard to trust information sources (high confidence). Hesitant
We found 10 trials with 599 anorexia nervosa participants for the review. Seven were from previous versions, and three are new. One ongoing trial was deemed ineligible, and six new ongoing trials were added. Two trials included children. The trials tested various psychological therapies with poor comparability and risks of bias. Results suggest that non-specialist treatment may be less effective than focal psychodynamic therapy. However, no differences were found between cognitive analytic therapy and treatment as usual (TAU), nor for body mass index (BMI). Dropout rates were similar between individual therapies and TAU. Two trials found that specialist therapy or optimized TAU
The review involved 516 participants from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One study had two trials in the USA, comparing silicone oil to sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas and perfluropropane (C3F8) gas. The third trial was international, comparing heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil. Results showed similar outcomes for retinal detachment (RD) patients treated with silicone oil, perfluropropane gas, or sulfur hexafluoride gas. No significant differences were found in visual acuity or macular attachment between silicone oil and perfluoropropane gas. However, silicone
This review included five studies with 1819 women. It found that planned early delivery for women with hypertensive disorders after 34 weeks of pregnancy reduced maternal risks and had no clear difference in infant risks. However, more research is needed to understand the best timing for delivery and the effects on different types of hypertensive diseases.
Six studies with 142 participants were included. Two studies compared regular treatment to on-demand treatment for children with hemophilia. Results favored regular treatment for reducing bleeding. Other studies evaluated different types of hemophilia and treatment schedules, with mixed results. Some complications were observed in patients on regular treatment. Strong evidence supports regular treatment for preserving joint function in children with hemophilia, but more research is needed to determine the best treatment plan and effectiveness in adults.
In this update, we added one new study. A total of 13 trials with 1824 participants met the review's criteria, but only 10 trials (732 participants) had usable data. Many trials had poor reporting, making it difficult to assess their quality. Due to differences in interventions, we couldn't combine data for any outcomes. Eight studies aimed for remission, but survival rates didn't significantly differ between treatment groups. Five studies aimed to maintain remission, with two out of three reporting substantial survival, but no significant difference between groups. Less aggressive treatments seem to have similar effects with fewer side effects. Recent studies prefer less
Two studies with 447 RhD negative women examined IM and IV anti-D prophylaxis methods. Both groups received a 1500 IU dose of Rhophylac at 28 weeks of pregnancy. No RhD alloimmunization occurred, and anti-D IgG concentrations were similar after 2-3 weeks. Neither group developed RhD antibodies, suggesting both methods are effective. However, limited studies and small sample sizes make it difficult to determine any differences. Anti-D can be given through IM or IV injections, depending on factors like preparation, dosage, and patient preference. More research is needed to provide better guidance.
Eight studies involving 21,379 diabetic patients were analyzed. Three studies compared ticlopidine to aspirin or placebo, while five compared clopidogrel to aspirin or other combinations. Most trials had low bias risk and included patients with previous cardiovascular disease (CVD). The follow-up duration ranged from 365 to 913 days. Only one trial provided data on all-cause mortality, vascular mortality, and heart attacks, showing no significant differences. Stroke data was available in three trials, but no significant reduction was found. No data was available on peripheral vascular disease, quality of life, diabetes-specific adverse events, or costs.
Ten trials with 191 participants met the inclusion criteria. Seven trials studied single treatment sessions, while others evaluated two-week, six-week, and three-month interventions. Blinding was only possible for airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support trials. Most trials had unclear risk of bias due to inadequate descriptions. The six-week trial had the lowest risk of bias. Six trials compared non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance with alternative chest physiotherapy methods. Results showed that airway clearance may be easier with non-invasive ventilation, and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it. No evidence was found that non-invasive ventilation increases sput
This updated review on nighttime-NIPPV in COPD added three new studies, totaling seven studies with 245 people. We got individual data for all participants in all studies. The 95% confidence interval for all outcomes included zero, such as blood CO2 and O2 levels, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, lung function, and sleep efficiency. The average effect on walking distance was small (27.7 m) and not significant. The true effect of NIPPV on walking distance is uncertain, and we can't rule out a meaningful effect. Nighttime-NIPPV for at least three months in stable COP
We analyzed four trials with 1190 women to study the effects of inducing labor for suspected large babies. Blinding was not possible, but the studies had low or unclear risk of bias. Inducing labor did not significantly change the risk of caesarean section or instrumental delivery. However, it reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia and fractures. There were no clear differences in brachial plexus injury or neonatal asphyxia. The average birth weight was lower in the induced labor group, but there was a lot of variation between studies. One study found an increase in severe perineal tears in the induced labor
We analyzed 159 clinical trials on vitamin D, with 56 trials providing usable data on mortality. Most participants were women over 70 years old. The trials were conducted in high-income countries, and more than half had a low risk of bias. Vitamin D3 was found to decrease mortality and cancer mortality, while vitamin D2, alfacalcidol, and calcitriol did not significantly affect mortality. Vitamin D3 combined with calcium increased the risk of kidney stones, and alfacalcidol and calcitriol increased the risk of high calcium levels in the blood. Due to some limitations in the study, further
This text says that there were enough studies to analyze the effects of fluoxetine, orlistat, and sibutramine on weight loss. The review included 22 trials with a total of 296 participants for fluoxetine, 2036 for orlistat, and 1047 for sibutramine. These drugs led to small weight reductions and slightly lower glycated hemoglobin levels. However, they also caused side effects like gastrointestinal issues, tremors, and palpitations. Some other drugs showed weight loss effects in a few studies, but there was not enough data for many other drugs. Fluoxetine, orlist
Five studies with 734 participants were examined. One study was of good quality, while the other four were poor. A meta-analysis was difficult due to differing reported outcomes. No significant differences were found between VGB and CBZ for treatment withdrawal and six-month remission, but VGB had a disadvantage for time to first seizure. VGB had more weight gain but fewer skin rashes and drowsiness compared to CBZ. No differences in visual issues were noted. Current data is insufficient to determine the risk-benefit balance of VGB vs CBZ for epilepsy. Due to potential visual field defects, VGB should be prescribed cautiously and
We found four RCTs that met our criteria, but two ended early and didn't report results. The other two trials studied 600 participants with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both trials had an experimental group receiving G-CSF plus plerixafor and a control group receiving G-CSF plus placebo. The analysis showed no significant differences in 12-month mortality or adverse events during stem cell mobilization and collection. However, the plerixafor group had better stem cell collection results. There was high variation between studies for the number of transplanted participants, so we didn't analyze that data
This text discusses 23 trials with 1806 women, where 717 used cones for incontinence treatment. The trials were small and varied in quality. Results were hard to combine due to different outcome measures and high drop-out rates. Cones were more effective than no treatment, but there was little difference between cones and other treatments like PFMT and electrostimulation. There wasn't enough evidence to compare cones plus PFMT to either treatment alone. Only seven trials used quality of life measures, and none looked at economic outcomes. The review suggests that cones may be as effective as PFMT and electrostimulation for incontinence,
This text discusses a review of 11 trials involving 2246 AF patients. The studies looked at education, decision aids, and self-monitoring plus education interventions. The results were uncertain for self-monitoring plus education on TTR, but there were small positive effects of education on anxiety and depression. Decision aids had a slightly negative effect on decision conflict. Overall, there is not enough evidence to make clear conclusions about the impact of these interventions on TTR in AF patients receiving OAT. More research is needed to understand the effects of these interventions and the psychological implications for patients with this chronic condition.
This text includes 70 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 11,487 women, and 7 new RCTs with 778 women. The new trials study various aspects of PGE2 and PGF2a treatments. Most trials have unclear risk of bias. Vaginal prostaglandin E2 likely reduces the time to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours but increases the risk of uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes. It may also reduce the caesarean section rate by about 10%. The overall effect on maternal and fetal outcomes is uncertain. PGE2 tablets, gels
Eleven studies were found, and five with 247 infants were included in this review. Comparing cot-nursing to incubator care, there was no significant difference in body temperature or weight gain. However, cot-nursing had more cases of hyperthermia. Fewer infants were breastfed and fewer died before leaving the hospital in the cot-nursing group, but these results were not statistically significant. Cot-nursing with a heated water-filled mattress had similar effects to incubator care. More research is needed, especially in developing countries. Limited data on cot-nursing in a heated room makes it not recommended for
This text discusses three studies with 146 participants that compare two techniques for exposing PDCs. The main finding is that both techniques may be equally successful, but the evidence is of low quality. One study reported complications after surgery, but individual studies did not find differences between the techniques. The current evidence does not show that one technique is better than the other, but more high-quality studies are needed. Three ongoing clinical trials may provide more information in the future.
We analyzed three trials with 244 women, which had a high risk of bias. Two types of prostaglandins were used: sulprostone (50 participants) and misoprostol (194 participants). The prostaglandins were not better than a placebo in reducing manual removal of the placenta, severe bleeding, blood transfusion, blood loss, or time for placental removal. Side effects were similar, except for more shivering in the prostaglandin group. No data on maternal mortality or additional uterotonic use was found. Current evidence on prostaglandin effectiveness and safety for retained placenta is limited
This text discusses six studies with 355 infants that used different types of continuous distending pressure (CDP) treatments. No new trials were added in this update. CDP is linked to a lower risk of treatment failure, overall mortality, and mortality in infants weighing over 1500 grams. However, it also increases the risk of pneumothorax. There was no difference found in bronchopulmonary dysplasia or long-term outcomes. In summary, CDP treatments like CPAP and CNP can reduce respiratory failure and mortality in preterm infants with respiratory distress but may increase the risk of pneumothorax. Most
This review included six studies with 157 participants. The analysis showed that foam dressings don't improve diabetic foot ulcer healing compared to basic wound dressings. There was also no significant difference in healing when comparing foam and alginate dressings or foam and hydrocolloid dressings. The studies were small and had limited follow-up times. Currently, there's no evidence that foam dressings are more effective for healing diabetic foot ulcers than other dressings. Decision makers should consider factors like dressing cost and wound management properties, such as exudate management.
We found three trials. Two trials with 111 participants compared endoscopic and surgical interventions. The surgical group had more pain relief and better quality of life in the middle/long-term (2-5 years), but not in the long-term (≥ 5 years). There were no major differences in complications or mortality. One trial with 32 participants compared surgical intervention to conservative treatment. Surgery provided more pain relief and better pancreatic function, but the trial had limitations and a small number of participants. Overall, surgery is better for pain relief in obstructive chronic pancreatitis, but more trials are needed to confirm these results due to limitations and
This review includes one trial with 857 patients who had minor skin surgery. They were divided into two groups: early bathing (415 patients) and delayed bathing (442 patients). The main focus was on surgical site infections (SSIs). No significant difference in SSIs was found between the groups (8.5% early, 8.8% delayed). Current evidence from this trial is not enough to determine the benefits or risks of early versus delayed bathing after surgery. More trials are needed to make a clear conclusion.
A non-blinded study compared prednisone to no treatment in 35 participants but didn't measure the main outcome for this review. The trial had a high risk of bias, and the evidence quality was very low. Another double-blind study compared daily prednisolone to monthly dexamethasone in 40 participants but didn't report the outcomes for this review. The trial had a low risk of bias, but the evidence quality was limited. There was little difference in remission, disability, or impairment after one year. Grip strength and MRC scores showed little difference between groups. Side effects were similar, except sleeplessness and
Six studies with 2100 participants were analyzed. The studies focused on people with asthma taking regular medications and excluded those with severe asthma or COPD. One study compared two types of check-ups for oral steroid tapering in severe asthma. The studies were not blinded, and dropout rates were high in four of the six studies, which may have affected the results. It is unclear if remote check-ups led to more people needing oral corticosteroids for asthma exacerbations compared to face-to-face check-ups due to wide confidence intervals. In face-to-face check-up groups, 21 out of 1000 participants had exacerbations requiring oral steroids
Out of 16 studies, three met the criteria and included 212 participants. These studies met at least seven out of 10 methodological requirements. The results showed that exercise therapy had positive effects on functional ability, quality of life, and aerobic capacity, but none were statistically significant. No negative effects were reported from exercise therapy. However, there is no strong evidence that exercise therapy can improve these aspects for patients with JIA. The limited number of studies affects the generalizability of the results. No short-term harmful effects were found in any study, and exercise does not worsen arthritis. There is a need for standardized measurements in health
This study analyzed 19 trials with 2663 participants to examine the effects of antibiotics on patients with varying severity of illness. The results showed that antibiotics had some benefits for outpatients with mild to moderate symptoms and ICU patients, but the effects were small and inconsistent for inpatients with severe symptoms. There was no significant impact on mortality, length of hospital stay, or adverse events. The study suggests that more research is needed to identify which patients would benefit from antibiotics and to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics, which can lead to side effects, costs, and multi-resistance.
We analyzed nine RCTs with 1414 participants aged 24-70, comparing whole grain diets to lower whole grain or refined grain control groups. No studies reported the effect of whole grain diets on cardiovascular mortality or events. All studies focused on risk factors like blood lipids and blood pressure. These studies had unclear or high risk of bias, and none lasted longer than 16 weeks. We found no significant difference in total cholesterol between whole grain and control groups. The overall quality of evidence was low. Four studies were independently funded, while others had commercial interests in cereals. There isn't enough evidence from RCTs to show
This text discusses 38 studies with 1,896 participants on rehabilitation interventions for ankle fractures. Only one study had a low risk of bias, while many had high risks of selection and reporting bias. Limited evidence showed short-term benefits of using an air-stirrup over other methods and no improvement from hypnosis. Most studies focused on interventions after surgical fixation, with removable immobilization and controlled exercise showing reduced activity limitation, pain, and improved ankle motion. However, this also led to more minor adverse events. Early weight-bearing after surgery showed small improvements in ankle motion. There was little evidence on the best type of support or immobilization,
Four studies met the requirements. Each study evaluated a different intervention. Two studies were in low-income countries, and two were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A home-based nursing program RCT showed improved knowledge and medication refills but no effect on CD4 count and viral load. Another RCT with caregiver medication diaries had fewer missed doses in the intervention group, but the difference was not significant, and there was no effect on CD4 percentage or viral load. A non-randomized trial of peer support group therapy for adolescents showed no change in adherence but increased viral load suppression. Another non-randomized trial found no difference in adherence between two
Five studies with 696 participants were included, where they received various doses of fenoprofen, zomepirac, morphine, codeine, or a placebo for pain relief after different surgeries. The most effective dose was fenoprofen 200 mg, which provided at least 50% pain relief for 4-6 hours. There wasn't enough data to analyze other doses or compare them to other medications. No serious side effects or withdrawals were reported. Fenoprofen 200 mg is effective for moderate to severe postoperative pain, but more information is needed to assess other doses and outcomes.
This text discusses six trials related to pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for prolapse treatment. Three of these trials are new, and four of them are small with less than 25 women per group. Two trials had a moderate to high risk of bias. The trials compared PFMT as a treatment for prolapse against a control group and as an addition to surgery versus surgery alone. Results showed that PFMT improved prolapse symptoms and severity compared to the control group. However, there were some inconsistencies in the findings related to pelvic floor muscle function and urinary outcomes. The largest and most rigorous trial suggested that six months of supervised PFMT
This text discusses a study of 14 trials with 1,724 participants, examining the effectiveness of various treatments for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The study found that topical quinolone antibiotics were more effective at clearing discharge than no treatment or antiseptics. However, the results were less clear for non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to no treatment or antiseptics. The study also found no significant difference between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics. The evidence regarding safety was weak, and further trials are needed to clarify the effects of non-quinol
We analyzed 21 studies with 6253 participants, conducted between 1974 and 2011. Most studies had unclear methods and high applicability concerns. In these studies, First Rank Symptoms (FRS) differentiated schizophrenia from other diagnoses with varying sensitivity and specificity. Overall, FRS correctly identified schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time. However, using FRS in triage may lead to incorrect diagnoses and delays in treatment for some people. Despite its limitations, FRS is a simple, quick, and useful clinical indicator for schizophrenia. Newer tests may show better results, but FRS can still be helpful when
We analyzed 10 RCTs, with 5 being new, involving 2003 participants in educational interventions and 44 in a psychological study. All interventions were additional to conventional therapy in primary and secondary care settings. Some studies had methodological weaknesses, such as high risk of bias. Our main outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity, and improvement in sleep and quality of life. No study reported global assessment or sleep improvement. The largest and most robust study (n=992) showed significant reduction in disease severity and improved quality of life in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention groups. It provided six standardized,
This review included 14 trials with 753 participants and found moderate quality evidence that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can improve outcomes for certain conditions related to late radiation tissue injury (LRTI). HBOT was found to be more effective in achieving mucosal coverage with osteoradionecrosis (ORN), improving wound healing, and treating radiation proctitis. It also showed benefits in healing tooth sockets after dental extraction in irradiated areas. However, there was no evidence of benefits for established radiation injury to neural tissue, and more research is needed to determine the best patient selection and timing for treatment.
We found 10 studies with 2961 surgeons comparing blunt and sharp needles in various surgeries. Blunt needles reduced glove perforations and needle stick injuries. Though blunt needles require more force and can be harder to use, they are still acceptable. High-quality evidence shows that blunt needles significantly lower the risk of exposure to blood and bodily fluids. Future research is unlikely to change this conclusion.
This text discusses a review of seven trials with 422 participants comparing trifluoperazine to low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The studies varied in size and length, and their methods were not well reported. The results showed no significant difference in treatment response, acceptability, or adverse effects between the two drugs. However, trifluoperazine caused more movement disorders. The quality of the studies and evidence was low, so more research is needed to draw conclusions about the relative effects of the two drugs.
We found nine studies with 593 infants comparing responsive and scheduled feeding in preterm infants transitioning from tube to oral feeding. The studies had some weaknesses and limited data quality. Results suggest that responsive feeding may lead to slightly slower weight gain and faster transition to oral feeding, but the evidence is of low quality. The impact of this finding is unclear, as there was no strong effect on hospital stay duration. No parent or caregiver opinions were reported. Overall, there is no strong evidence that responsive feeding affects important outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Some low-quality evidence suggests that responsive feeding may help infants reach full oral feeding sooner. However,
This review included two studies with 161 participants in total. The studies didn't report on death or limb loss rates. One study with 133 participants found significant improvement in ankle brachial index (ABI) for those who took folic acid or 5-MTHF compared to a placebo. The second study with 18 participants found no difference in ABI for those who took a multivitamin B supplement compared to a placebo. No major events were reported. Currently, there's no recommendation for treating high homocysteine levels in peripheral arterial disease, and more well-designed trials are needed.
Two cluster-RCTs from 503 dental practices, 821 dentists, and 4771 patients met the selection criteria. Both studies had a high risk of bias, and the overall evidence quality was low/very low for all outcomes, according to the GRADE approach. One study examined the effect of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on fissure sealant placement in permanent molar teeth. The study found a significant increase in clinical activity with fee-for-service payment but was limited to four deprived areas in Scotland, affecting its applicability. The study didn't report health service utilization or patient outcomes data. The second study, conducted
We analyzed 21 studies with over 17,000 women and their babies. Zinc supplements slightly reduced preterm births but did not affect low birthweight babies. There were no significant differences in other outcomes between zinc and non-zinc groups. The evidence quality was moderate for preterm birth and low birthweight, and low for stillbirth or neonatal death. Zinc supplements mainly helped low-income women in areas with high perinatal mortality. There is no strong evidence that zinc supplements provide other benefits during pregnancy. Improving overall nutrition in impoverished areas should be a priority instead of focusing on specific supplements like zinc.
Ten studies with 1656 participants were included in our analysis, and none were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. All studies used probiotics alongside antifungal drugs. Probiotics improved short-term clinical and mycological cure rates and reduced relapse rates at one month. However, these effects did not lead to better long-term clinical or mycological cure rates. Probiotics did not increase the frequency of serious side effects. No eligible studies were found for other outcomes like time to first relapse, need for additional treatment, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, low-quality evidence suggests that probiotics as an additional therapy
This updated review includes seven trials with 696 participants from various countries and economic backgrounds. The trials studied the effects of progestogens on miscarriage, preterm birth, and congenital abnormalities. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that progestogens may reduce the risk of miscarriage, but have little or no effect on preterm birth rates. The evidence on congenital abnormalities is uncertain due to very low-quality evidence from only two small trials.
We found 83 trials on laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy, but only five were eligible for our review. These studies included 4786 people (9503 eyes) from the USA, UK, and Japan. Most participants had proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Four studies used panretinal photocoagulation with argon laser, and one used selective photocoagulation of non-perfusion areas. Three studies compared laser treatment to no treatment, and two compared it to deferred treatment. At 12 months, there was little difference in visual acuity loss between laser-treated eyes and those with no or deferred treatment
This text discusses two trials with 269 participants, mostly men around 65 years old. The trials took place in China and Italy and involved adults with breathing issues after upper abdominal surgery. Both trials had a high risk of bias. The results suggest that CPAP or bilevel NPPV might help reduce the need for tracheal intubation and shorten ICU stays, but there was no difference in mortality or hospital stay length. The evidence for these findings was of low or very low quality. More high-quality studies are needed to confirm these results.
This text discusses four trials with 388 women that had unclear to high risk of bias. Various pain relief agents and methods were tested, but results couldn't be combined. Three trials compared diazepam to other agents for general anesthesia, and one trial compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block. For primary outcomes, one trial found diazepam more effective than vinydan-ether, while another trial found no significant difference between diazepam and ketamine. Spinal analgesia was more effective and caused less severe pain than pudendal nerve block. No trials reported serious maternal or neonatal complications. For secondary
We analyzed 15 studies with 1048 participants, mostly from India, Europe, and the US. These participants were adults with mild to moderate asthma. The studies examined yoga interventions, including breathing, posture, and meditation, lasting from two weeks to 54 months. The risk of bias was low in one study and unclear or high in the others. Some evidence suggests that yoga may improve quality of life, symptoms, and reduce medication usage for people with asthma. However, the effects on lung function were not significant. Two studies showed improved asthma control, but the data was not combined due to high variability. No serious side effects were reported
The review looked at 10 trials with 249 participants who received various treatments. Seven trials tested single treatments, and three tested combined treatments. Many studies didn't provide enough data for the main outcome, which was the change in muscle strength after six months. Two trials of interferon beta-1a showed no significant difference in muscle strength compared to a placebo. One trial of methotrexate (MTX) showed it didn't slow down disease progression. None of the published trials were powerful enough to detect a treatment effect, and most provided very low-quality evidence. Three trials compared intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to
In this first update, no new trials were found. Nine RCTs with 3,144 participants were included. Linezolid showed better clinical and microbiological cure rates in adults, especially for MRSA infections, compared to vancomycin. No significant difference in mortality was found between the two drugs. Linezolid had fewer side effects like red man syndrome, itching, and rash, but more cases of low platelet count and nausea. Hospital stays were shorter and outpatient costs lower for linezolid, making it more cost-effective overall. Linezolid appears more effective for skin infections, including those caused by MRSA. However
We analyzed eight studies with 512 participants and found a wide variety in methods and outcomes. There were no significant differences in postoperative death, overall survival, and complications, except for delayed stomach emptying, which was better in the CW group. The PPW group had shorter operation times, less blood loss, and fewer blood transfusions. However, the evidence quality was low. There were no major differences in death, complications, and survival between the two surgeries, but some measures favored the PPW procedure. More high-quality studies with clear outcomes are needed.
This text discusses six studies with 1862 participants that looked at the effects of calcium channel blockers on death risk in head injury patients. The results were mixed, with some studies showing a possible benefit, especially for a specific type of brain injury. However, there is still uncertainty about the overall effects, and some patients may experience harmful side effects.
We analyzed four RCTs with 3090 participants in total. Three trials had low risk of bias, and one had high risk. Comparing survival rates, 11.88% in the CPR plus delayed defibrillation group and 11.54% in the immediate defibrillation group survived to hospital discharge (low-quality evidence). We couldn't determine the better treatment for neurological outcomes, return of spontaneous circulation, or one-year survival. No adverse effects were linked to either treatment. Due to low-quality evidence, we can't conclude if immediate defibrillation or initial CPR before defibrillation is better for patient outcomes. More
The new search found 15 trials, with 3 eligible for inclusion and 10 trials included from 8 comparison groups. Only one trial reported live birth rates. The conventional GnRHa long protocol had fewer oocytes retrieved and a higher total dose of gonadotrophins used compared to the stop protocol and GnRH antagonist protocol. Cancellation rates were higher in the GnRHa flare-up group compared to the long protocol group. No studies reported differences in miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates. There isn't enough evidence to support a specific intervention for poor responders in IVF. More high-quality RCTs with relevant outcomes are
This updated review includes 53 randomized controlled trials on family intervention for schizophrenia. It may reduce relapse frequency, hospital admissions, and improve medication compliance, but doesn't clearly affect people leaving care. It also seems to improve social functioning and family emotions. No data was found on its effect on suicide prevention. Family intervention could be beneficial for patients, clinicians, and policy makers, but the study quality may overestimate the effects. More trials with better methodology are needed for greater confidence in the findings.
This text discusses three trials with 263 participants that studied the treatment of in-stent restenosis in leg arteries using drug-eluting balloons. The trials took place in Germany and Austria and were mostly sponsored by the industry. The balloons were made by two companies and used paclitaxel as the drug. The trials looked at various outcomes, but the certainty of the evidence was very low. Most participants were followed for 12 months, but one trial went up to 24 months. Results showed no difference in amputation rates, but drug-eluting balloons had better outcomes for target lesion revascularization and binary restenosis.
This analysis included seven trials with 922 participants. The study found that corticosteroids reduced the risk of coronary artery abnormalities and had no serious side effects or deaths. They also shortened fever duration, improved lab results, and reduced hospital stays. However, more research is needed to determine which groups benefit the most from this treatment. The evidence quality was high for some outcomes and moderate for others. Overall, the study suggests that using steroids in the early stages of Kawasaki Disease can improve health outcomes, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.
This text discusses a study that included eight smaller studies with 846 participants. The focus was on Parent-Infant Psychotherapy (PIP) and its effects on parental depression and infant attachment. The results showed some improvements in infant attachment when using PIP, but no significant differences in parental depression or other outcomes compared to control groups or alternative treatments. The quality of the evidence was rated as low or very low, and more research is needed to better understand the impact of PIP on factors like parental mental health and parent-infant interaction.
In this updated review, we found 11 trials with 753 participants. The evidence showed no significant differences in Apgar scores at one and five minutes. None of the trials reported maternal desaturation. Low-quality evidence showed that women receiving extra oxygen during labor had higher oxygen levels in their blood and their baby's blood. However, there was high variation in these results. A subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in low-risk studies, but a benefit for the neonatal oxygen group in high-risk studies. Overall, there is no clear evidence that giving extra oxygen to healthy pregnant women during elective caesarean section is beneficial or harmful
This text discusses a review of 12 studies with 2196 participants, focusing on the effects of reminder packaging on medication adherence. The results show that reminder packaging increased the percentage of pills taken by 11% on average, but there was significant variation among the trials. There was no significant change in the proportion of self-reported adherent patients. Reminder packaging was found to decrease diastolic blood pressure and reduce glycated hemoglobin levels, but no effect was seen on systolic blood pressure. There was not enough data for other clinical outcomes, such as vitamin levels and psychological symptoms. One study found that reminder packaging was preferred by patients with
We found 15 trials testing 11 different drugs for liver surgery. All trials had a high risk of bias. No significant differences were found in death, liver failure, or surgery complications. The trimetazidine group had a shorter hospital stay. Some drugs improved liver function and reduced liver injury, but the results are uncertain due to few trials, small sample sizes, and bias. These drugs need more well-designed trials before being used in clinical practice.
We reviewed 61 studies on kidney problems in cancer survivors. These studies included 13,327 participants, and the rate of kidney issues varied from 0% to 84%. This variation could be due to differences in cancer types, treatments, and study methods. Chronic kidney disease was reported in 2.4% to 32% of participants in seven studies. Decreased kidney function was found in 0% to 73.7% of participants in 36 studies. Proteinuria, or excess protein in urine, was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants in 22 studies. Hypophosph
This text discusses two trials with 182 participants, involving two phytomedicines, Niprisan® and Ciklavit®. Niprisan® showed effectiveness in reducing severe pain episodes in sickle cell disease over six months, but did not affect severe complications or anemia levels. No serious side effects were reported. Ciklavit® showed possible benefits for painful crises but may have a negative effect on anemia levels. More trials are needed to determine the role of Niprisan® in managing sickle cell disease and the effectiveness of Ciklavit®. Phytomedicines may potentially
We reviewed 308 references and included three studies with 1,999 participants. The studies had a moderate risk of bias and were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One study was only available in abstract form, so we couldn't assess its risk of bias in detail. Two trials compared standard treatment (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) with PET-adapted therapy (chemotherapy only) for early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients with negative PET scans. The third trial had a more complex design, dividing participants based on prognosis and treatment type. Data for PET-negative patients were available, allowing for a meta-analysis of all three
We found 31 trials that fit our criteria, studying various contraceptive methods. No new trials were added in 2014. Most trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs), while others looked at different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables, a vaginal ring, and implants. No placebo was included in any trial. Out of 34 comparisons, only eight showed significant differences between study groups. Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, with few inconsistent differences from levonorgestrel COCs. A meta-analysis showed the desogestrel group had higher mean fasting glucose.
We looked at 10 studies and found that seven had a low risk of bias. However, the results might be affected by performance and detection bias since participants couldn't be blinded to treatment and most outcomes were self-reported. One study didn't provide enough data for bias evaluation. High-quality evidence from nine trials showed that exercise reduced pain and improved physical function immediately after treatment. Only three small studies evaluated quality of life, with no significant benefit from exercise. Moderate-quality evidence from seven trials indicated a higher likelihood of withdrawal from exercise, but this difference wasn't significant. Adverse events were rare and related to increased pain from exercise. Pain reduction and
Nine high-quality studies (260 participants) were included. Six trials compared exercise therapy to no exercise therapy, and three trials compared two different exercise therapies. Strong evidence supported exercise therapy for muscle power, exercise tolerance, and mobility. Moderate evidence supported mood improvement. No evidence was found for fatigue, handicap perception, or specific exercise programs being more effective. No harmful effects were reported. Exercise therapy can benefit patients with MS not experiencing worsening symptoms. There is a need for consistent outcome measures in exercise trials, controlling for treatment 'dose,' MS type, and ensuring sufficient contrast between groups.
A single study with 75 participants (average age 43, 65% female) compared early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 24 hours of diagnosis) to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (average wait of 4.2 months). The study had a high risk of bias. No deaths or serious surgery-related adverse events occurred in the early group, while one death and several complications happened in the delayed group during the waiting period. The early group had a significantly lower rate of serious adverse events, shorter hospital stays, and shorter operating times. However, this evidence comes from only one high-bias risk trial
This review included 11 trials with unclear bias, affecting the evidence quality. Seven trials focused on the main comparison and primary outcome. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis likely reduces the risk of surgical site infections (SSI) (moderate-quality evidence). The effect of short-term antibiotics compared to a single dose is uncertain (low-quality evidence). No adverse effects were reported, and no trial assessed other outcomes or compared specific antibiotics. In orthognathic surgery, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis lowers SSI risk compared to short-term prophylaxis, but it's unclear if short-term prophylaxis is better than a single pre-operative dose.
One study with 40 infants and 42 women showed no significant benefits or risks of elective preterm birth at 36 weeks for fetal gastroschisis. The main outcomes were caesarean section and neonatal survival. Two babies in the elective group died before discharge, while none in the spontaneous group did. Caesarean sections occurred in 33% of the elective group and 43% of the spontaneous group. No differences were found in secondary outcomes like birthweight, ventilation needs, and surgery requirements. Maternal outcomes were not reported. There was a small difference in gestational age at birth between the groups. The
Three adult studies met the criteria, lasting up to a week with 122 participants initially and 95 completing treatment. No studies were found in children. One study had parallel groups, and two had cross-over designs. All used paracetamol with strong opioids and other medications like NSAIDs, antidepressants, or neuroleptics. All studies had a high risk of bias due to incomplete data and small size. None of the studies reported primary outcomes like significant pain reduction, mild pain at the end of treatment, or patient improvement. There was no difference between paracetamol and placebo when added to other treatments. No evidence showed
Out of 15 trials, 14 took place in China and hospitals. The reporting quality was low, with unclear allocation concealment and missing or unusable data. Results are prone to significant bias. The main outcome measured was the wet patch size on the pillow. Antimuscarinics were the most tested drugs. Astemizole and diphenhydramine showed better results than placebo, but astemizole's doses can be toxic. Propantheline data was mixed but showed benefits over placebo. Side effects were poorly documented. Oryzanol and Chinese medicine suo quo wan showed benefits over doxepin
We analyzed six studies with 195 participants with MS. Two studies looked at inspiratory muscle training, three at expiratory muscle training, and one at regular breathing exercises. There were no serious side effects reported. We combined data from five studies (137 participants) for both types of muscle training. The results showed that inspiratory muscle training had a significant benefit on predicted maximal inspiratory pressure, but not on maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressure. Expiratory muscle training showed no significant effects. The studies did not report on health-related quality of life. Due to the low number of studies, we could not perform further analyses.
This review studied one trial with 38 women (41 pregnancies), but only analyzed 26 women (28 pregnancies). It compared betamethasone to no medication and found no significant difference in neonatal thrombocytopenia and bleeding. The trial did not study maternal death, perinatal mortality, postpartum bleeding, or neonatal brain bleeding. Current evidence shows betamethasone doesn't reduce the risk of these issues in ITP during pregnancy, and there's not enough evidence to support its use. The review calls for more well-designed trials and suggests not using betamethasone for ITP in
We found two studies from Iran with 111 participants who had moderate to severe keratoconus. They were randomly assigned to receive either DALK or penetrating keratoplasty. One study had 12-month follow-up data, while the other had follow-up data ranging from 6.8 to 36.4 months. Both studies showed no difference in post-graft visual achievement, astigmatism, or spherical equivalent. There was one case of graft failure in the penetrating keratoplasty group, but none in the DALK group. Graft rejection occurred in both groups but was less likely in DALK. Most cases
The study analyzed 67 trials with 8,506 women to examine the effects of iron supplementation. Results showed that iron supplements reduced anemia and iron deficiency, increased hemoglobin levels, and improved exercise performance and fatigue. However, they also caused more gastrointestinal side effects. Only 10 studies had a low risk of bias, and most lacked sufficient details about trial quality. Overall, daily iron supplementation effectively reduces anemia and iron deficiency while improving exercise performance and reducing fatigue, but it may cause gastrointestinal side effects.
This review included five studies with 1,726 patients and an ongoing trial. No decrease in overall death was found in the combined treatment group, but longer progression-free survival was observed. However, this result may be influenced by one specific study. The evidence quality for survival outcomes was low to moderate, mainly due to limited information on study methods. Higher risks of severe diarrhea and mild hair loss, and a lower risk of severe low white blood cell count were found in the control group compared to the intervention group. The evidence quality for toxicity was also low to moderate. No overall survival benefit was found for the combined treatment, so both treatments remain
The text states that due to various factors, it was hard to combine some outcome data. Despite limitations and possible biases, evidence suggests that a transverse or oblique incision has less impact on lung function, especially after surgery, and is less likely to rupture. Pain data is unclear, but a transverse incision might be less painful. There was no difference in other complications or recovery times, but a transverse incision may look better. Reduced painkiller use and lung issues may occur with a transverse/oblique incision, but it's not clinically significant. A transverse incision may lower the risk of wound rupture
This review included nine RCTs with 981 participants. Five studies took place in Europe and four in North America. Participants' ages ranged from 32 to 43.7 years. All studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, and four had additional bias sources. For subacute LBP, MBR led to less pain and disability, increased return-to-work likelihood, and fewer sick leave days at 12-month follow-up compared to usual care. However, when comparing MBR to other treatments, no significant differences were found in pain, disability, or time away from work. Return-to-work was not
We analyzed 18 trials with 4843 participants comparing bisphosphonates to control regimens for prostate cancer bone metastases. The primary outcome showed no significant difference in pain response. Secondary outcomes showed that bisphosphonates likely reduced skeletal-related events and disease progression but increased nausea and renal adverse events. There was no clear difference in mortality, osteonecrosis of the jaw, or decreased analgesic consumption. The benefits of bisphosphonates should be weighed against the increased risk of renal impairment and nausea. Future studies should focus on quality of life and pain using standardized assessment tools.
We reviewed 3046 references and included five studies with 1093 patients. The quality of these trials is moderate. They focused on stem cell transplantation and were open-label. Due to the small number of studies, we couldn't reliably measure differences between them. There may be bias in the results due to uncertainties in calculations. We found that high-dose therapy and stem cell transplant (HDT + ASCT) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in untreated patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). However, this didn't lead to a significant overall survival (OS) advantage. One trial confirmed these results when adding ritux
We analyzed 15 trials (1437 participants) studying WDD for schizophrenia. There was a high risk of performance bias, but low or unclear risk for other biases. Results showed WDD improved short-term global state compared to placebo or no treatment. When compared to antipsychotic drugs, no difference in short-term global state or mental state was observed, but WDD had fewer side effects. When WDD was combined with antipsychotics, it showed better global and mental state and fewer side effects. However, the evidence is not high quality. More well-designed studies are needed to fully test WDD's effects on schizophrenia patients
In this update, 12 RCTs with 799 participants were analyzed. Three studies had a high risk of bias, three had a low risk, and six were unclear. No studies reported root resorption. Six comparisons were assessed: 1. Multistrand stainless steel vs. superelastic NiTi arch wires: Five studies were in this group, but only two were suitable for meta-analysis. There is not enough evidence to determine a difference in alignment rate or pain between these arch wires. 2. Multistrand stainless steel vs. thermoelastic NiTi arch wires: Two studies were in this group, but meta-analysis was not suitable
This review looked at one study involving 306 older people with dementia in 16 French nursing homes. The study measured behavioral changes using three scales but did not measure any primary or secondary outcomes. The results showed improvements in four out of five areas for the intervention group, but no difference in physically aggressive behavior. The quality of the evidence was rated very low due to high risk of bias and indirect outcome measures. No differences were found in the other two scales, and one ongoing study was identified. The limited evidence means there is still uncertainty about the effectiveness of de-escalation and different techniques. More high-quality research is needed.
We analyzed 13 trials with 1316 participants who had incontinence issues and lived in nursing homes or hospitals. Most trials had small sample sizes and short follow-up periods, with a high risk of bias. Data was not suitable for meta-analysis due to differences in participants, products, procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools. Nine trials compared different skin care products, two tested structured skin care procedures, and two compared application frequencies. Two trials, with low and moderate quality evidence, showed that soap and water performed poorly in preventing and treating Incontinence-Associated Dermatitis (IAD). Using a skin cleanser or a washcloth
We reviewed seven RCTs with 333 participants studying the effects of antiviral treatments on infectious mononucleosis (IM). The trials varied in setting, participant age, antiviral type, treatment duration, and follow-up time. The antivirals studied were acyclovir, valomaciclovir, and valacyclovir. The risk of bias was unclear or high in all studies, and the quality of evidence was very low. Two of the 12 outcomes showed statistically significant improvements in the treatment group, but these may not be clinically meaningful. There was a reduction in time to clinical recovery and duration
This review looked at four studies with 2250 people comparing insulin detemir and glargine over 24 to 52 weeks. The studies had a high risk of bias. Insulin glargine was given once a day at night, while insulin detemir was given once or twice a day. There was no significant difference in blood sugar control or hypoglycemia between the two treatments. Insulin detemir caused less weight gain, while insulin glargine had fewer injection site reactions. No conclusions could be made about quality of life, costs, or mortality. The review suggests that both insulins are
This text discusses the results of various trials on the effects of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) for fecal incontinence (FI) and constipation. The trials show that SNS can improve continence in some patients with FI, but it does not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Adverse events, such as pain at the implant site and wound infections, were reported in some patients. More high-quality randomized trials are needed to better understand the effects of SNS for these conditions.
This simplified text includes two low-bias trials (n=190) that show molar bands have a lower failure rate and less decalcification than molar tubes. The data supports molar bands, but more evidence is needed for stronger conclusions.
We reviewed 66 articles from 1988 to 2012 on 7747 gastric cancer patients who underwent EUS staging. The study quality was generally good, with few biases. The meta-analysis showed that EUS was effective in distinguishing between different tumor stages and lymph node involvement. However, its accuracy was not optimal for confirming or excluding certain tumor stages and lymph node status. Despite its usefulness in guiding locoregional staging for gastric cancer, there was significant heterogeneity in the results. We could not identify a consistent source for this variation, so the findings should be interpreted cautiously. EUS performance was lower in diagnosing superficial tumors
We looked at six studies with 492 participants comparing day-case laparoscopic cholecystectomy (239 people) and overnight stay laparoscopic cholecystectomy (253 people) for gallstones. The studies had different numbers of participants, ages, and gender ratios. Only one study reported short-term mortality, but no deaths occurred in either group. Long-term mortality was not reported in any study. There were no significant differences in serious side effects, quality of life, pain, time to return to activity, or return to work between the two groups. Hospital readmission rates and failed discharges were also similar between the groups. Overall
This text discusses a review of eight studies with 2488 participants, which examined the effectiveness of high-concentration topical capsaicin for treating postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and painful diabetic neuropathy. The studies were generally of good quality, with only one at high risk of bias. Results showed that high-concentration capsaicin provided moderate or substantial pain relief for more participants compared to a lower concentration control. However, the additional proportion of people who benefited was not large. Those who experienced significant pain relief also reported improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. The quality of
We analyzed three trials with 6343 participants and pooled data from 6092 of them. After reassessing and redefining outcomes, we found no significant differences between trials. Surgery increased the risk of stroke for those with less than 30% stenosis, had no effect on 30-49% stenosis, benefited 50-69% stenosis, and was highly beneficial for 70-99% stenosis without near-occlusion. However, there was no benefit for near-occlusions. Surgery was somewhat helpful for 50-69% stenosis and highly helpful for 70
Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) met the criteria, with participants undergoing enterostomy for various conditions. The results were inconclusive for the incidence of parastomal herniation, development of ileus or stenosis, and skin irritation. The study did not measure other stoma-related issues or mortality but did measure quality of life, which was not an outcome of interest. Ten non-randomized studies (NRS) with 864 participants met the criteria. The reasons for enterostomy and participant characteristics varied between studies. All studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation), and one study reported data on
This text discusses a review of 24 studies with 2126 participants, focusing on the effectiveness of supportive therapy compared to standard care and other treatments. The evidence was of very low quality, and no significant differences were found in relapse, hospitalization, and general functioning between supportive therapy and standard care. However, other psychological treatments showed better results in some areas, such as hospitalization rates, mental state improvement, and patient satisfaction. There were no significant differences when comparing supportive therapy to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Limited data was available for comparisons with family therapy and psychoeducation. Overall, there is not enough evidence to determine if supportive
Eleven studies met the criteria and included 949 participants with mostly moderate or severe pain. The studies had various levels of blinding and compared different NSAIDs, but none had a placebo control. Most studies had a high risk of bias, and it was not possible to compare NSAIDs as a group or individually. The evidence quality was very low, and none of the studies reported primary outcomes of significant pain reduction or patient improvement. In four studies, moderate or severe pain was reduced to mild pain after one or two weeks, with varying success rates. Adverse event and withdrawal reporting was inconsistent, with two serious events and 22 deaths not
Two studies with 287 participants were analyzed. One study had 253 participants and showed that tinzaparin reduced pain severity and duration, and decreased hospitalization days compared to a placebo. Two minor bleeding events occurred in the tinzaparin group. The second study had 34 participants and showed that dalteparin reduced pain intensity more than a placebo after one day. The quality of evidence in both studies was very low due to risk of bias and imprecision. More research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparins in people with sickle cell disease.
We found no completed randomized trials. In 36 observational studies with 1285 patients, there were no significant differences in death or stroke rates when comparing antiplatelets and anticoagulants. There was a slight trend favoring anticoagulants for death or disability, but it was not significant. Intracranial and extracranial bleeding occurred only in the anticoagulation group, but there was no significant difference between the two treatments. No trials compared these drugs to a control, so there's no evidence supporting their routine use for treating extracranial internal carotid artery dissection. No trials
We found 26 studies (2066 patients) with various treatments and outcomes, making it difficult to combine the results. The findings were grouped by wound type and silver treatment. For burns, 13 trials compared silver-based treatments to non-silver dressings. One trial showed fewer infections with silver nitrate, but three trials showed more infections with silver sulphadiazine (SSD) cream. Six trials compared SSD cream to silver-containing dressings, with mixed results. One trial compared two silver dressings and found a lower infection rate with silver-coated gauze. For other wounds, six trials compared SSD/silver dress
We analyzed 12 studies with 3571 participants, comparing different antimicrobial treatments for adults with VAP. Some studies had potential bias and most had ties to pharmaceutical companies. We found no significant difference in mortality, clinical cure, ICU stay length, or adverse events between monotherapy and combination therapy. The quality of evidence varied from moderate to very low. Only one meta-analysis could be performed for combination therapy with optional adjunctives due to limited trials. One study showed a significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin compared to tigecycline. No statistical difference was found in mortality or adverse events between carb
We analyzed 29 studies on policies targeting 11 drug classes for restriction. These policies mostly affected senior citizens or low-income adults using publicly funded drug benefit plans. The impact of these policies depended on the drug class and whether restrictions were tightened or relaxed. Restricting gastric-acid suppressants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs led to decreased use and significant savings without increasing the use of other health services (6 studies). However, targeting second-generation antipsychotic drugs increased treatment discontinuity and the use of other health services without reducing overall drug costs (2 studies). Relaxing restrictions for antihypertensives and stat
This text discusses a review of 19 studies with 4232 participants, focusing on various oral health interventions and their outcomes. The studies were diverse and could not be combined for a meta-analysis. Instead, they were grouped into four comparison categories. Comparison 1 looked at one-to-one oral health advice (OHA) versus no OHA. Results showed very low-quality evidence of OHA benefits for gingivitis and plaque reduction, and a benefit for dental caries at 12 months. Comparison 2 compared personalized OHA to routine OHA, with very low-quality evidence showing no significant differences in gingivitis, plaque, or
This text discusses five small trials with varying participant numbers, treatments, and quality. The trials investigated the effects of oral steroids, intra-articular steroids, and manipulation under anesthesia for adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder). Results showed that oral steroids provided short-term benefits in pain relief, shoulder movement, and function, but these effects were not maintained after six weeks. Some trials suggested that improvement occurred earlier with steroid treatment. Minimal adverse effects were reported. Overall, the available data indicates that oral steroids offer temporary benefits for adhesive capsulitis, but the effects may not last beyond six weeks.
This text discusses three trials with 50 participants that compared rTMS and sham TMS for treating ALS. The trials had poor quality and high attrition, making it difficult to pool results. There was no detailed data on the primary outcome, and only one trial had data for secondary outcomes. No differences were found between rTMS and sham rTMS, and no adverse events were reported. However, due to the small sample size and methodological issues, rTMS cannot be considered completely safe. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of rTMS in treating ALS.
We analyzed 10 studies with 1049 participants and found mixed results for various treatments. One trial showed better disease control with plasma exchange plus prednisone, while others showed no significant differences. Chinese traditional medicine plus prednisone was not effective. Topical steroids were effective and safe for BP, but side effects and practical factors may limit their use in severe cases. Milder steroid doses were safe and effective for moderate BP. Higher starting doses of prednisolone did not provide additional benefits, and lower doses may be enough to control the disease and reduce side effects. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of combining treatments.
Seventy-five studies with 7957 participants with irritable bowel syndrome were analyzed. Three high-quality trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled, while the rest had lower quality. Seventy-one different herbal medicines were tested against placebo or conventional treatments, and some were combined with conventional therapy. Some herbal medicines, such as Standard Chinese formula, individualized Chinese medicine, STW 5 and STW 5-II, Tibetan Padma Lax, Chinese Tongxie Yaofang, and Ayurvedic preparation, showed significant symptom improvement compared to placebo. Out of 65 trials comparing 51 herbal medicines to conventional therapy, 22
We found 22 studies on the use of hormonal drugs, including levonorgestrel (LNG), to prevent pregnancy. These studies involved 12,400 participants from Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The results showed that pericoital LNG was effective and safe, with a pregnancy rate of 5.4 per 100 woman-years for the 0.75 mg dose and 5.0 per 100 woman-years for all doses. Other hormonal drugs seemed promising but need more research. Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effect, but non-menstrual side effects were mild. Most women liked the
This update includes 14 new studies, making a total of 15 studies with data from 561 patients. The studies took place in Europe, India, China, South Korea, and the USA, mostly involving adolescents or young adults. The gender distribution was similar in most studies, with more females in seven of them. The risk of bias varied across studies. Ten studies compared surgical anchorage to conventional anchorage for upper first molar movement. A meta-analysis showed that surgical anchorage was more effective by 1.68 mm, but this result should be viewed with caution due to heterogeneity. There was no significant difference in treatment duration
We analyzed 50 studies with 45,285 participants on the effects of statins in adults with CKD not on dialysis. The risk of bias in these studies was high. Statin therapy consistently prevented major cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and heart attacks compared to placebo or no treatment. The effects of statins on stroke and kidney function were uncertain, and potential harms were limited by lack of systematic reporting. Statins reduced risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and heart attacks in people with CKD without pre-existing CVD (primary prevention). Overall, statins play an important role in preventing cardiovascular events
We found 24,704 articles in our search, and nine trials with 379 participants met our criteria. These studies involved participants with cerebral palsy (CP) or osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), aged 2 to 19 years. Most trials were parallel-designed RCTs, with one cross-over trial. Three CP trials studied intrathecal baclofen (ITB), two studied botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A), and all OI trials studied bisphosphonates. No trials evaluated common analgesics for these patients. Pain was a secondary outcome in five of the eight studies. The trial quality
We analyzed seven trials with 1697 participants, but only six trials had data for analysis. Three trials studied efficacy, and four trials studied safety and tolerability. Five trials had a high risk of bias due to selective reporting, and three had a high risk of attrition bias. Low-quality evidence showed a small benefit of latrepirdine on the CIBIC-Plus after 26 weeks. However, it was unclear if latrepirdine affected cognition or function in Alzheimer's patients due to imprecise results. High-quality evidence showed a very small benefit on the NPI at the study endpoint. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that
This review included seven trials with 735 participants, analyzing the effects of RIC on preventing and treating ischaemic stroke. The risk of bias was evaluated and found to be low, unclear, or high in various aspects of the studies. Three trials with 371 participants focused on RIC's effects on stroke prevention. RIC significantly reduced recurrent stroke in people with intracerebral artery stenosis but showed no significant difference in carotid stenting patients. Adverse events were higher in RIC-treated participants, but no severe events were attributed to RIC. Four trials with 364 participants focused on RIC's effects on
We analyzed six studies with 204 preterm infants and found that adding protein to human milk helped them grow faster in weight, length, and head size. However, there was no clear difference in skin fold thickness growth. Protein supplementation led to longer hospital stays and higher blood urea nitrogen levels. There was no clear evidence that it increased the risk of feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, or altered serum albumin levels. No data were available on long-term growth, body mass index, body composition, neurodevelopment, or cardio-metabolic outcomes. In summary, adding protein to human milk can help preterm infants grow faster
This review looked at 45 studies, including 14 RCTs and 31 ITS studies, to compare the effectiveness of PEMs to no intervention. Most studies (44/45) made this comparison, while one study compared paper-based PEMs to CD-ROM versions. The results showed a small positive effect on professional practice outcomes when using PEMs compared to no intervention. However, there is not enough information to determine the effect of PEMs on patient outcomes or how PEMs compare to other interventions. The specific characteristics of PEMs that influence their effectiveness are also unknown.
We screened 5271 references and found 23 suitable RCTs. Most were in the USA and healthcare clinics, focusing on STI information and safer sex skills. Interventions varied in duration, provider, and goals. HIV and chlamydia were addressed, but not HPV or cervical cancer. Significant effects were seen in condom use, but not in abstinence or reduced sexual activity. Few significant effects were found on STI outcomes, and risk of bias exists due to unclear reporting. Interventions can be effective in promoting condom use. Future studies should focus on HPV, cervical cancer, and long-term follow-up. R
This review included 20 studies with 2337 participants. Most studies compared brief psychoeducation to routine care or conventional information delivery. Participants who received brief psychoeducation were more likely to take their medication and had lower relapse rates in the medium term. Some studies also showed improvements in mental state, anxiety, depression, and social function. However, there was no significant difference in quality of life or death rates between the groups. Overall, brief psychoeducation may help reduce relapse and improve medication compliance, but more high-quality research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.
We analyzed 11 studies with 9839 participants, mostly with moderate to severe COPD. One large trial with recent exacerbations accounted for 37% of participants. Most studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, leading to a high risk of bias. The one unsponsored study also had high risk of bias. Participants were from various GOLD categories, and follow-up ranged from 6 to 52 weeks. Results showed that LAMA+LABA treatment led to fewer exacerbations, better FEV1 improvement, lower pneumonia risk, and more frequent quality of life improvement compared to LABA+ICS. However, the evidence was of low or
We analyzed 3 studies with 91 children aged 6 months to 4 years, focusing on the use of heliox in treating croup. The studies were conducted in the USA and Spain, and the risk of bias was low in two studies and high in one. No new trials were added for this update. One study found that heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen for children with mild croup. Another study suggested that heliox may slightly improve croup scores for children with moderate croup when combined with dexamethasone, but the effect may not last long. The third study found
This text discusses a review of eight studies in primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings. The studies had a moderate risk of bias, with selection and verification bias being the main issues. The reporting of tests was poor. Vertebral fracture prevalence varied between settings. The review found that three red flags in primary care could be useful, but their estimates were imprecise. One red flag in tertiary care seemed informative. Combined tests were more informative than individual red flags. The evidence does not support using many red flags to screen for vertebral fractures in patients with lower back pain (LBP). Few individual red flags have good diagnostic accuracy,
Two studies were found. The first compared surgical urethral dilatation and optical urethrotomy in 210 men with urethral stricture disease. No significant difference was found in stricture-free men at three years or time to recurrence. The second study compared urethrotomy and urethroplasty in 50 men with traumatic stricture after pelvic fracture. In the first six months, more men needed further surgery in the urethrotomy group than the urethroplasty group. After two years, 64% of men in the urethrotomy group needed more treatment compared to 24% in the
Six trials met the criteria for inclusion, with a total of seven group comparisons. These trials included four pediatric trials and two adult trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed or suspected persistent asthma participated in the meta-analyses. There was no significant difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. Factors such as age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol, and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events. Compared to the daily I
We analyzed 17 studies with 1639 people with CKD, including dialysis patients, kidney transplant recipients, and those with CKD stages 1 to 5. The studies looked at dietary counseling, lifestyle advice, and various dietary patterns. The quality of evidence was generally low, and participants were followed for a median of 12 months. The studies did not focus on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events. Dietary interventions had uncertain effects on mortality and ESKD. However, they may improve health-related quality of life, kidney function (eGFR), and serum albumin levels, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
One study with 156 children (7 weeks to 24 months old) with bronchiolitis symptoms was included. They were divided into three groups: nebulised salbutamol, nebulised saline, and mist in a tent. Results showed improved respiratory distress in the salbutamol group, but not in the other two groups. The study didn't report any side effects. Steam inhalation is often used for bronchiolitis in limited-resource settings. The study found salbutamol effective, but mist in a tent didn't significantly improve symptoms. Since only one study was analyzed, it's not conclusive that
We analyzed four studies with 1,154 participants aged 50-90 years, all diagnosed with probable or possible Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Most were taking cholinesterase inhibitors. The main outcome measured was the change in ADAS-Cog scores. The results showed no significant benefit from statins (mean difference -0.26, P value = 0.51). Similarly, there was no significant benefit in MMSE scores (mean difference -0.32, P value = 0.10). Three studies reported side effects, but there was no significant difference between statins and placebo (P value = 0.
This review included four studies with 149 participants. Two studies examined night splints in 26 people with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A, finding no significant benefits. One study tested prednisone in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, showing some improvements but no significant change in ankle movement. Another study evaluated early surgery in 20 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which increased ankle movement at 12 months but had worse functional outcomes and relapses by 24 months. No intervention significantly improved ankle movement in either disease, and more research is needed.
Be cautious with the results as the quality of the 25 trials (5218 women) varied. In Comparison 1, labor was about 1 hour and 22 minutes shorter for women in upright positions. They also had fewer caesarean sections and epidurals. Their babies were less likely to need neonatal intensive care, but this was based on one trial. No significant differences were found for other outcomes. In Comparison 2, no significant differences were found between groups for various outcomes. Walking and upright positions in the first stage of labor reduce labor duration, caesarean birth risk, and epidural need without negative
This review faced challenges due to the absence of widely accepted criteria for diagnosing TOS. We found one study comparing natural progression with active intervention and three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but only two met our six-month follow-up requirement. The first trial involved 55 participants with 'disputed type' TOS and compared two treatments, with one showing better pain reduction. The second trial analyzed 37 people with any type of TOS, comparing botulinum toxin injections with saline placebo injections. No significant improvements were found, except for reduced paresthesias at six months. The review's complexity was due to the lack of standard
This text includes results from 21 trials with 884 people. Hand braces helped improve symptoms and function after four weeks. Ultrasound treatment for two weeks didn't show much benefit, but one trial found improvement after seven weeks. Oral medications like steroids showed significant improvement in symptoms compared to placebo, while diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs didn't. Vitamin B6 didn't improve overall symptoms in two trials. Yoga reduced pain after eight weeks compared to wrist splinting in one trial. Carpal bone mobilization improved symptoms after three weeks compared to no treatment in another trial. Steroid and insulin injections helped people with diabetes in
We analyzed two studies with 708 participants who had CRVO-ME. One study compared triamcinolone injections (165 people) to observation (72 people), while the other compared dexamethasone implants (290 people) to sham injections (147 people). Both studies had some issues that could affect their results. In the first study, 10% of people in the steroid groups and 17% in the observation group were lost to follow-up. The second study included participants with different conditions but didn't separate the data for CRVO-ME. It also showed no improvement in vision after six months with dexameth
Six studies with 394 patients were analyzed. Five of them showed that intranasal corticosteroids improved nasal obstruction symptoms and reduced adenoid size. Various corticosteroids were tested, and most showed significant improvements compared to placebos. One study, however, did not find significant improvement with beclomethasone. Overall, intranasal corticosteroids may help children with moderate to severe adenoidal hypertrophy, but long-term effectiveness is still unclear.
We looked at a small study with 24 women in Mexico that compared two groups: one received various medications, and the other received an epidural block along with some of the same medications. The study had some risk of bias, and it didn't report on important outcomes for this review. There was no clear difference in the baby's Apgar score between the two groups. Currently, there isn't enough evidence to determine the effectiveness, safety, or cost of using epidural therapy for severe pre-eclampsia in non-laboring women. More high-quality studies are needed to evaluate this treatment. The idea behind using an epid
We reviewed 16 trials on glucocorticosteroids for alcoholic liver disease. Most trials had a high risk of bias, and only one was not industry-funded. The trials included 927 participants who received glucocorticosteroids and 934 who received a placebo or no intervention. Participants were aged 25-70, mostly men, and had various stages of liver disease. Treatment lasted a median of 28 days, and follow-up was up to hospital discharge, death, or at least one year. There was no clear evidence that glucocorticosteroids affected mortality, quality of life, or serious adverse events up to three months
We analyzed four trials with 245 participants, but the studies were too varied to combine. Most studies had a low risk of bias, but some had high or unclear risk in certain areas. Interventions included driving simulation and skill development. Participants were mostly young, and the time after stroke varied. Primary outcome: no clear improvement in on-road scores after training in any study. Secondary outcome: better road sign recognition in trained participants. One study showed positive results for a simulator-based program, but this should be taken with caution. Adverse effects were not reported. There is not enough evidence to conclude if rehabilitation improves on-road driving
Eight studies with 582 participants were analyzed, with ages ranging from 65 to 73 years old and varying percentages of male participants. The studies focused on severe or very severe COPD and compared short-duration (3-7 days) and longer-duration (10-15 days) corticosteroid treatments. Results showed no significant differences in treatment failure, relapse risk, time to next COPD exacerbation, adverse events, hospital stay length, or lung function between short and longer-duration treatments. This suggests that a five-day corticosteroid treatment may be sufficient for adults with acute COPD exacerbations. However, more research is
We included one trial with 13 participants and found three ongoing trials studying red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategies in people with MDS. The evidence quality was very low. The study compared restrictive (8 participants) and liberal (5 participants) transfusion policies. There was not enough evidence to determine differences in mortality or the number of RBC transfusions. No complications or effects on activity levels were reported. The study did not report other outcomes like quality of life or hospital admissions. There is currently a lack of evidence for recommending a specific transfusion strategy for bone marrow failure patients. The one included trial had only 13 participants
The search found 2079 citations, and 2 RCTs were included. The first study used a game based on "Family Feud" for infection control, and the game group had higher knowledge test scores. The second study compared a "Snakes and Ladders" game with traditional learning for stroke prevention, and there was no significant difference in knowledge between the groups. The game-based group enjoyed it more. This review doesn't confirm or deny the usefulness of games for teaching health professionals. More high-quality research is needed to study the impact of educational games on patient and performance outcomes.
This text discusses eight studies with 475 participants, some with bipolar or unipolar disorders. The main finding was that lithium had a significant positive effect on preventing relapses, but this result was not consistent across all models. No other significant differences were found between lithium and antidepressants for various outcomes. Both lithium and antidepressants were effective in preventing relapses in unipolar disorders, but their relative effectiveness was unclear. When choosing long-term treatment, patients and doctors should consider the individual's history, side effects, and adherence to the treatment plan. More large-scale, long-term studies are needed for unipolar disorders.
Two trials involving 130 patients were included, both having a low risk of bias. No significant differences were found in xerostomia, technetium-99m uptake, and blood pressure reduction when comparing amifostine to placebo. Two patients experienced complications but recovered. Meta-analysis was not done due to inconsistent findings. The trials did not investigate death, morbidity, quality of life, or costs. Results suggest amifostine has no significant radioprotective effects on salivary glands in thyroid cancer patients. More trials with low risk of bias and patient-oriented outcomes are needed.
We analyzed three studies involving 45 children aged 29 months to six years with Down syndrome. The studies compared different parent-mediated interventions and treatment durations. Due to varying study designs and outcome measures, we couldn't conduct a meta-analysis. All three studies had a high risk of bias and small sample sizes, making them less representative of the target population. The findings were inconsistent, with some showing improvements in language abilities and others showing no difference. Parental stress scores didn't change significantly, but there were differences in how parents interacted with their children after the intervention. No study reported language loss, and one study found positive outcomes in children's
We analyzed two trials from 1987 and 2004 with 148 participants who had heart valve surgery. Both trials had a high risk of bias. There wasn't enough evidence to determine the effect of exercise-based rehabilitation on mortality and serious adverse events at 3 to 6 months follow-up. The trials didn't report on health-related quality of life and other secondary outcomes. However, exercise-based rehabilitation may increase exercise capacity compared to no exercise. There wasn't enough evidence at 12 months follow-up for the return to work outcome. Due to limited information, we couldn't perform a planned analysis. Our findings suggest that exercise-based rehabilitation
Five studies with 1130 participants were analyzed. Two focused on meditation and the rest on multi-disciplinary palliative care involving spiritual counseling. Meditation showed no significant difference in quality of life or well-being, but when combined with massage, it helped maintain quality of life. Palliative care interventions also showed no significant difference in these areas. The studies had limitations and provided inconclusive evidence on the effectiveness of spiritual or religious interventions for terminally ill adults. More rigorous research is needed, as all five studies were conducted in the same country and it's unclear if all participants received proper spiritual support.
We analyzed six trials with 137 participants to study the effects of tDCS on Parkinson's disease. The results showed very low-quality evidence for no significant effect on overall UPDRS scores, but some effect on motor subsection scores. There was no evidence of an effect on dyskinesia, gait speed, or health-related quality of life. No studies examined tDCS for improving daily activities. Two studies reported dropouts, adverse events, or deaths, but there was no significant difference between tDCS and control groups. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of tDCS on Parkinson's disease symptoms,
In this update, we included four more studies and excluded four from the previous review, resulting in a total of 12 studies. The overall quality of evidence was low to very low due to various limitations. Two small studies comparing LASB to placebo/sham showed no significant short-term pain relief. One study reported significant long-term pain reduction with thoracic sympathetic block but not short-term. Adding LASB to rehabilitation treatment showed no extra benefit. Most studies found no difference in pain outcomes between sympathetic block and other treatments. One study comparing guided and non-guided LASB found no significant difference in pain relief. Six studies reported minor adverse events.
Fourteen trials with 2488 participants were studied to understand the effects of antivirals and corticosteroids on Bell's palsy recovery. Most trials were small and had a high risk of bias. Four new studies were added in this update. The combination of antivirals and corticosteroids may not significantly affect incomplete recovery rates compared to corticosteroids alone. Corticosteroids alone were likely more effective than antivirals alone, and the combination of both was more effective than no treatment or placebo. Antivirals alone showed no clear benefit over placebo. For people with severe Bell's p
Two studies with 97 women met our criteria, one comparing LHRH agonist (leuprorelin) to chemotherapy (treosulfan) and the other comparing LHRH agonist (decapeptyl) to a placebo. A meta-analysis was not possible due to different control groups. There might be little or no difference in overall survival or progression-free survival between leuprorelin and treosulfan treatments, with very low-quality evidence. Quality of life was not reported, and side effects like hair loss and fatigue were more common with treosulfan. Other severe side effects showed little or no difference.
We found 17 studies on term and near-term infants with low oxygen levels. Ten trials compared inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) to a control group. One trial compared iNO to high-frequency ventilation, and six trials enrolled infants with moderate oxygenation issues. iNO improved outcomes in infants with low oxygen by reducing the need for ECMO (high-quality evidence), but it did not affect mortality. Oxygen levels improved in about 50% of infants receiving iNO. The presence of persistent pulmonary hypertension did not affect the response to iNO. Infants with diaphragmatic hernia did not show improvement with iNO (mod
This updated review included seven prevention studies (14,437 people) and eight treatment studies (1,361 people). The studies' quality was generally low, with only five meeting 50% or more of the internal validity criteria. There is moderate evidence that lumbar supports are not more effective than no intervention or training for preventing low-back pain. However, it is unclear if they are more effective than other interventions for treating low-back pain. High-quality randomized trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of lumbar supports, focusing on compliance, various outcome measures, patient types, and lumbar support types.
This update added one new study, making a total of 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of impregnations. The total number of participants was unclear. Most studies involved adults in intensive care units (ICU), oncology units, and patients receiving long-term nutrition. There were low or unclear risks of bias, except for blinding, which was difficult due to different catheter appearances. Catheter impregnation significantly reduced blood stream infection and catheter colonization. However, it did not significantly affect sepsis rates, all-cause mortality, or local infections. Subgroup analyses showed benefits varied
The review analyzed 15 studies, mostly from Bangladesh, India, and Peru, focusing on nutrient supplementation and educational interventions in slums or poor urban areas. It included 9261 infants, children, and 3664 pregnant women. The interventions involved zinc supplementation for pregnant women, micronutrient or macronutrient supplementation for children, nutrition education for pregnant women, and nutrition systems strengthening for children. The results were mixed, with some positive effects on low birth weight from education interventions for pregnant women, but no clear evidence of an effect on height-for-age or length. The certainty of the evidence was generally low to moderate. The review
This review included 12 studies with 1023 participants and found no significant difference in healing outcomes between various types of foam dressings and other wound treatments for venous leg ulcers. There were also no significant differences in adverse events between the groups. The quality of evidence is low, and more well-designed studies are needed to make definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of foam dressings in treating venous leg ulcers.
No RCTs evaluated the safety of withdrawn COX-2 inhibitors. Two RCTs with 381 IBD patients were reviewed. One study compared etoricoxib to placebo in IBD patients, and the other compared celecoxib to placebo in patients with ulcerative colitis. Both studies had low risk of bias but were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences. No significant difference in IBD exacerbation was found between etoricoxib and placebo or between celecoxib and placebo. The overall quality of evidence was low due to sparse data. Adverse events (AEs) were similar in celecox
We found 22 trials with over 2310 participants studying the effects of topical antimicrobial treatments on diabetic foot ulcers. Most studies had small numbers of participants and short follow-up periods. The studies used various antimicrobial treatments, such as dressings, creams, and solutions. Our analysis suggests that using antimicrobial dressings may increase the number of healed ulcers compared to non-antimicrobial dressings (low-certainty evidence). However, the evidence on other outcomes, such as adverse events, is uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Comparing antimicrobial topical treatments to non-antimicrobial treatments, the evidence was generally
We found no new studies for this update. Six studies with 5193 participants were included. The analysis showed that zinc supplements reduced pneumonia cases by 13% (low-quality evidence) and its occurrence by 41% (low-quality evidence). Zinc was more effective in reducing pneumonia with specific clinical criteria by 21% but had no effect on less specific cases. Overall, zinc supplements can help reduce pneumonia in children.
This review included ten studies with 33,179 participants. Most studies found no significant effect of vitamin A on acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) or their symptoms. One study showed increased LRTI incidence, while two others reported increased symptoms. Vitamin A had no protective effect in three studies. It reduced LRTI incidence in undernourished children but increased it in healthy ones, which is unexpected. Therefore, vitamin A should not be given to all children for LRTI prevention. Its benefits are limited, mainly helping undernourished populations. Low-dose vitamin A has fewer side effects and similar benefits to
Twenty RCTs were included in the study. Various therapies were used alongside the main treatment. Significant improvements were seen in FEV1, FVC, and VO2 max compared to placebo. Oxygen and carbon dioxide levels at rest also improved. However, walking distance tests and breathlessness scores did not show improvement. The risk of nausea was higher with theophylline, but patients preferred it over placebo. Few participants withdrew from the studies. Theophylline had a moderate effect on FEV1 and FVC and slightly improved blood gas levels in moderate to severe COPD. Improvements were seen with different therapies. Exercise performance improvement
We analyzed 10 studies with 439 children aged 1-18 years, comparing oral immunotherapy to control treatments for egg allergies. The main goals were to increase egg tolerance and achieve complete recovery from the allergy. Most children (82%) in the oral immunotherapy group could tolerate a small amount of egg, while only 10% in the control group could. However, 45% of children receiving oral immunotherapy could tolerate a full serving of egg, compared to 10% in the control group. Serious and mild-to-severe adverse events were reported in all trials. Serious events requiring adrenaline occurred in 8.4%
We analyzed four trials with 579 participants. The meta-analysis found no difference in long-term mortality between those who received ILR and those who didn't (very low quality evidence). No data on short-term mortality were available. Two studies reported data on adverse events after ILR implant, but a formal meta-analysis was not performed. Quality of life seemed similar between groups, but this was not confirmed by formal analysis. There was a trend towards fewer syncope relapses in the ILR group. Cost analyses showed higher overall costs for the ILR group, but lower costs per diagnosis. ILR implantation led to higher diagnosis rates (mod
We found four small studies with 275 patients and 282 hydroceles. They were divided into two groups: aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients, 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients, 123 hydroceles). The studies had low or unclear risk of bias. Blinding was not possible for participants, investigators, or statisticians. There was no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups, but there was significant heterogeneity. One study contributed to this, possibly due to the agent used or its age. When removed, the result favored surgery. Recurrence was higher in the sclerotherapy group
We looked at one study comparing a treatment (rhDNase) with a placebo in 40 children with airway issues and infections. The study had a low risk of bias. The results showed no significant difference in coughing after two weeks. However, the placebo group had better improvements in night time cough scores. Daytime cough scores were also better in the placebo group, but not significantly. Other outcomes, like breathing difficulty and lung function, also favored the placebo but were not significant. There is currently no strong evidence supporting any treatments for this condition. It is unclear if using rhDNase in children with airway issues worsens recovery
This text discusses a review of 21 studies with 2658 participants, focusing on the effectiveness of various psychological therapies for somatoform disorders or medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS). Most studies assessed cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and compared it to usual care or a waiting list. The results showed that psychological therapies, particularly CBT, led to a small reduction in symptom severity compared to usual care or waiting list conditions. However, these therapies were not more effective than enhanced or structured care. The overall quality of evidence in this review was low to moderate, and no major harms were reported. However, the lack of information on
In this updated review, we analyzed 63 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on regional anesthesia for preventing long-term postoperative pain (PPP). We found moderate-quality evidence that regional anesthesia may reduce the risk of PPP after thoracotomy and caesarean section, and low-quality evidence that it may reduce the risk after breast cancer surgery. There is also moderate evidence that intravenous local anesthetics may reduce the risk of PPP after breast cancer surgery. However, our conclusions are limited by the small size and number of studies, performance bias, null bias, attrition, and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies are needed,
This text discusses 28 trials with 1742 participants, testing various medications for mental health treatment. The medications include first and second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and omega-3 fatty acids. Recent studies focus on second-generation antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. The results show some benefits from second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but more research is needed as most findings are based on single studies. Antidepressants are not strongly supported for BPD treatment but may help with other conditions. No medication significantly impacted total BPD severity or core B
We analyzed seven trials with 349 participants, but the results were not optimal due to various limitations. The trials focused on the effects of different washout solutions for urinary catheters, but the data was insufficient to determine if washouts were beneficial or harmful. The evidence was of low quality, and more rigorous, high-quality trials are needed to compare different washout solutions, volumes, and frequencies.
We analyzed 30 studies with 18,682 participants in total. Eighteen studies focused on the main objective, while 22 studies focused on secondary objectives. There were significant differences between studies in terms of cancer diagnosis, treatment, participant age, fatigue assessment methods, and sample size. All studies had at least one unclear or high-risk bias item. We found both clinical and statistical heterogeneity, so we couldn't combine results and instead described them. Severe fatigue prevalence ranged from 0% to 61.7% among 18 studies with 14,573 survivors. In a subgroup of three studies with 268 child survivors,
We analyzed 36 trials with 6914 participants, using various antibiotics and patient profiles. In trials using both topical and systemic antibiotics, there was a significant decrease in respiratory infections and overall deaths. In trials using only topical antibiotics, respiratory infections decreased, but overall deaths did not. Topical and systemic antibiotics together reduce infections and deaths in intensive care patients, while topical alone only reduces infections. Only one trial studied antibiotic resistance, and it showed no negative effects.
Five studies met the criteria, all focusing on educational approaches. Two provided consultation, and two offered guidance for nurses. Four studies involved nursing home residents, and one involved group dwelling units. No community setting studies were included. Most studies had low methodological quality and inconsistent results. One nursing home study showed increased physical restraint (PR) use, while three others showed reduced PR use. The group dwelling unit study found no change in PR use. There is not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of educational interventions for nursing staff in preventing or reducing PR use in geriatric long-term care.
This text discusses a review of four studies (416 women) comparing glucocorticoid supplementation during IVF stimulation versus placebo. However, only two studies (310 women) had usable data. The evidence quality was low, mainly due to small sample sizes and few events. There was not enough evidence to determine any differences in live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple-pregnancy rate, or miscarriage rate between the groups. No side effects or safety issues were reported. The effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in IVF/ICSI cycles is unclear, and more research is needed.
This review included eight trials with 291 participants aged 5-23 years. Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment, and one trial compared placebo, standard-dose, and high-dose rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Most trials lasted one year, while two lasted six months. RhGH treatment may improve some lung function outcomes, but no difference was found between standard and high-dose levels. The treatment also showed improvements in height, weight, and lean body mass, with no differences between dose levels. Fasting blood glucose levels changed, but
We studied 26 non-randomized controlled studies with 1,695 participants, comparing complete removal from exposure, reduced exposure, and continued exposure to certain agents. Reduced exposure was achieved through various methods, such as limiting use, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment. For continued exposure, 56 out of 1000 workers reported no symptoms at follow-up. In 18 studies, removal from exposure was compared to continued exposure. Removal may increase the likelihood of reporting no asthma symptoms and improve asthma symptoms compared to continued exposure. Lung function may also improve with removal from exposure. In seven studies, reduced exposure was compared to continued exposure
The review studied six trials with 1,758 participants aged 48-57, except for one trial with an average age of 73. All participants had mild reflux issues and were outpatients. Five trials looked at on-demand deprescribing, and one examined sudden discontinuation. Low-quality evidence suggested that on-demand use of PPI might increase the risk of uncontrolled symptoms compared to continuous use, favoring continuous PPI use. However, on-demand therapy reduced the number of PPI pills used per week, favoring deprescribing. There was also low-quality evidence that on-demand PPI use might lead to lower participant satisfaction
We analyzed 13 studies (975 participants) comparing social skills programs to standard care or discussion groups for people with schizophrenia. Social skills programs showed improvements in social functioning, lower relapse and rehospitalization rates, and better mental state compared to standard care. However, the evidence quality was very low. When compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in outcomes. Most studies were conducted in China, so cultural differences may limit the applicability of the results. The effectiveness of social skills training in different settings remains unclear and needs further investigation through larger, multi-center trials.
One low-risk study met the criteria, pooling results from two RCTs with 225 participants. They were divided into three groups: biweekly pegloticase infusion, monthly pegloticase infusion, and placebo. The study found that biweekly pegloticase reduced tophi but increased withdrawals due to side effects. Monthly infusion had less benefit. Biweekly treatment resolved tophi in 21/52 participants compared to 2/27 with placebo. Monthly treatment resolved tophi in 11/52 participants compared to 2/27 with placebo. Pain relief, function, and quality of life were reported for all participants but
The search found five studies on using oral immunoglobulin to prevent NEC, but only three met the criteria. In a review of these three trials (involving 2095 newborns), giving IgG or a mix of IgG/IgA did not significantly reduce the occurrence of NEC, suspected NEC, need for surgery, or death from NEC. Based on these trials, there is no evidence to support using oral immunoglobulin to prevent NEC. No trials have studied using only oral IgA for NEC prevention.
Five studies compared additional chemotherapy to no extra treatment after hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Four trials directly compared platinum-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Analyzing data from 2197 women showed a significant survival benefit from added chemotherapy. Focusing on modern platinum-based chemotherapy, the risk of death was reduced, with a 4% absolute risk reduction. Overall survival and progression-free survival rates favored adding postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy. Chemotherapy lowered the risk of the first recurrence outside the pelvis but may be less effective than radiotherapy alone. However, it has added value when used with radiotherapy. In conclusion, postoperative platinum-based chemotherapy offers a
We analyzed 35 studies from various countries and income levels, focusing on digital health interventions. People's experiences with these programs were mixed, with some feeling supported and connected, while others faced issues like poor access to cell networks, internet, and phones. Privacy concerns were also raised, especially for sensitive health topics. Clients suggested using neutral language and tailoring message content, timing, and frequency. Preferences for delivery channels and message content varied. The sender's identity could also influence clients' views. Many trials didn't address these problems, but it could be a reporting issue. To successfully implement mobile communication programs, planners should consider these factors and barriers
This text discusses 23 trials with 2467 participants comparing methadone to other treatments. No significant differences were found in treatment completion, abstinence at follow-up, or withdrawal symptoms. The results were consistent across various comparisons, including methadone with adrenergic agonists, other opioid agonists, anxiolytics, and paiduyangsheng. When compared to a placebo, methadone showed less severe withdrawal and fewer drop-outs. Overall, the medications in the studies had similar effectiveness, but participants' experiences varied based on the medication and program. Comparing data from different studies is difficult due to varying outcome
This text states that nine studies with 1109 participants were reviewed. Antagonist-induced withdrawal is more intense but shorter than methadone withdrawal, and naltrexone doses can be established faster with this method. Sedation level doesn't affect withdrawal intensity or duration, but anesthesia duration might influence severity. Heavy sedation has a higher risk of adverse events compared to light sedation and other detox methods, without additional benefits. Due to potential life-threatening risks and high costs, antagonist-induced withdrawal under heavy sedation or anesthesia is not recommended.
We analyzed 14 studies with durations from 10 days to over 3 months. The data doesn't show a clear difference between molindone and placebo or other typical antipsychotics in terms of effectiveness. Molindone has similar side effects as other antipsychotics, except it causes more weight loss. However, the evidence is limited due to small sample sizes, poor study design, and incomplete reporting. Currently, there's no evidence to suggest molindone has an atypical profile.
We analyzed 20 studies with 2125 participants and 23 treatments. Data couldn't be combined due to varied treatments. Studies involved different interventions like bleaching agents, triple-combination creams, and unconventional therapies. Triple-combination cream was more effective at lightening melasma than other combinations. Azelaic acid (20%) was more effective than 2% hydroquinone but not 4% hydroquinone. Tretinoin showed mixed results, while Thiospot was more effective than placebo. Common side effects were mild and temporary. The quality of studies was generally poor, and better trials with long-term outcomes
This review included 12 trials with 1319 participants. The trials' methodological quality was not high, and many had a high risk of bias. The participants' ages ranged from 61 to 75 years, with 83% being white and 40% male. All studies lasted at least one year. A significant reduction in surgical failure was found in high-risk patients and those undergoing surgery for the first time who received regular-dose 5-FU injections after surgery. No surgical failures were found in studies assessing combined surgery. No difference was found in the low-dose 5-FU injection group. Peroperative 5
In a study of 16,154 participants, long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) did not consistently reduce lung function decline in COPD patients. There was no significant effect on mortality, but ICS did reduce the rate of exacerbations and slowed the decline in quality of life. The response to ICS was not predicted by certain factors in COPD patients. Side effects included an increased risk of oral yeast infections, hoarseness, and pneumonia. There was no major effect on bone health. Patients and doctors should weigh the benefits of ICS (reduced exacerbations and slower quality of life decline) against
This text discusses a study that included 80 trials with 5820 women, comparing 20 different NSAIDs for treating primary dysmenorrhoea (painful periods). The results showed that NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo, but they also had more side effects. When comparing different NSAIDs, there was no clear winner in terms of pain relief or safety. Only two studies used COX-2-specific inhibitors, and there was no evidence that they were better than traditional NSAIDs. NSAIDs were more effective than paracetamol for pain relief, but there was no difference in side effects. Most studies were
We analyzed seven studies comparing high and low PEEP levels (2565 participants). Five studies (2417 participants) compared high and low PEEP with the same tidal volume, while two studies (148 participants) had different tidal volumes. Three studies had a risk of bias, and the rest met trial quality criteria. Our main analysis focused on mortality before hospital discharge in studies with the same tidal volume. The meta-analysis of three studies showed no significant differences in mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01) or barotrauma risk (RR 0.97,
This review analyzed 42 studies with 11,399 patients, including 19 from a previous review and 23 new ones. Fifteen studies were excluded due to data concerns or missing information. The results showed that patients treated with HES fluids had a higher need for RRT and a greater risk of kidney failure compared to those treated with other fluids. The risk of AKI was also higher in HES-treated patients based on certain criteria. However, some results favored HES therapies, but this changed when specific outcomes were excluded. No differences were found between subgroups for certain outcomes, but there were differences for others, possibly due to
We found nine studies with 682 participants, but none mentioned blinding or group allocation methods. Seven studies had a low risk of incomplete outcome reporting, three had a low risk of selective reporting, and two were free of other biases. Seven studies compared Rheum officinale to no treatment, and two compared it to captopril, an ACE inhibitor. Rheum officinale showed positive effects on SCr and BUN levels compared to no treatment, but no significant difference compared to captopril. There was no data on all-cause mortality or treatment cost. Only minor side effects were reported with Rheum officinale.
Out of 72 papers on IQCODE test accuracy, 13 were included, with data from 2745 people (51% with dementia). The analysis showed a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.66. The test performed better in general hospital settings compared to specialist memory settings. No significant differences were found between the short and long versions of the test or the language used. However, there was significant variation and potential bias in the studies, which may affect the results' generalizability. The IQCODE can help identify older adults at risk of dementia in general hospital settings, and the language used does not impact its
We analyzed three low-quality studies with 91 participants, all focusing on different outpatient rehabilitation programs for adults with chronic stroke and upper limb spasticity after BoNT treatment. The programs included modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT), task practice therapy with functional electrical stimulation (FES), and occupational therapy with dynamic elbow extension splinting. Low-quality evidence showed mCIMT improved upper limb function and spasticity up to six months, while very low-quality evidence suggested dynamic elbow splinting and occupational therapy reduced elbow movement at 14 weeks. Task practice therapy with FES did not show significant improvement over task practice
This text discusses four studies with 136 participants. Two studies compared lamivudine to HBIg, with different timings. A third study compared lamivudine and HBIg to lamivudine alone, and a fourth compared lamivudine and HBIg to lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil. No significant differences were found in any comparisons. All studies were open-labeled and not powerful enough to show differences in HBV recurrence. No meta-analyses were done due to different comparisons in the studies. Clear evidence for treating chronic HBV after liver transplantation to prevent recurrence is
The text discusses a study that analyzed 15 publications with 1019 participants who were followed for three months to 10 years. The main focus was on the effects of sulphonylurea (SU) with insulin on metabolic control. The results showed that SU with insulin did not significantly improve metabolic control compared to insulin alone. Additionally, SU led to earlier insulin dependence in some cases. Vitamin D with insulin showed potential in protecting pancreatic beta cells in LADA patients. A novel treatment, GAD65, was suggested to maintain fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels. However, there is no significant evidence supporting other treatments for LADA.
This text discusses a review of 70 studies with 44,958 participants, focusing on the effects of social norms interventions on alcohol misuse among college students. The evidence quality was moderate or low, and the review looked at outcomes four or more months after the intervention. The results showed small decreases in alcohol-related problems, binge drinking, drinking quantity, and drinking frequency for some interventions, but no effects for others. The reductions in estimated blood alcohol concentration were also minimal. Overall, the review found no significant benefits from these interventions, and the small effects may not be relevant for policy or practice. Additionally, the results were inconsistent, and bias could
Three trials with 492 participants were studied to evaluate the effectiveness of hip precautions, equipment, and functional restrictions after total hip replacement (THA). The evidence quality was very low, making it unclear if these measures improved function, health-related quality of life, or satisfaction in recovery. No hip dislocations or adverse events were reported in the initial 12 months. One study compared hip precautions with and without postoperative equipment and restrictions. The results were uncertain due to low-quality evidence. Another study examined enhanced postoperative education and rehabilitation versus conventional rehabilitation, but the evidence was also very low quality. In conclusion, there is not enough evidence to determine
Three studies were analyzed. In two of them, the LNG-IUD group experienced a significant decrease in painful period recurrence compared to the control group. More women in the LNG-IUD group were satisfied with their treatment, but this wasn't statistically significant. The LNG-IUD group also had more women reporting changes in menstruation. In one study, the LNG-IUD group had lower pain scores than another treatment group, but this wasn't statistically significant. Overall, there is limited evidence suggesting that using LNG-IUD after surgery reduces painful periods in women with endometriosis. More high-quality studies are needed to confirm these results.
We analyzed 24 studies, most of which had concerns about risk of bias. All studies focused on food products and were conducted in high-income countries, mainly in the USA. Most studies took place in labs with adult participants. Six studies looked at the availability of food options, while 18 studies examined the proximity of food. The results suggest that reducing the number of food options and changing the positioning of foods can lead to changes in behavior. However, the certainty of this evidence is low. More research is needed in real-world settings, covering a wider range of products and longer time periods.
The text discusses the effect of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) on HIV seroconversion. There were no randomized controlled trials found, and only one case-control study was included. The study found that HIV transmission was linked to deep injury, visible blood, certain procedures, and terminal illness in the source patient. After considering these factors, no differences were found in PEP offers, but cases had lower odds of taking PEP. No studies evaluated the effect of multiple antiretroviral drugs for occupational PEP. Adherence and complications with PEP showed that adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen, but
In summary, behavior therapy shows little evidence of effectiveness, while cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has small positive effects on disability and catastrophizing, but not on pain or mood when compared to active controls. CBT is more effective when compared to treatment as usual or waiting lists, with some lasting effects on mood and catastrophizing. The quality of trial designs has improved, but treatment quality has not. CBT is a helpful approach for managing chronic pain, but more research is needed to determine which components work best for specific patients and outcomes.
We reviewed 881 documents and found 15 national initiatives involving over 260,000 people that met our criteria. None were in low-income countries, and all but one used an uncontrolled pre-post study design. Due to high study differences, we focused on individual initiatives. Ten provided enough data for quantitative analysis, but the evidence quality was very low. Five initiatives showed a decrease in daily salt intake per person, ranging from 1.15 grams/day less in Finland to 0.35 grams/day less in Ireland. Two initiatives showed an increase in salt intake, but their pre-intervention data was outdated. The remaining initiatives had no
We found 18 possible RCTs, but only seven met our criteria. These studies had a small number of participants (7-16 people) and used a cross-over design. Three studies had a low risk of bias, while four had uncertain risk. Various drugs were compared to placebos, and results were imprecise, showing possible benefit, no difference, or harm. Specific findings for each drug were as follows: 1. Amitriptyline showed no significant difference compared to placebo. 2. Bromocriptine had mixed results compared to placebo. 3. Clonidine showed a slight reduction in bruxism episodes
We analyzed 10 studies with 1015 participants, comparing enteral formulas or omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant supplements. Some studies had a high risk of bias due to methodological issues. The studies varied in many ways, including intervention types, calorie targets, and outcomes reported. All studies reported mortality rates. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality when using immunonutrition enteral formulas or omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant supplements. We are uncertain if these supplements reduce ICU stay length, ventilator days, or improve oxygenation at day 4 due to very low-quality evidence. The occurrence of adverse events,
The 33 studies mainly compared open questions with checklist-type questions or rating scales. Two involved participant interviews. The review found that specific questions detected more adverse events (AEs) than general questions. Six studies showed that severe or clinically relevant AEs were reported with open questions, while less severe AEs were reported with specific questions. However, two studies found severe AEs only through interviews, and others found no difference in AE types between methods. No conclusions were made about the question method's impact on detecting significant differences between study groups. There was no common statistical method, but some effect measures were represented as risk ratios for participants with at least
We found 592 records from various sources and removed 211 duplicates. After screening 381 records, we excluded 364 and assessed 17 full-text articles. We excluded 15 studies for various reasons and included one case-control study in this review. The study showed a protective effect of nocturnal supervision against SUDEP. However, the evidence is of very low quality. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of other interventions in preventing SUDEP in people with epilepsy.
The text discusses a review of 21 studies on autogenic drainage, a technique for people with cystic fibrosis. Out of these, seven studies with 208 participants were eligible for inclusion. The studies had different designs, durations, and participant ages. Most studies compared autogenic drainage to other airway clearance techniques, but none compared it to exercise. The evidence quality was generally low due to various reasons, such as the use of cross-over designs and lack of participant blinding. The most common outcome measured was forced expiratory volume in one second, followed by quality of life and forced vital capacity. Other outcomes included oxygen saturation levels
This text states that 25 studies with 1305 participants were reviewed, and 22 of these studies were used for analysis. The results showed that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective than standard treatment in reducing anxiety, worry, and depression symptoms. However, there were no long-term assessments comparing CBT to standard treatment. Six studies compared CBT to supportive therapy, and no significant difference was found between the two. The number of therapy sessions partly explained this result. In conclusion, CBT is effective for short-term anxiety treatment, but more research is needed to determine the best psychological therapy for treating anxiety disorders
Twelve studies with 1,856 women were included in the analysis. Eight trials compared treatment with placebo, while four compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The studies took place in India, Jordan, UK, and USA, and involved women who had experienced multiple consecutive miscarriages. Progestogen treatment varied in dosage and duration across the trials, which were mostly at low risk of bias. The analysis of all women suggests that progestogen supplementation may reduce the number of miscarriages compared to placebo/controls. Subgroup analysis showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. None of the trials reported on secondary maternal outcomes.
We analyzed 14 studies with 1298 participants, comparing different psychosocial interventions for pregnant women with drug use. The quality of evidence was low to moderate, and it was unclear if biases were controlled. No significant differences were found in pre-term birth rates, maternal toxicity, or low birth weight. However, newborns stayed in the hospital for fewer days with one type of intervention. No differences were observed in retention or abstinence at the end of the studies. The current evidence suggests no difference in treatment outcomes with psychosocial interventions, but more research is needed to evaluate their effect on obstetrical and neonatal outcomes.
We found 31 studies with 27,071 participants comparing two medical approaches: transfemoral and transradial. The transradial approach had better short-term results, reducing negative events, cardiac death, overall death, bleeding, and complications. However, it had a slightly lower success rate. There was no difference in short-term heart attacks between the two groups. Long-term results (beyond 30 days) are unclear.
We found two studies on palliative care for people with advanced dementia, but they had different interventions and settings, so we couldn't combine the data. The studies had 31 different outcomes, but none were the same. Six more studies are ongoing and may be included in future reviews. Both studies had a high risk of bias and low certainty due to small sample sizes and lack of blinding. One study (99 participants) looked at the effect of a palliative care team for hospitalized patients with advanced dementia. It found that a palliative care plan was more likely to be developed and available on discharge for the intervention group, but there was
Three trials with two sequencing comparisons were found. No significant differences were observed in various sequencing methods for adjuvant therapy based on 1166 women. Concurrent chemoradiation increased anaemia, telangiectasia, and pigmentation. Women didn't report worse cosmesis, but doctors did. Other toxicity measures didn't differ between sequencing types. One trial showed increased risk of neutropenic sepsis with RT before CT, but other toxicity measures didn't differ. Data from three trials suggest that different sequencing methods don't have a major effect on recurrence or survival for breast cancer patients if RT starts within seven months after surgery.
We reviewed nine studies with 622 participants to determine the effectiveness of CrP supplements for weight loss. The studies were conducted in community settings and had follow-ups up to 24 weeks. We aimed to find the most effective CrP dose compared to a placebo. We also analyzed the overall effect of CrP on body weight. We found a small effect on body weight after 12-16 weeks of treatment, but it was of questionable clinical importance. There was no strong evidence or clear dose gradient when comparing different CrP doses with a placebo for various weight loss measures. Only three studies reported on side effects, with a few serious events and
This text discusses a review of 11 studies with 886 participants, focusing on various treatments for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention. The quality of evidence was generally low due to small study sizes and unclear data presentation. No clear evidence was found for the effectiveness of different iodine preparations or zinc oxide mesh dressings. Moderate quality evidence suggested that sucralfate cream and honey-soaked gauze may improve healing, while low quality evidence indicated that Triclosan and Dermacym® could also be beneficial. However, due to the limited and low-quality evidence, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these treatments.
We reviewed five studies involving 1049 women, examining five different techniques during amniocentesis (three studies) or CVS (two studies). For amniocentesis, three interventions were tested, but no clear benefits were found. The same goes for terbutaline tocolysis and continuous vacuum aspiration during CVS. The evidence quality is not enough to change current practices. Without clear evidence, operators should use familiar methods. High-quality randomized trials on technique modifications with safety outcomes and the ability to detect significant clinical differences are needed.
This text discusses a study that analyzed the effects of folic acid fortification in wheat and maize flour. The study included 10 different research projects with varying participant numbers and study designs. Most of the studies were conducted in middle-income countries, with a few in high-income countries. The main findings were that folic acid fortification may reduce the risk of neural tube defects and increase folate levels in the blood. However, there was limited evidence for the effects of folic acid-fortified flour on hemoglobin levels or anemia. No studies reported any adverse effects. The limitations of this review include a small number of studies and participants
Six trials were found, with two involving 1,124,483 newborns (210 with CF) and a maximum follow-up of 17 years being eligible for inclusion. Due to varying study designs and outcomes, only data from one study was analyzed. Screened participants had lower rates of severe malnutrition and better lung function at age seven. However, long-term lung prognosis was influenced by other factors. Early screening for CF appears to be less expensive and offers nutritional benefits, with the potential for improved lung outcomes.
We found five studies with 7314 participants and an average follow-up of 4.5 years. One trial compared 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) and 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) blood pressure targets in 4734 people. The 'lower' target group had a reduced risk of stroke but no significant effect on mortality. This group also experienced more serious side effects. Four trials compared 'lower' and 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The 'lower' DBP group had a lower achieved blood pressure and a trend towards reduced total mortality
This text discusses 14 trials with 709 participants studying different treatments for foot ulcers. One study found no difference between two types of non-removable casts. Seven studies compared non-removable casts to removable devices, with five showing better healing results for non-removable casts. Two studies found non-removable casts more effective than dressings alone. One study showed that combining Achilles tendon lengthening with a non-removable cast led to better healing and long-term results. Other treatments, like surgical debridement and felt dressings, didn't show significant benefits. Overall, non-removable casts are more effective for
This text discusses a review of five studies with 235 participants, focusing on non-drug interventions for cognitive issues in breast cancer survivors. The interventions included computer-assisted cognitive training, compensatory strategy training, meditation, and physical activity. The studies had a high risk of bias and varied results, with some improvements in cognitive function and mental well-being. However, the evidence quality was low, so the findings should be interpreted cautiously. The effects of physical activity and meditation on cognitive outcomes are unclear. More research, including larger studies and other cancer patient groups, is needed to draw firmer conclusions about these interventions' benefits.
We reviewed 12 records of six trials from the 1970s with 343 participants. Five trials were included, and one was excluded. The trials had poor methodology and data reporting, with only short-term data available. The results showed no clear difference between chlorpromazine and piperacetazine in terms of global state improvement, mental state scale, or adverse effects. Both treatments had around 60% of participants experiencing adverse effects, with 40% experiencing parkinsonism-type movement disorders. There was no clear difference in participants leaving the study early. No data on negative symptoms or economic costs were reported. The review suggests that chlor
Five trials with 207 participants compared colorectal stenting (102 people) and emergency surgery (105 people). The surgery group had a higher success rate, but both groups had similar 30-day mortality rates (2.3%). Stent-related complications were acceptable, and stenting had benefits like shorter hospital stays, less procedure time, and less blood loss. However, more research with larger samples and better designs is needed to confirm these findings.
We analyzed nine studies (1867 women) comparing human albumin, HES, and mannitol to placebo or no treatment for preventing OHSS. The evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. Main limitations included imprecision, poor reporting, and lack of blinding. There was a beneficial effect of intravenous albumin on OHSS, but it also had a negative impact on pregnancy rates. HES showed a positive effect on OHSS without affecting pregnancy rates, while mannitol had a beneficial effect on OHSS but no impact on pregnancy rates. Live birth rates were not reported in any study. Adverse events seemed rare but were
Ten studies with 484 patients were analyzed. No sclerosant was found to be more effective than others, but they were better than a placebo. Patient satisfaction didn't differ between agents, but was lower with a placebo. Polidocanol (POL) and sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) had more side effects at 1% concentration. STS was more painful than POL, heparsal, or placebo, while POL was as painful as a placebo. Hypertonic saline (HS) was more painful than POL. Data couldn't be combined for analysis. No sclerosing agent was found to be better for
This review included seven studies with 241 participants, but a meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in treatments and insufficient statistical information. Most studies had unclear allocation and blinding methods. No study assessed the effectiveness of drugs in preventing serious outcomes like death or heart rhythm problems. However, some common treatments effectively lowered potassium levels in the blood. Salbutamol, given through a nebulizer or inhaler, significantly reduced potassium compared to a placebo. Intravenous and nebulized salbutamol had similar effects. Salbutamol was as effective as insulin-dextrose and more effective than bicarbonate after 60 minutes.
This review included 39 studies with 4216 participants, but only 30 studies with 3392 participants had enough data for analysis. The studies compared antimicrobial lock solutions (both antibiotic and non-antibiotic) to standard sealing solutions for catheters used in hemodialysis. The majority of studies had low or unclear risk of bias. Results showed that antimicrobial lock solutions likely reduce catheter-related infections (CRI) but have little or no effect on the risk of thrombosis. Antibiotic and combined lock solutions probably reduced both CRI and thrombosis risk, while non-antibiotic solutions only reduced C
We found 15 studies (1098 participants) on CMV treatment in organ transplant patients. Six studies compared pre-emptive treatment to placebo or standard care, eight compared pre-emptive treatment to antiviral prophylaxis, and one compared oral to intravenous pre-emptive treatment. Risk of bias was low in only a few studies. Pre-emptive treatment reduced the risk of CMV disease compared to placebo or standard care but did not affect acute rejection or all-cause mortality. Comparing pre-emptive therapy to prophylaxis showed no significant difference in preventing CMV disease, but pre-emptive
Three RCTs were included, studying 140 participants for six weeks to five months. The same trialist conducted all studies, and the risk of bias was unclear or high. The RCTs compared sweet potato preparations to placebo for type 2 diabetes. A significant improvement in HbA1c was found at 3-5 months with 4 g/day sweet potato compared to placebo. No serious side effects were reported, but other outcomes were not investigated. There is not enough evidence for using sweet potato in type 2 diabetes. Better trial methods, standardization, and quality control are needed. More trials should be conducted to
We found 62 studies, with 19 meeting our criteria. Five of these were used in a meta-analysis, while the other 14 had incomplete data. Study sizes ranged from 7 to 65 participants, aged 6 to 63 years. Most studies had unclear risk of bias and didn't blind participants or personnel. The studies compared various breathing techniques and devices, with mixed preferences among participants. No significant differences were found in quality of life, lung function, or other outcomes between the techniques. There isn't enough evidence to support or reject the use of the active cycle of breathing technique over other therapies. More long-term studies are
This text discusses a study that included eight trials with 733 women comparing brief co-incubation and standard insemination for IVF. The results showed that brief co-incubation may increase ongoing pregnancy rates and clinical pregnancy rates, but there was no significant difference in miscarriage rates. More trials are needed to determine if brief co-incubation leads to higher live birth rates and lower miscarriage rates compared to standard insemination.
In five studies with 694 infants, a long IT led to more air leaks and a slight increase in mortality before leaving the hospital. There was no significant difference in BPD rates. These results may not apply to modern neonatal care, as the studies were done before certain treatments were introduced. Most participants had a single condition (HMD), and other conditions were not examined. However, the higher rates of air leaks and deaths using long ITs are important, so infants with poorly compliant lungs should be ventilated with a short IT.
We analyzed 33 studies with 5110 patients, mostly of low quality. TFU has been used in various patient groups and performed differently. Many outcomes were measured, but few were consistent across studies. Due to diversity, only a few outcomes could be combined. Out of eight meta-analyses, five had significant statistical differences. The evidence for TFU's effectiveness is inconclusive, and the low quality of studies means results should be viewed cautiously. No negative effects were reported, but overall, TFU and control groups had similar results. We cannot conclude that TFU is effective.
We found 38 trials that tested six strategies to improve participant retention in studies. These strategies included incentives, communication methods, new questionnaire formats, participant management, and behavioral and methodological interventions. Most trials focused on responses to postal and electronic questionnaires, while a few looked at participant numbers remaining in the trial. Monetary incentives and offers of monetary incentives improved postal and electronic questionnaire response rates. Some other strategies showed promise in single trials but need more evaluation. The effectiveness of shorter questionnaires and disease-specific questionnaires was unclear. Recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed more effective than phone reminders, and a package of postal communication strategies with reminder letters appeared
We analyzed eight RCTs with 829 participants in two groups (pLMA and cLMA). Six cross-over studies are awaiting classification. Seven studies provided primary outcome data, and eight provided secondary outcome data. Our analysis faced challenges due to many studies reporting no events in either group. No significant differences were found between devices for the primary review outcome: failure to adequately mechanically ventilate. We assessed this outcome using two variables: inadequate oxygenation (four studies, N = 617) and inadequate ventilation (one study, N = 80). Establishing an effective airway took longer with pLMA (two studies, N
We analyzed 19 studies with 1453 participants aged 4-18 years, mainly from pediatric gastroenterology clinics. The studies tested probiotics, fiber, low FODMAP diets, and fructose-restricted diets for treating abdominal pain in children. Results showed that probiotics reduced pain frequency and intensity, with moderate to low-quality evidence. Fiber-based interventions had low-quality evidence and no significant pain improvement. Only one study each was found for low FODMAP and fructose-restricted diets, so no conclusions could be made. Overall, probiotics may help improve pain in children with abdominal pain, but more research is needed to
This text discusses a review of 22 studies with 4490 participants, focusing on the effects of mass media interventions on discrimination and prejudice. The results were mixed, with some studies showing a reduction in discrimination and prejudice, while others showed no effect or even an increase. The overall quality of the evidence was low, and there was limited information on costs, adverse effects, and other outcomes. The review found that mass media interventions may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice, but there is not enough evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. More research is needed to better understand which types of mass media interventions work best, to provide evidence
Our analysis includes 85 studies from 41 countries, focusing on the views and experiences of pregnant or postnatal women, healthcare providers, or both. We identified 52 findings and organized them into three themes: socio-cultural context, service design and provision, and what matters to women and staff. The last theme was further divided into personalized supportive care and information and safety. We found that women's use of antenatal care (ANC) depends on their perception of a positive experience, which is influenced by good-quality local services, cultural sensitivity, and respect for privacy. Women's beliefs about pregnancy and socio-cultural norms also affect their views on
This review included 16 trials with 3361 patients, studying the effects of calcium antagonists and magnesium sulphate on aneurysmal SAH outcomes. Calcium antagonists reduced the risk of poor outcomes and secondary ischaemia, with oral nimodipine showing the most significant results. However, the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. Magnesium sulphate shows promise, but more research is needed. Currently, oral nimodipine is recommended for aneurysmal SAH patients, while intravenous calcium antagonists are not advised based on current evidence.
We found three studies with 739 children that used one year as the age cut-off for pre-treatment risk. Myeloablative therapy showed better event-free survival than conventional chemotherapy or no treatment. However, overall survival was not significantly different when additional follow-up data was included. No significant differences were found in secondary malignant disease, treatment-related death, serious infections, or sepsis between treatment groups. Some adverse effects were higher in the myeloablative group. No quality of life information was reported, and all studies had limitations. Based on current evidence, myeloablative therapy improves event-free survival, but overall survival remains uncertain
We found eight clinical trials (632 participants) that met our criteria. These trials had a high risk of bias and low to very low certainty evidence. Participants' ages ranged from 16 to 78 years, with 60% to 75% being men and 22% to 85% having stage III liver cancer. The average follow-up time was 12 months. Combining TACE with 3-DCRT may reduce mortality and improve tumor response compared to TACE alone. However, it may also increase the risk of higher total bilirubin levels. The trials had methodological weaknesses, so the results should be
No suitable trials were found. Fourteen seemingly relevant studies were excluded because they didn't directly compare higher and standard energy intakes in infants with CLD/BPD. Two excluded trials offered some insights. One study found that CLD/BPD infants fed protein and mineral-enriched formula had better growth until the intervention ended at three months. Another study compared different energy densities but the same energy intake by adjusting feed volumes. Both groups couldn't reach the set feed volumes, and there were no differences in growth, respiratory outcomes, swelling, or diuretic needs. Currently, no trials examine the effects of increased versus standard energy intake for pre
In total, 13 studies with 2341 participants and 2360 procedures met the inclusion criteria. The evidence quality was mostly low or very low, with some moderate and high-quality outcomes. Most trials had unclear risk of bias, and there was significant heterogeneity among the studies. For the subclavian vein, two-dimensional ultrasound reduced the risk of accidental arterial puncture and hematoma formation. No evidence was found for differences in other complications, overall success, number of attempts, or time taken to insert the catheter. For the femoral vein, there was less data available. No evidence was found for differences in accidental arterial punct
This text discusses 15 studies on physostigmine administration for Alzheimer's disease treatment using four methods: intravenous infusion, conventional oral form, controlled-release oral form, and a skin patch. No usable results were found for intravenous infusion trials, and the conventional oral form showed no benefits compared to a placebo. Controlled-release physostigmine showed some improvement in ADAS-Cog scores for a specific group of patients, but also had higher withdrawal rates and side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. When all Alzheimer's patients were considered, there was no cognitive benefit and more side effects compared to a placebo at 24
We analyzed 13 trials with 16,112 participants. Most trials involved people with a history of heart disease or stroke. The overall risk of bias was moderate. The analysis showed that fibrates, a type of medication, had a protective effect against non-fatal stroke, non-fatal heart attack, and vascular death. Fibrates were moderately effective in preventing heart attacks but not effective against all-cause mortality, death from vascular causes, or stroke events. When excluding trials with clofibrate, a drug discontinued in 2002 due to safety concerns, fibrates were no longer effective in preventing the primary outcome but remained effective in
This text discusses a study involving 3285 healthy women with low risk of excessive bleeding during elective C-sections or spontaneous births. The study aimed to analyze the effects of a drug called TA in reducing blood loss. The results showed that TA was effective in decreasing blood loss and the need for additional medical interventions and blood transfusions. However, mild side effects like nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were more common with TA use. The impact of TA on severe side effects, thromboembolic events, and mortality is still uncertain and requires further investigation.
We looked at 12 studies with 2494 participants (1586 children and 908 elderly) comparing amantadine and rimantadine to treat influenza A. Amantadine was effective in preventing influenza A in children, but the evidence quality was low and the drug's safety was not well established. Rimantadine helped reduce fever in children on day three of treatment, but it did not show any preventive effect in the elderly. There was no evidence of adverse effects from amantadine or rimantadine. No studies assessed amantadine in the elderly. Due to the low evidence quality and limited
This Cochrane review included nine trials with 1512 women, mostly with unexplained infertility. Seven studies involved IUI, and two involved natural conception. The review examined intentional endometrial injury's effects on pregnancy and live birth rates. Results were uncertain due to very low-quality evidence. Endometrial injury may improve clinical pregnancy rates, but evidence is of low quality. Pain experienced during the procedure was 6/10 on average, but only one study reported this outcome. Comparing higher vs. lower degrees of injury and different timings of injury showed no significant differences in pregnancy rates. No effect was found on miscarriage, ect
We analyzed four studies (3905 participants) comparing professional oral care to usual oral care. One study (834 participants) was not combined with the others due to unclear differences between groups. We could not determine if professional oral care reduced nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) or the number of first pneumonia episodes compared to usual care. Low-quality evidence suggests professional oral care may reduce pneumonia-related deaths, but its effect on overall mortality is uncertain. One study reported no serious side effects, with minor issues like oral cavity disturbances and dental staining. No studies compared oral care to no oral care. While low-quality evidence hints at reduced pneumonia-related deaths
Five studies with 149 participants were analyzed, comparing various treatments for lymphocytic colitis. Two studies had a high risk of bias, while three had a low risk. Budesonide was more effective than placebo in inducing clinical and histological response, but the evidence quality was low. Mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may also be effective, but this needs further confirmation. No conclusions could be made about bismuth subsalicylate due to the small study size. More research is needed to confirm these findings and explore other treatments for lymphocytic colitis
This text discusses a review of twelve studies involving 3259 patients with type 2 diabetes. The studies examined the effects of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) compared to other methods or no monitoring. Results showed a small improvement in blood sugar control for patients using SMBG for up to six months, but this effect decreased after 12 months. There was no significant impact on patient satisfaction, well-being, or quality of life. Two studies reported costs, with SMBG being more expensive than other methods. The review concludes that more research is needed to understand the psychological impact of SMBG and its effects on diabetes-related quality of
Eleven studies with 471 participants with AsPD were considered, but data was only available from five studies with 276 participants. Two studies focused on AsPD samples, and eleven psychological interventions were examined. Only two studies reported on reconviction and one on aggression. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and contingency management showed mixed results for outpatients with cocaine dependence and drug misuse. A multi-component intervention using motivational interviewing, the 'Driving Whilst Intoxicated program,' was more effective than incarceration alone for drink-driving offenders. However, there is not enough evidence to support using any psychological intervention for adults with AsPD. Few studies addressed primary
This review analyzed 11 studies on the effects of antibiotics for common colds and purulent rhinitis. The results showed that antibiotics did not improve symptoms for common colds and had more side effects compared to placebos. Adults experienced more side effects from antibiotics, while children did not show a significant difference. Antibiotics also did not show benefits for persistent purulent rhinitis. Due to these findings, the routine use of antibiotics for common colds and purulent rhinitis is not recommended.
We analyzed five trials with 162 participants, studying the effects of various treatments for guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis. Participants' ages ranged from 12 to 77 years, and their initial PASI scores varied from mild to severe. Due to differences in participant characteristics and interventions, we did not perform a meta-analysis. The trials assessed different treatments, including penicillin, erythromycin, rifampicin, azithromycin, and tonsillectomy. However, the quality of the evidence was very low, and we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of these treatments for psoriasis. The trials had
We found 12 studies with 933 participants with MS, where 464 took vitamin D and 469 were in a comparison group. Most trials tested vitamin D₃, and one tested vitamin D₂. The results show that vitamin D₃ had no significant effect on relapse rate, disability status, or MRI lesions after 52 weeks. It also did not increase the risk of serious or minor side effects. The impact of vitamin D on quality of life and fatigue is unclear. Overall, there is very low-quality evidence suggesting no benefit of vitamin D for people with MS. However, vitamin D₃ seems safe at the doses
In this update, we found seven new studies. Six were excluded, and one is ongoing. The review now has 62 studies with 4,241 participants. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor reporting of randomization and allocation concealment. The main outcomes were pain and pain relief reported by participants. Fifteen studies compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) with immediate release (MIR). Fourteen studies compared different strengths of Mm/r, and fifteen compared Mm/r with other opioids. Six studies compared MIR with other opioids. Other comparisons included different routes of administration, timings, and
This text discusses a review of 14 trials with 1260 participants, aged 16-88 years, mostly women, who had trigger fingers. The trials compared various treatments, with the main focus on open surgery versus steroid injections. Most studies had significant flaws and biases. The primary comparison showed low-quality evidence that open surgery may result in less recurrence of trigger finger but is more painful than steroid injections. However, the evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws and imprecision. At one week, more people experienced pain with open surgery than with steroid injections. Very low-quality evidence from two trials made it uncertain whether open surgery improved the
Three studies involving 931 participants tested various neoadjuvant treatments for cancer. These treatments included radiation therapy (RT) alone, RT followed by a combination of chemotherapy drugs (PCV), PCV alone, and temozolomide chemotherapy alone. The studies were not blinded, making them prone to bias, but were otherwise reliable. One study showed that combining RT and PCV led to longer overall survival (3.5 years) compared to RT alone (2.6 years). This finding was not evident in a previous review. Two of the studies found that certain biomarkers (chromosome deletions and IDH mutations) were
We studied five trials with 240 children aged 1-18 years with mild to moderate sleep apnea. Three trials compared nasal steroids to placebo, and two trials compared oral montelukast to placebo. We are unsure if nasal steroids are effective, but children taking oral montelukast had better results. Side effects were rare and minor. No study looked at avoiding surgery for sleep apnea. There isn't enough evidence for nasal steroids' effectiveness, but montelukast showed short-term benefits. Long-term safety and effectiveness data are still needed, as well as studies on patient-centered outcomes. Future trials should focus on long-term
This text discusses a study that looked at different treatments to prevent blood clots in children with cancer who have central venous catheters (CVCs). The study included six trials with 1291 children and various treatments. The results showed no significant difference in preventing blood clots or side effects between the treatment groups and the control groups. However, one trial found that combining two treatments (LMWH and AT) significantly reduced blood clots without causing bleeding complications. The studies had some limitations, and more research is needed to provide clear recommendations for clinical practice. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes and possibly include participants with higher risk factors
Three trials with 287 participants having Type I or II TAAA surgery were included. The first trial had 98 participants and found no significant benefit of CSFD in preventing spinal cord injury. The second trial with 33 participants used CSFD and intrathecal papaverine, showing a significant reduction in postoperative neurological deficit. The third trial had 145 participants and found an 80% reduction in postoperative deficits with CSFD. Meta-analysis showed an odds ratio of 0.48 for CSFD. Limited data supports CSFD's role in preventing neurological injury during TAAA surgery, and more studies are needed.
We analyzed 13 studies with 662 participants and focused on participant-rated improvement, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, side-effect withdrawals, and clearance rate. One study comparing NB-UVB and oral PUVA showed no significant difference in PASI 75. Three other studies had inconsistent clearance rates. Withdrawals due to side effects were not significantly different between groups. Evidence comparing NB-UVB with bath PUVA was also inconsistent. Two studies found similar effects between NB-UVB plus retinoid and PUVA plus retinoid for treating CPP or GP. One study found no significant differences between NB
We found 21 studies with 1525 participants. About half had a low risk of bias. One small trial showed biofeedback plus exercises was better than exercises alone. Another small trial showed adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone. Two trials showed that electrical stimulation with biofeedback was better than biofeedback alone. Sacral nerve stimulation was better than conservative management, including biofeedback and PFMT. There wasn't enough evidence to determine the best method of biofeedback or exercises. Rectal volume discrimination training may improve continence more than sham training. The limited number of trials and their methodological weaknesses make it difficult
We reviewed 39 randomized trials on urinary catheter use after surgery. Most trials were small and had limited data. The results suggest that not using a catheter may increase the risk of needing one later. Comparing urethral and suprapubic catheters, the latter had fewer cases of recatheterization. Removing a catheter earlier seemed to reduce urinary tract infections. One trial showed that clamping and releasing a catheter before removal increased infections and delayed normal voiding. Due to the small size and low quality of trials, no strong conclusions can be made. The decision to use a specific catheter policy depends on balancing infection
This text discusses a review of ten studies with 3340 participants that examined the effectiveness of aripiprazole for treating mania. The studies compared aripiprazole to placebo, lithium, and haloperidol. The results showed that aripiprazole was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms at three and four weeks, but not at six weeks. There were no significant differences between aripiprazole and other drug treatments in reducing manic symptoms. Aripiprazole caused more movement disorders, gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea and constipation), and lowered prolactin levels in children and adolescents.
Two RCTs and one CCT studied the effectiveness of urokinase and ethanol lock treatments combined with systemic antibiotics compared to just systemic antibiotics for treating CVC-related infections. The studies had limitations and varied in their methods. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups in terms of cure rates, recurrence, time to negative blood culture, CVC removal, ICU admission, and sepsis. Not all studies were included in every analysis. No adverse events were reported in the cohort studies, but some mentioned CVC malfunctioning. No studies focused on antibiotic lock treatment alone. More well-designed RCTs are needed to better understand the
Out of 15 trials, three had low bias risk and three main themes were identified. 1. Activation advice: Moderate quality evidence from one trial (348 participants) showed that an educational video on activation was more beneficial for acute whiplash-related pain compared to no treatment in the intermediate-term, but not in the long-term. Low quality evidence from one trial (102 participants) suggested that a whiplash pamphlet on activation advice was less effective for pain reduction or had no difference in improving function and global perceived improvement compared to generic information given in emergency care for acute whiplash. Low to very low quality evidence from nine trials
This text discusses a Cochrane review that found no studies meeting its criteria. However, 49 studies from broader literature were used for a thematic synthesis. The synthesis suggests that effective communication should be a long-term, multi-component program, tailored to individual needs and supported by education and healthcare access monitoring. Poor communication can lead to negative effects like discrimination. There isn't enough strong evidence to determine the best approach for notifying and supporting people at risk of CJD or vCJD. The synthesis can still help inform policy and practice decisions in the absence of rigorous studies.
A single clinical trial (304 participants) studied the effects of opioids (extended-release oxycodone/naloxone) on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) compared to a placebo. After 12 weeks, RLS symptoms improved more in the drug group, with more drug responders and remitters. Quality of life and sleep also improved more in the drug group. However, there was no difference in daytime sleepiness or napping. The drug group experienced more side effects, mainly gastrointestinal issues, fatigue, and headaches. Opioids may be effective for RLS, but safety concerns remain. This conclusion is based on one study
This text discusses a study of 15 trials with 1022 adults who had specific types of wrist fractures. The trials compared two treatments: external fixation and plaster cast immobilization. There were differences in patient characteristics and interventions among the trials, and some methodological weaknesses were noted. External fixation was better at maintaining the fracture position and preventing further issues compared to plaster cast immobilization. However, there wasn't enough evidence to show that external fixation had better overall results. External fixation had more complications, like infections, but most were minor. Some complications might have been avoided with different surgical techniques. There was no significant difference in serious complications between the
We analyzed five studies with 1127 patients. The studies had low or unclear bias and used a randomized design. It's unclear if removing stents early or late affects MUC rates. Early stent removal might lower UTI rates, especially with BI stents. No difference was found with externalized PU stents. Data on cost and quality of life were missing. Early stent removal after kidney transplant may reduce UTI rates, but the effect on MUC is uncertain. BI stents seem to be the best option for this benefit.
We analyzed five studies with three comparisons. Four studies compared crowns to fillings, two compared conventional PMCs to open sandwich restorations, and two compared PMCs using the Hall Technique to fillings. One study had a third comparison of PMCs (using the Hall Technique) to non-restorative caries treatment. In two studies, all teeth had pulpotomy before crown placement. The last study compared PMCs to aesthetic stainless steel crowns with white veneers. No RCT evidence compared different PMC fitting methods. We looked at short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term (12 months or more) outcomes
This text discusses a review of 28 studies involving 788 participants, which compared various airway clearance techniques for people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The main focus was on the positive expiratory pressure (PEP) technique. The review found that PEP and other methods had similar effects on forced expiratory volume, but long-term studies had mixed results. PEP with a mask for at least one year showed a lower rate of respiratory exacerbations compared to other techniques. Participants generally preferred PEP over other methods. The review also looked at mucus clearance and adverse events, but there was not enough high-quality evidence to
Four studies with 1485 participants with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) were analyzed. All participants had active CD and were mostly adults. One study had a high risk of bias, while others had low risk. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) was more effective than a placebo in achieving clinical remission and response at week 8. Serious side effects were observed in both CZP and placebo groups, including worsening CD, infections, and cancer. It is unclear if the risk of serious side effects differs between CZP and placebo. More research is needed to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of
We reviewed 112 studies on heart failure treatments in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The studies had varying quality and sizes, with follow-up periods ranging from three months to five years. Our analysis included 26 studies with relevant data. The effects of several treatments on death, hospitalizations, worsening heart failure, kidney function, and other outcomes were uncertain due to limited data. Beta-blockers may reduce the risk of death and hospitalization for heart failure, while aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of high potassium levels. The effects of other treatments, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and various other medications, were unclear
This text discusses three studies with 1945 women in total. The risk of bias in these trials was mixed. No serious complications, neonatal, or maternal deaths were reported. The neonatal outcomes were not significantly different between groups, and there was no significant difference in the risk for instrumental delivery. Hyperstimulation was reported in two studies, but there was no significant difference between groups. The review found no differences between internal or external monitoring methods for maternal or neonatal outcomes. Since the review is based on three moderate-quality studies with 1945 women, there isn't enough evidence to recommend one monitoring method over another when using intravenous
We analyzed two trials with 54 participants with CVI. Many outcomes were not reported or only reported in one study. Both studies measured disease intensity but used different scales, so we couldn't combine the data. One study found no difference between exercise and control groups, while the other found reduced symptoms in the exercise group. One study reported no difference in quality of life or ankle range of motion between groups. Muscle strength at slow speed was similar, but variable peak torque at fast speed was lower in the control group. Venous leg ulcers, surgical intervention, and exercise capacity were not assessed or reported in either trial. Both studies had a
This text discusses a study that analyzed 76 trials on various treatments for knee osteoarthritis (OA). The trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, physical therapy, exercise, arthroscopy, and conventional treatment. The results showed that viscosupplementation, a type of hyaluronan/hylan treatment, was generally effective in reducing pain and improving function, especially 5 to 13 weeks after injection. The effectiveness varied depending on the specific product, comparison, and timepoint. Few adverse events were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials, and the treatment
This review included ten clinical trials with 4052 participants, studying the effects of misoprostol and other treatments for primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The results showed that misoprostol, when used with other uterotonics, did not provide additional benefits for primary outcomes such as maternal mortality and serious morbidity. When comparing misoprostol to oxytocin infusion, both treatments had similar outcomes, but oxytocin had fewer side effects. The review also found that adding misoprostol to oxytocin treatment did not offer extra benefits. The effectiveness of tranexamic acid and compression methods needs
Six trials met the entry criteria, mostly involving preterm patients. Five small trials looked at short-term cysteine supplementation in cysteine-free PN, while one large trial examined N-acetylcysteine supplementation in cysteine-containing PN for very low birth weight infants. Growth wasn't significantly impacted by either supplementation. Nitrogen retention increased with cysteine supplementation (4 trials), and plasma cysteine levels also increased. N-acetylcysteine supplementation didn't significantly affect risks of various health issues. Evidence from trials shows that short-term cysteine supplementation in preterm infants improves nitrogen balance, but there's
We analyzed 77 trials with 6287 participants for this review. Only one trial had a low risk of bias, while the others had a high risk of bias in one or more areas. The evidence quality was very low. The trials focused on non-alcohol related steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetes, and non-diabetic participants. The follow-up period ranged from one to 24 months. We compared active intervention versus no intervention for mortality, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life. For antioxidants, bile acids, and thiazolidinediones, there was no significant difference in these outcomes compared to no
A total of 1282 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were identified in 15 studies, with 1172 having analyzable data. 430 participants converted to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 130 to other forms of dementia. Follow-up times varied, but most were between one to three years. The accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers t-tau, p-tau, and p-tau/ABeta ratio were evaluated in different studies, with varying sensitivity and specificity values. The studies had poor reporting and unclear risk of bias, with eight out of 15 being of poor method
We analyzed three studies with 170 male participants undergoing robotic prostate surgery. The results showed no significant difference in postoperative pain between the two types of anesthesia. However, propofol may reduce short-term nausea and vomiting and prevent increased eye pressure during surgery compared to inhaled anesthesia. The overall quality of evidence is low, and it's unclear which anesthesia technique is better for robotic surgeries in urology, gynecology, and gastroenterology. An ongoing trial involving both genders may impact future evidence on this topic.
In this update, 7 new observational studies were added, making a total of 14 studies with 1,601,515 participants. Most studies found no link between maternal use of topical corticosteroids and pregnancy outcomes like mode of delivery, congenital abnormalities, preterm delivery, fetal death, and low Apgar score. The update also analyzed the effects of different corticosteroid potencies and found no association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there may be a link between low birth weight and the use of potent topical corticosteroids, which needs further investigation. Mild to moderate corticosteroids might have a
We found four studies with 611 participants that fit our review criteria. These studies compared bacterial keratitis treatment with and without topical corticosteroids and had follow-up periods from two months to one year. They were conducted in the USA, Canada, India, and South Africa. No significant differences were found in visual acuity, re-epithelialization time, or adverse events between the corticosteroid and control groups. One study reported no difference in quality of life between the two groups. No economic outcome reports were found. Although the studies were well-designed, they had some limitations, such as considerable losses to follow-up and
We analyzed four trials with 450 participants, and data on functional outcome and death were available for 443 participants from three trials. There was no significant improvement in functional outcome with percutaneous vascular intervention compared to intravenous thrombolytic therapy. The evidence quality was low due to blinding issues. There was also no significant difference in death rates or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages between the two groups. Data on vascular status was insufficient for analysis. This review compared intravenous thrombolytic treatment and percutaneous vascular interventions for stroke, finding no evidence that the latter is superior. The evidence quality was low, and
In a review of one study with 120 families and 143 children, there was no clear evidence that center-based day care improved children's cognitive or psychosocial development, or parents' employment and income. The study had a high risk of bias and did not report long-term outcomes for children. The review cannot provide strong guidance on the effects of day care based on this limited evidence. More studies are needed to compare different day care options and their effects on children and families.
A total of 126 reports on 30 scoring indices were found. Eleven indices had some validation, with eight assessing intra-rater reliability and all 11 evaluating inter-rater reliability. Three indices had content validation, two assessed criterion validity, and six explored content validity. Two indices were tested for responsiveness. The Nancy Index and Robarts Histopathology Index had the most validation, testing four properties. However, no histologic scoring indices are fully validated. More research is needed to find the optimal endpoint for histologic healing in UC and create a fully validated index.
We analyzed three trials with 213 participants comparing intramedullary nailing and plating for distal tibial fractures. The trials had a high risk of bias, and the evidence quality was very low. Although nailing showed a small advantage in foot and ankle function and fewer reoperations, the differences were not clinically significant. There was no evidence comparing surgical and non-surgical treatments. In conclusion, there is not enough evidence to determine the best surgical approach for these fractures. More research is needed to answer this question and identify other priorities.
We analyzed 11 studies with 38,742 participants. Eight studies compared blood pressure-lowering drugs (BPLDs) to placebos (35,110 participants), and three studies compared different blood pressure targets (3,632 participants). The risk of bias varied among the studies. BPLDs reduced the risk of recurrent stroke by 19% (moderate-quality evidence), major vascular events by 10% (high-quality evidence), and dementia by 12% (high-quality evidence). The reduced risk of recurrent stroke was mainly seen in participants using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or a diure
In four studies with 519 men, non-glucosidic B-sitosterols were found to improve urinary symptoms and flow. However, they did not significantly reduce prostate size compared to a placebo. The long-term effectiveness, safety, and ability to prevent complications are still unknown.
The text discusses a review of 26 trials comparing salmeterol to placebo and eight trials comparing it to salbutamol, involving 62,815 participants with asthma, including 2,599 children. In six trials, no serious adverse event data was available. All-cause mortality was slightly higher with regular salmeterol than placebo, but not significantly. Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased with regular salmeterol compared to placebo. There isn't enough evidence to determine the risk in children compared to adults. No significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events was found when comparing regular salmeterol to regular
Two studies involving preterm infants with breathing difficulties were conducted by Amato in 1988 and 1989. Both studies had methodological issues and did not report significant benefits from using thyroid hormones. A meta-analysis of these studies (80 infants) found no significant difference in mortality or other health outcomes. There is no evidence from these trials that postnatal thyroid hormone treatment reduces the severity of breathing problems or improves health outcomes in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.
We analyzed 38 RCTs with 1828 participants. Eight RCTs had a low risk of bias for mortality assessment. All trials had a high risk of bias for other outcomes. The analysis showed that non-absorbable disaccharides had a positive effect on mortality and hepatic encephalopathy compared to placebo/no intervention. They also helped reduce serious adverse events related to liver disease. There were no significant differences between RCTs for prevention, overt, or minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Non-absorbable disaccharides may improve quality of life, but more evidence is needed. They were associated
In a 2019 update, 65 studies with 3598 participants were analyzed, focusing on various treatments for bone disease in kidney transplant patients. The treatments included bisphosphonates, vitamin D compounds, and others. The studies mainly evaluated bone density and related factors, with a median follow-up of 12 months. Bisphosphonate therapy might help prevent fractures and reduce bone pain in transplant recipients, but the evidence is of low certainty. It is unclear if bisphosphonates or other treatments prevent other skeletal complications, such as spinal deformity or avascular bone necrosis. The effects of these treatments on
Four studies with 317 participants were analyzed. Three studies focused on oral magnesium doses between 12.5 and 20 mmol/day, while one study looked at injected magnesium. Each study had a high risk of bias in at least one area. There were significant differences in the methods and clinical aspects of the studies. No study met all the primary outcomes and objectives of this review. Only one study measured symptoms like seizures, delirium tremens, or parts of the CIWA score. Handgrip strength was the only outcome that could be analyzed in three studies (113 people). There was no significant improvement in handgrip strength
This text discusses a study involving 15 trials with 3057 participants, examining the effects of antibiotics on rhinosinusitis. The results show that antibiotics can slightly speed up recovery, but only a small percentage of people will benefit from this. Antibiotics also come with a higher risk of side effects compared to placebo or no treatment. The study concludes that antibiotics are not necessary for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis, considering the risks and antibiotic resistance. The study does not cover children, people with suppressed immune systems, or those with severe sinusitis, as they were not included in the available trials.
Eight studies with 2515 patients were analyzed. Three studies from Asia compared D3 and D2 lymphadenectomy, showing no significant difference in overall survival (OS) or postoperative mortality. Only one study provided disease-free survival (DFS) data, and none provided disease-specific survival (DSS) data. Five studies (3 European, 2 Asian) compared D2 and D1 lymphadenectomy, showing no significant difference in OS and DFS. However, D2 lymphadenectomy had better DSS but higher postoperative mortality compared to D1. D2 lymphadenectomy can improve DSS in stomach cancer patients, but
This review included 13 studies with 1,158 participants. When comparing naltrexone to placebo or no drug treatments, there was no significant difference in primary outcomes. The only significant result favoring naltrexone was a lower re-incarceration rate, but this was based on just two studies. When patients were forced to adhere to naltrexone, it showed better results for retention and abstinence. However, no significant difference was found when comparing naltrexone to psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, or buprenorphine. Overall, oral naltrexone did not perform better than placebo
No food modification trials met the criteria, but two fluid modification studies were included. Both were part of a large trial involving dementia and Parkinson's disease patients. The first study examined the effects of different liquid viscosities on aspiration in 351 dementia patients. The second study compared the effects of thickened liquids on pneumonia and side effects in 260 dementia patients over three months. Honey thick liquids showed better immediate results but had more adverse effects in the follow-up study. More pneumonia cases occurred with honey thick liquids than with nectar thick or regular liquids with a chin down posture. No deaths were directly related to fluid types, and quality of life
Six studies with 788 women were analyzed, with the largest trial having 396 eligible women. No significant difference was found between natural cycle and standard IVF in live birth rates, with a 34% to 53% chance of live birth using natural cycle IVF. There was also no significant difference in rates of OHSS, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, gestational abnormalities, or cycle cancellations. One trial showed a lower oocyte retrieval rate in the natural cycle group. Insufficient data was available for treatment cancellation rates and treatment costs. The evidence was limited and further research is needed to compare natural cycle IVF
This analysis included 984 participants from 12 studies focused on Tai Chi and its effects on people with COPD. The studies were divided into three comparisons: Tai Chi versus usual care, Tai Chi with breathing exercises versus breathing exercises alone, and Tai Chi with exercise versus exercise alone. Results showed that Tai Chi improved walking distance and lung function compared to usual care, but its effects on reducing breathlessness and improving quality of life were unclear. When combined with other interventions, Tai Chi did not show additional benefits. No adverse events were reported, indicating that Tai Chi is safe for people with COPD. However, the best Tai Chi style and number
This text discusses a review of 72 trials with 2470 participants, which includes 35 new studies. The trials had small sample sizes and varied interventions using virtual reality devices. Due to poor reporting, the risk of bias in many studies was unclear, resulting in mostly low-quality evidence. The primary outcome showed no significant improvement in upper limb function when comparing virtual reality to conventional therapy. However, when virtual reality was added to usual care, there was a significant difference between groups. Secondary outcomes showed no significant effects on gait speed or balance, but there was a significant improvement in daily living activities. There was not enough evidence to determine the
We found five studies (1330 participants) that fit our criteria. None of these trials looked at treatments shorter than six months. One trial (174 participants) added levofloxacin to the standard treatment, but the effects on death, sputum conversion, and side effects are unclear. Three trials (723 participants) replaced ethambutol with moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, or ofloxacin in the standard treatment. The effects on relapse, death, sputum culture conversion, and serious side effects are also unclear. One trial (433 participants) replaced isoniazid with moxif
