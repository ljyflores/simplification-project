This text discusses a study involving 38 studies and 7843 children aged 6 to 12 years old. The study found that educational interventions for children and their parents significantly reduced the risk of emergency department visits and hospital admissions. There were also fewer unscheduled doctor visits. However, there was limited data on other outcomes, such as lung function and quality of life, and no significant difference between the education and control groups. Asthma education for children and their caregivers who visit the emergency department can result in a lower risk of future emergency visits and hospital admissions. However, the long-term effects of education on other aspects of asthma, such
We analyzed 130 studies with 8341 participants, where 4588 received ketamine and 3753 served as controls. Various types of surgeries were included, such as ear, nose, throat, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion, microdiscectomy, hip and knee joint replacement, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, abdominal, radical prostatectomy, thyroid, elective caesarean section, and laparoscopic surgery. Ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events
This text discusses five trials of the MSP/RESA vaccine with 217 participants. All five trials reported on safety, and two on efficacy. No severe side effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 µg of each antigen (39 to 45 µg total). One small trial with 17 non-immune participants showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge. In the second trial with 120 children aged five to nine years in Papua New Guinea, the vaccine did not reduce episodes of clinical malaria but did reduce parasite density in children who had not been pretreated with an antimalarial drug. The
Four studies with 125 participants were included. Three studies examined the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields, and one study looked at capacitive coupled electric fields. Participants with delayed healing and non-healing of long bones were included, but most data related to non-healing of the tibia. All studies were blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled, but each had limitations. The main measure of effectiveness was the percentage of participants whose fractures healed at a fixed time. The overall effect size was small and not statistically significant. There was significant clinical and statistical variation in the analysis. A sensitivity analysis showed that the effect size remained non-significant at
A total of 1831 participants were randomly assigned to either a drain group (915 participants) or a no-drain group (916 participants) in 12 trials included in this review. Only two trials with 199 participants were considered low risk of bias. Nine trials involved patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one trial involved patients with acute cholecystitis, and one trial included both elective and emergency procedures. The average age of participants ranged between 48 and 63 years, and the proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0%. There was no significant difference in short-term mortality
This text discusses 49 trials with 3639 participants in China, testing 38 different herbal medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The trials focused on symptom improvement and nerve conduction velocity. However, the positive results from these low-quality studies are questionable. There was not enough information on adverse events, and most trials had very low methodological quality. Therefore, any positive findings should be interpreted with caution. Based on this review, there is no evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. No well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with objective outcome measures have been conducted.
This text discusses a review of five studies with 1382 patients that focused on advanced prostate cancer. The studies had small populations and were short in duration. They did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study evaluated biochemical outcomes. A subgroup analysis found no significant differences in biochemical progression between two treatment groups for various Gleason scores. For patients with a Gleason score higher than 6, one treatment group showed a reduction in biochemical progression. Studies mainly reported on adverse events, with one trial finding no difference in adverse effects between the two treatment groups, except for impotence, which was lower in one group.
We found 12 trials with moderate risk of bias involving 7,119 participants, which described random assignment. Five trials compared immediate or delayed insertion of IUDs. One trial showed immediate insertion of Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of expulsion than delayed insertion. Moderate quality evidence also suggests that use and expulsion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or CuT380A was more likely for immediate compared to delayed insertion. Another trial compared the levonorgestrel IUD to Nova T and showed higher discontinuation rates due to pregnancy for women in the Nova T group. Seven trials examined immediate insertion of
We included one small trial published as an abstract article. The study investigated the effects of meditation on patients newly hospitalized with acute leukemia. Ninety-one participants enrolled, but only 42 remained throughout the six-month follow-up period and were eligible for analysis. There was no information provided about the average age and sex of the study population. We found a high risk for attrition bias and unclear risk for reporting bias, performance, and detection bias due to missing data from the abstract publication, so we judged the overall risk of bias as high. According to the GRADE criteria, we judged the overall quality of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very
We found three trials involving 110 healthy children who were siblings of household contacts. The trials varied in quality, vaccine used, length of follow-up, and outcomes measured, making them unsuitable for meta-analysis. Two of the three studies had a high or unclear risk of bias. Overall, 13 out of 56 vaccine recipients (23%) developed varicella compared to 42 out of 54 placebo (or no vaccine) recipients (78%). Most vaccinated children who developed varicella had mild cases with fewer than 50 skin lesions. In the three trials, most participants received post-exposure treatment within three days of exposure;
We included 12 studies with 4704 participants in this review. Eleven trials compared different antibiotic regimens for preventing infections. One trial compared using antibiotics to not using them. All trials had a high risk of bias. In most cases, MRSA (a type of bacteria) was not tested or removed before surgery. There was not enough similarity between trials to combine their results. The overall death rate in four trials was 1.0%, with no significant differences between groups. No serious side effects from antibiotics were reported in any of the 561 people in four trials. None of the trials reported on quality of life, hospital
We included two trials with 116 women comparing planned home versus hospital management for PPROM. The number of women in each trial was too small for adequate assessment of pre-specified outcomes. Strict inclusion criteria were used, and few women with PPROM were eligible. Women were monitored for 48 to 72 hours before randomization. Perinatal mortality was reported in one trial, but there was insufficient evidence to determine differences between the two groups. No differences were found for serious neonatal morbidity, chorioamnionitis, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, and admission to neonatal intensive care. There was no information
The two main methods of skin closure for caesarean are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures. When comparing these methods, they have similar rates of wound infection and other secondary outcomes, such as wound complications, in women with Pfannenstiel incisions. However, the type of skin incision may affect these outcomes. Compared to absorbable sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with an increased risk of skin separation and the need for reclosure. Skin separation was defined differently across trials, and most staples were removed before four days postpartum. There is currently no conclusive evidence
We found 11 studies with 821 participants, two trials awaiting classification, and one ongoing trial. Seven trials looked at green tea treatment and four at black tea treatment. The dosage and form of both green and black tea varied between trials. The ongoing trial is studying the effects of green tea powder capsules. No studies reported cardiovascular events. Black tea was found to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and blood pressure over six months, but only a few trials contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias. Green tea also significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure, but only a few studies
Two small trials with 23 participants met the requirements for the review. Participants may have had lung disease. No data on oral steroid use were reported. No significant differences were seen in the studies for FEV1, FVC, PaO2, and symptoms. One study reported a significant difference in SGaw, but its clinical importance is uncertain. Due to concerns over small sample sizes and methodological issues, the findings are not generalizable to the topic of steroid tapering. An update search in August 2010 found no new studies for the review. Currently, there is a lack of evidence to support using azathioprine in
For this update, we found a total of 56 studies with 4068 participants for inclusion, with the majority involving breast cancer patients. A meta-analysis of all fatigue data, including 38 comparisons, provided data for 1461 participants who received an exercise intervention and 1187 control participants. At the end of the intervention period, exercise was seen to be statistically more effective than the control intervention (standardized mean difference -0.27, 95% confidence interval -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or after cancer therapy. We identified benefits of exercise on fatigue
We reviewed 1796 records and identified five eligible trials with a total of 3427 adult participants (ages 16 to 65) for our analysis. These trials were conducted in Germany, Italy, and Belgium. The overall risk of bias was low for overall survival but high for other outcomes. All trials reported results for overall survival and progression-free survival. Our updated review found that adults with early unfavorable and advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma benefit from first-line chemotherapy, including escalated BEACOPP, in terms of overall survival and progression-free survival. However, there is only low-quality evidence for a difference in the total number of secondary
We reviewed 15 studies with 1835 cancer patients and included 19 evaluations. Six studies had a high risk of bias, and nine had a low risk of bias. All studies were conducted in high-income countries, mostly focusing on breast cancer (seven trials) or prostate cancer (two trials) patients. Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions, including patient education and teaching self-care behaviors. Results showed low-quality evidence of similar return-to-work (RTW) rates for psycho-educational interventions compared to usual care and no difference in the effect on quality of life. One study offered breast cancer patients a physical training program. Low
We did not include any new trials in this update. We included four trials with over 13,000 women from the UK and Ireland. Three trials were funded by hospitals, and one was funded by the Scottish government. The studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Results from the 2012 review remain unchanged. Data showed that women who had admission CTG had a higher probability of an increase in caesarean section rates than those with intermittent auscultation. There was no clear difference in instrumental vaginal birth, perinatal mortality rate, and other secondary outcomes. Women with admission CTG had higher rates of continuous electronic fetal
We reviewed 32 studies about embryo culture media in IVF and ICSI treatments. The studies involved 3666 women, 1018 cycles, and over 15,230 oocytes. We couldn't combine the data because each study compared different culture media. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and four of them found no difference between the media compared. Six studies reported clinical pregnancy rate, with one suggesting that Quinn's Advantage led to higher rates than G5. However, this study had low-quality evidence. Regarding adverse effects, three studies reported multiple pregnancies and six reported miscarriages, but none found a difference between the
The search strategies found 2847 citations. 30 citations seemed relevant, but after removing three duplicates and six publications with the same primary data, 23 original papers remained for review. None of these met the inclusion criteria, so data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were not possible. The review question about the best way to communicate a breast cancer diagnosis to women remains unanswered due to the lack of randomized trials. The authors suggest that it might be unethical to randomize women during such a vulnerable time. Ethically sensitive research designs should be explored to inform future practice. Some papers reviewed by the authors relate to the first consultation visit where treatment
We added two new papers, one being an update of a previous study. In total, 17 RCTs with 1006 participants met the inclusion criteria, with the new study adding 113 participants. There was a significant reduction in chest pain reports in the first three months following the intervention, and this was maintained from three to nine months afterwards. There was also a significant increase in the number of chest pain-free days up to three months following the intervention, which was associated with reduced chest pain frequency. However, there was no evidence of treatment effect on chest pain frequency from three to twelve months. There was no effect on severity up
We found 30 trials with 4344 participants testing 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. Antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers were evaluated in at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT). The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). There was a large variability in reporting outcomes and study quality, but overall, the risk of bias was low. Trials only evaluated short-term effects, with treatment ranging from one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabil
Two studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, focusing on Native American populations and tobacco prevention initiatives for Indigenous youth. A total of 1505 subjects were involved. No significant difference was observed in weekly smoking at 42 months follow-up in one study. For smokeless tobacco use, no difference was found between the skills-community group and the control group at 42 weeks, but a significant difference was observed between the skills-only group and the control group. The second study found positive changes for tobacco use in the intervention group at post-test, but this was not maintained at six-month follow-up. Both studies had high or unclear risk
Out of six relevant reports found, one trial involving 72 women with sickle cell anemia met our inclusion criteria. The trial had unclear risk of bias, and the results were generally imprecise. No maternal mortality occurred in women who received either prophylactic or selective blood transfusion. Very low-quality evidence showed no clear differences in maternal mortality, perinatal mortality, or severe maternal morbidity between the treatment groups. Low-quality evidence indicated that prophylactic blood transfusion reduced the risk of pain crisis compared with selective blood transfusion. No differences were found in the occurrence of acute splenic sequestration, hemolytic
We found 67 clinical trials involving 6197 participants, all with a high risk of bias. From 64 trials with 5771 participants, we analyzed various outcomes. Most comparisons showed no significant differences, and when there were differences, they were mostly from single trials with small sample sizes. We only summarized evidence from more than one trial. One primary outcome showed a higher number of adverse events with radiofrequency dissecting sealer compared to the clamp-crush method. Some secondary outcomes showed differences in blood transfusion rates, blood loss, total hospital stay, and operating time between different methods. However, the quality of evidence was low or
This text discusses a study that included 23 trials with 724 people. The study found evidence supporting the use of systemic retinoids and oral PUVA for skin conditions. A combination of PUVA and retinoids was found to be more effective than individual treatments. Topical steroids under hydrocolloid occlusion were also found to be beneficial. Low dose ciclosporin, tetracycline antibiotics, and Grenz Ray Therapy may be useful for treating PPP, but colchicine has many side effects and its effectiveness is unclear. Topical PUVA was not found to be effective. There is no evidence to suggest that short
Nine trials examined the effectiveness of five loop diuretic drugs in lowering blood pressure for 460 people with a baseline blood pressure of 162/103 mmHg over an average of 8.8 weeks. The best estimate of blood pressure reduction was -7.9/-4.4 mmHg. There was no significant difference in withdrawals due to side effects or changes in blood tests. Additional searches in 2012 and 2014 found no new trials meeting the minimum requirements. Based on the limited number of published studies, the blood pressure-lowering effect of loop diuretics is estimated to be -8/-4 mm
We included 58 trials with 2849 participants, studying the safety and effectiveness of intraperitoneal local anesthetic instillation in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Most trials had a high risk of bias and included only low anesthetic risk patients. Bupivacaine in liquid form was the most common local anesthetic used. There were differences in the methods of anesthetic instillation, including location and timing. No deaths occurred in either group in the eight trials that reported mortality. One participant experienced serious morbidity. Pain scores were significantly lower in the local anesthetic instillation group at four to eight hours
We found 74 studies for this review and grouped them based on the antigens they detected. Types 1 to 3 include HRP-2 (from P. falciparum) alone or with other antigens. Types 4 and 5 included pLDH (from P. falciparum) alone or with other antigens. We compared these with microscopy and found varying results for each test type. In summary, both HRP-2 and pLDH-based tests can be used for diagnosing uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. HRP-2 tests may be more sensitive
Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were conducted in the UK. They tested short-term changes in consultation time allocated to each patient. Our confidence in the results was very low due to a high risk of bias, non-random allocation of participants, and lack of data on participants' characteristics and small sample sizes. We are uncertain whether changing appointment length increases primary care consultation length, number of referrals and investigations, prescriptions, or patient satisfaction based on very low-certainty evidence. None of the studies reported on the effects of altering consultation length on resources used. We did not find enough evidence to support or refute a policy of changing primary care physicians' consultation
The search found 3952 summaries of scientific articles, and three trials met the criteria for inclusion. These trials were conducted in developed countries with participants who had experience with ART and had controlled virus levels. A total of 157 participants were involved, with sample sizes ranging from 24 to 92, and over 79% were male. The studies had a high risk of biases and varied in design and results. No significant difference in virus suppression was found in the included studies. Some side effects were observed, such as increased blood lactate levels and changes in bone mineral density, limb fat, and triglyceride levels. However, no
Ten trials with 1658 participants met the criteria for this review. Five trials had low risk of bias, and five had moderate risk of bias. Six trials used recruitment maneuvers as part of an open lung ventilation strategy different from control ventilation. Six studies reported mortality outcomes. Data from five trials showed a reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, but no difference in 28-day and in-hospital mortality. There was no increased risk of barotrauma. Significant clinical differences were found in the 10 included trials. Results are based on five trials using an "open lung ventilation strategy," making interpretation of the results difficult.
This text discusses a review of 15 studies with 687 participants that examined the role of psychological interventions in treating asthma. The quality of these studies was generally poor, and their sample sizes were often small. Some effects were analyzed, but the results were mixed and not always significant. Relaxation therapy was found to reduce the use of "as needed" medications in two studies with 47 patients. However, there was no significant difference in lung function (FEV1) for relaxation therapy in four studies with 150 patients. Quality of life, measured using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, showed a positive effect following Cognitive Behavioral
This review included 35 studies with 6785 participants, focusing on the comparison between antidepressants and benzodiazepines for treating panic disorder. The evidence found was of low quality, suggesting no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of response rate. However, very low-quality evidence suggested that benzodiazepines might be better tolerated than antidepressants in some cases. The majority of the studies had limitations, such as small sample sizes and lack of detailed information on methods. Therefore, the results of this review should be considered with caution. Clinicians should assess the potential role of antidepressants and benzodiazepines on an
This text discusses 29 trials with over 1,700 participants who have pancreatic cancer. Three studies compared plastic stents to surgery for treating the cancer. Using plastic stents had fewer complications but a higher risk of bile duct blockage before death compared to surgery. There was also a trend towards lower risk of death within 30 days with plastic stents. One study compared metal stents to surgery and found lower costs and better quality of life with metal stents. Nine studies compared metal to plastic stents, and metal stents had a lower risk of bile duct blockage. There was no significant difference in the risk of technical failure
We included five studies with 444 arterial cannulations in children. Four studies compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. Risk of bias varied across studies, with some lacking details of allocation concealment. It was not possible to blind practitioners in all studies, adding a performance bias. Only two studies reported the rate of complications. Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound guidance has a higher success rate at the first attempt (risk ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters, four studies, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications, such
We included one small RCT with 80 male students in the Netherlands, published in 2009, and three ITS studies from the 1970s and 80s in Canadian provinces. The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with low-alcohol content drank less than those exposed to high-alcohol content movies. Young men exposed to neutral commercials drank less compared to those exposed to alcohol commercials. Outcomes were assessed immediately after the intervention, so no follow-up data were available. The quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to bias, indirectness, and imprecision. Three ITS studies evaluated different types of advertising
This text discusses a study that included eight randomized trials with a total of 182 infants. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of high and low MCT formulas on infants' short-term growth, gastrointestinal tolerance, and incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis. The results showed no significant differences between the two formula types in terms of growth, tolerance, or enterocolitis. The study concluded that neither formula type could be proven to improve short-term growth or have fewer adverse effects. However, the results are imprecise due to small sample sizes and do not address important long-term outcomes. Further research is needed to clarify the effects on formula
