  1. No evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism to the segmental level.  2. New groundglass airspace opacities in all 5 lobes, right greater than left, likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.  3. Spiculated right upper lobe mass redemonstrated.  4. Splenomegaly.  Reported And Signed By: Feng Jiang, MD
 1. Improved right upper lobe primary lung lesion.  2. Marked improvement in bibasilar atelectasis, other findings in the chest are stable.  3. Increased sclerosis of several metastatic lesions likely related to interval treatment. A pathologic fracture of the L4 vertebral body has mildly progressed.  4. Stable splenomegaly. One of the hypodensities seen previously appears smaller which could be related to a partially filled in cavernous hemangioma.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging
IMPRESSION:  7 mm long axis nodule at right lower lobe previously measured 6 mm. This apparent small difference in size could be due to slightly thicker section thickness of 3 mm on the prior examination or could be due to slight interval growth. Because of the possibility of slight interval growth, interval chest CT follow-up in 6-12 months is suggested.  Other lung nodules are unchanged.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. No aortic dissection, intramural hematoma or aneurysm.  2. Question slight thickening of the colonic wall from the ascending to the descending colon, which may in part be due to underdistention. However in the appropriate clinical circumstances early colitis can have a similar appearance. In addition Focal area of narrowing in the sigmoid is noted for which correlation with screening colonoscopy is recommended to exclude malignancy.  3. Gallbladder distention with mild wall enhancement, for which clinical correlation and as needed follow-up ultrasound may be considered to exclude acute cholecystitis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of a pulmonary embolism or other acute pulmonary process.   Slightly more prominent mediastinal adenopathy.  Worsening gynecomastia for which dedicated mammographic evaluation may be considered.  Non-specific 4-6 mm lung nodules.  If this patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, a follow-up chest CT scan in 6-12 months is recommended.  In the absence of a history of smoking or other risk factor, a follow-up chest CT scan is recommended in 1 year.  If there is a history of malignancy, a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months or as per oncology protocol.   Reported And Signed By: Jamal Bokhari, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.  Limited examination without evidence of central pulmonary embolism. 2.  Left sided lung nodules measuring up to 6 mm in the left upper lobe. These were not definitively visualized on the prior examination. As per updated Fleischner Society criteria, if the patient is low risk for malignancy, no additional follow-up is necessary. However, if the patient is high risk, a follow-up CT scan obtained in 6-12 months.  Reported By:  Tekchand Ramchand, MD  Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD

IMPRESSION: Continued interval enlargement of two mixed attenuation right lower lobe nodules since November 2019, as above, likely separate primary lesions along the adenocarcinoma spectrum. Other groundglass nodules are unchanged.     Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD
IMPRESSION:  Stable postsurgical changes of the lungs bilaterally. Multiple groundglass and part solid nodules, some of which have slightly increased in size going back to studies from 2018. These nodules likely represent adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions and should be followed closely on future imaging.  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD
IMPRESSION:  Worsening parenchymal disease with patchy distribution of moderate to severe peripheral honeycombing greatest at the bases with heterogeneous distribution with associated traction bronchiectasis. Worsening honeycombing is consistent with pulmonary fibrosis with the pattern most consistent with worsening UIP. This prominent fibrosis could be related to connective tissue disorder given the dilated esophagus.  There also is probable emphysema which also appears worse than on the prior examination.  Mild enlargement of central pulmonary arteries without change likely represents pulmonary artery hypertension.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD
Impression: Changes of fibrotic interstitial lung disease which are likely a manifestation of UIP although that diagnosis cannot be made with certainty given the absence of satisfactory expiratory images. Fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis would be another possibility. There has been no progression of changes since the prior nor is there is superimposed inflammation. There are also changes of emphysema in the upper lobes.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with metastatic cancer including large heterogeneous mass in right hilum and mediastinum occluding right upper lobe bronchus and right upper lobe pulmonary artery segmental branch and narrowing the vena cava. This also partially encases and likely invades the right pulmonary artery. Additional mediastinal metastases are seen and enlarged lymph nodes are seen in right supraclavicular region. Enlarged right adrenal measuring up to 2.6 cm is suspicious for metastatic disease. There is po*  2 cm mass seen in right breast corresponding with known cancer. 2 cm right axillary lymph node is again seen.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD
Impression:  Marked interval improvement in metastatic disease, as described above.   Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD
IMPRESSION:   No pulmonary embolism.  More consolidative appearing nonspecific peripheral opacity in the right upper lobe abutting the major fissure, in the area of a previous subtle groundglass opacity; a finding that are nonspecific, but given the patient's history and clinical picture this may be related to an inflammatory etiology or traumatic reaction, and less likely an infectious process. Follow-up may be considered to evaluate resolution status posttreatment, given the patient's history of malignancy.  Findings were discussed with Dr. Taylor at the time of dictation.

IMPRESSION:  Widely metastatic disease throughout the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as described above.  The critical findings above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as an Orange critical result.  Reported By:  Ezra Detroy, MD  Reported And Signed By: Philip Dinauer, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Masslike 4 cm consolidation with surrounding groundglass opacity within the right lower lobe corresponds to the abnormality seen on the recent chest radiograph. There are several other smaller foci of nodules and nodular consolidation with surrounding groundglass opacity. This suggests that all these findings are likely infectious in etiology. Bacterial and fungal pneumonia should be considered, the latter if the patient is immunosuppressed. Septic emboli are vasculitides could have a similar imaging appearance but is considered to be far less likely. Given the patient's emphysema, resolution of these opacities should be documented within 2-3 months time with a noncontrast chest CT. Interval monitoring may be performed with chest radiographs.  2. Solid noncalcified 5 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Given the patient's emphysema, the presumption is made of a smoking history. Follow up is recommended in 6-12 months time towards documenting a total of 2-year stability as per the Fleischner society criteria.    3.

An endobronchial lesion cannot be excluded given the history of malignancy and a follow-up CT should be obtained to exclude one. 3. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions. Small to moderate pericardial effusion.  Reported By:  Kaitlin Eng, MD  Reported And Signed By: Paul Anthony Cedeno, MD 
IMPRESSION: The tip of the right chest tube terminates at the right apex, while there is a persistent loculated right subpulmonic pleural effusion. There are nodular pleural hypodensities in the right lung base. It is difficult to differentiate the previously identified nodular pleural metastases versus interval development of loculated blood clots in setting of recently administered tPA. Please correlate clinically for hemorrhagic drainage through chest tube.  Interval slight increase in the moderate size left pleural effusion.  Persistent near complete consolidation of the right lung with interval worsening of the right apical aeration, likely secondary to combination of lung mass and superimposed pneumonia/atelectasis.  Interval increase in size of the left lung nodules and mediastinal/pericardiac lymphadenopathy.  Reported By:  Nariman Nezami, MD  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD 
Impression: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions and groundglass opacities could be related to fluid overload. It would be difficult to rule out an element of ARDS, given the nondependent distribution of some of the groundglass opacities.   2.

For example, the left lower lobe contains a new nodule on image 40 of series 2, and several new nodules in the same area on image 43 of series 2. A left upper lobe nodule on image 50 of series 2 appears stable. The right upper lobe contains a pleural nodule on image 20 of series 2 that is slightly increased in size.  A subcentimeter right middle lobe nodule on image 49 of series 2 appears slightly smaller.  The right lung apex demonstrates an increase in nodular pleural thickening which may represent fluid, with associated bronchiectatic changes or scarring.  A precarinal lymph node which previously measured 9 mm appears minimally enlarged, now measuring 1 cm (image 23 of series 2.) No pleural or pericardial effusion is identified.  Abdomen and pelvis: The left adrenal gland contains a 1.7 cm nodule which was not seen previously (image 62 of series 2).

IMPRESSION:   1.  Progression of the metastatic disease with new nodules in the left lung and increasing pleural effusions. 2.  Increasing lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum. 3.  Increase in size of metastatic lesion to the right adrenal gland with enlargement also of the left adrenal gland. 4.  The right lower lobe mass is difficult to evaluate because it has increased and it is not clear if this is due to a superimposed infection of progression of the mass itself. 5.

Impression:      1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolus until level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries 2. The patient's large subcarinal mass appears to have undergone slight, but real interval increase in size despite the very short interval between imaging. This mass exerts significant mass effect upon the right main pulmonary artery and upon the left atrium, specifically on the inferior pulmonary veins, which may be contributory to the patient's symptomology. While there is no evidence of pulmonary edema at this time, the degree of compression of the pulmonary veins suggests that this could be occurring in the near future.

Impression:  1. Fluid-filled distention of the stomach and esophagus to the level of the gastric outlet with suggestion of wall thickening in the region of the gastric antrum, raising concern for serosal disease causing gastric obstruction. Of note, the degree of fluid distention of the esophagus likely predisposes the patient to aspiration.  2. Air-fluid collections containing minimal fluid in the anterior abdomen closely approximated to bowel loops at the site of prior carcinomatosis, concerning for contained bowel perforation of the transverse colon, and likely of a loop of small bowel. A CT with oral contrast can be considered for further evaluation of these findings.  3. Moderate to large left and moderate right pleural effusions, increased since prior.

IMPRESSION: Stable interstitial lung disease.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Small density peripherally in the right upper lobe, of uncertain significance. If the patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, noncontrast CT chest follow-up in one year is suggested, based on Fleischner Society guidelines.  2. No evidence of a neoplastic process in the abdomen or pelvis.  3. Further progression of severe arthritic changes at the right hip most likely representing a rapidly advancing osteoarthritis although chronic infection cannot be excluded.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD
Impression:  1. No aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, or aneurysm. 2. Normal origins of the coronary arteries, without appreciable dissection in the proximal right and left coronary arteries.

Interval slight increase in size of irregular/spiculated density in the right upper lobe, as described above.  Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, with slight increase in size of the subcarinal and right suprahilar lymph nodes.  These findings could be due to an inflammatory/infectious process superimposed on patient's known underlying chronic interstitial lung disease. However, neoplastic process cannot be excluded, especially the new spiculated density in the left upper lobe is very concerning, given the history of chronic interstitial lung disease and emphysema and history of cancer.  Reported And Signed By: Priyanka Deb, MD
Impression: 1. Minimal quality CT PE with multiple streak artifacts partly related to patient's inability to raise his right arm. And to low injection rate. There is no evidence of filling defects to the segmental arteries. Decreased opacity as described in one of the segmental arteries to the left lower lobe I think is artifact. If the suspicion of pulmonary embolism a strong suggest repeat examination in 24 hours with larger IV. 2. In view of history of cephalic vein clot in January there is inadequate contrast in the subclavian vein to evaluate for thrombus. Contrast was injected from the left side. 3. Coronary artery calcification. 4. Compression fracture of sclerotic T5. This was not present on radiograph of 3/2009. Sclerosis raises the possibility of metastatic disease. The sclerotic lesion in the right 10th rib is associated with a fracture.  The findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Red critical result.

IMPRESSION:  Mid to lower lung predominant subpleural reticulation, traction bronchiectasis and architectural distortion with diffuse air trapping. There is mild associated centrilobular emphysema. The imaging findings are inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and have some imaging features suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP).  Air trapping signifies small airways disease which may be related to underlying COPD or post-infectious/inflammatory constrictive bronchiolitis.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.  Stable findings of fibrotic lung disease compared to 5/29/2015. New region of nonspecific groundglass in the lingula likely infectious or inflammatory. Presence of air trapping all 5 lobes would make this inconsistent with UIP based on ATS/ERS criteria and raise the possibility of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. However, if air-trapping not related to chronic hypersensitivity and thought to be related to other causes of obliterative small airways disease, the pattern is consistent with possible UIP. Presence of moderate size hiatal hernia may be contributory to the lung disease.  2.  Upper lobe centrilobular emphysema   Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Killam, MD

Reported And Signed By: Jay Pahade, MD
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in multifocal bilateral centrilobular nodules with small areas of ""tree-in-bud" opacity noted in the right middle lobe and lingula. These may represent chronic sequela of prior infectious/inflammatory process; however, an acute small airways infection could have a similar appearance. Recommend correlation with patient's symptoms.  Reported By:  Marianne Reed, MD  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
Impression:   Once again there is mild bronchiectasis but there is progression of multiple areas of tree in bud appearance with mucous plugging and some areas of groundglass attenuation.

Impression:  1. No evidence of a pulmonary embolism.  2. Diffuse nonspecific groundglass opacities in a predominantly perihilar distribution, for which correlation with patient's volume status is recommended to evaluate for pulmonary edema in the setting of cardiomegaly.   3. More confluent groundglass consolidation in the right upper, right lower, and left upper lobes, which in the appropriate clinical setting, may represent pneumonia, with likely reactive mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. Radiographic follow-up is recommended upon the completion of appropriate medical therapy to evaluate for resolution.  Reported And Signed By: Michael Rolen, MD 
IMPRESSION:  Patchy groundglass parenchymal disease with mosaic pattern with the groundglass disease predominantly located centrally with changed configuration although similar extent to prior CT from June 2015. Previously seen areas of consolidation have resolved, however there is a new small 8 mm rounded area of consolidation right upper lobe. Mild peripheral reticular interstitial disease with intralobular septal thickening is seen and there is multichamber cardiac enlargement. These findings most likely represent congestive heart failure with interstitial edema. The 8 mm rounded area of consolidation could be amenable to interval CT follow-up.  There is moderate proximal wall thickening throughout both lungs slightly more severe than on prior examination. There are areas of distal mucous plugging in some  bronchi.   small 4 mm left pleural effusion.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD 
Impression:  1. Status post hysterectomy. Moderate infiltration of the pelvic and retroperitoneal fat may be postoperative in nature but I cannot exclude tumor infiltration, and followup imaging will be necessary to further assess this abnormality. 2. Ovoid structure along the left pelvic sidewall may represent a postoperative hematoma but again, followup imaging will be helpful. 3. Mild left hydronephrosis which can also be followed by CT but shorter-term interval followup with renal ultrasound may be considered.

IMPRESSION:  Interval development of dilation of small bowel loops up to 3.7 cm containing air-fluid levels in the abdomen with no transition point visualized. These loops do not containing contrast with more proximal bowel content oral contrast not appearing dilated. It is uncertain if this is due to ileus, small bowel obstruction, or due to the large amount of stool throughout the colon causing relative obstruction of the distal small bowel.  Anasarca is seen throughout the visualized fat.  Small right pleural effusion is again seen.  3 mm nodule seen in left upper lobe that was not visible on prior examination from November 2013 however the prior examination was obtained with 5 mm sections represent 2.5 mm sections on the current examination which could account for the nonvisualization previously. This could be amenable to continued follow-up if clinically indicated.  Thick walled fluid collection in left pelvis at pelvic sidewall measuring up to 4.9 cm is unchanged.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. Scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules along with a few small regions of focal parenchymal change may be related to nonspecific infection/inflammation.  2.

Impression: 1. Several findings which are suspicious for fungal disease including a 1.2 cm peripheral nodule in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe and several smaller nodules in the upper lobes bilaterally including one which has surrounding groundglass opacity. This latter nodule suggests the possibility of invasive aspergillosis. 2. Relatively stable appearance of consolidation in the right lower lobe compared with the examination of less than one month previously. 3. Small pericardial effusion, decreased in size from the prior.  The critical findings above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as an Orange critical result.   Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
Impression: 1.

As a result, the apparent increased narrowing of both mainstem bronchi is likely technical in nature and not related to worsening tumor burden. Ground glass opacity throughout the right lung is less likely related to expiratory technique rather than representing a true new abnormality. Overall, tumor burden is felt to be similar given these technical differences.  Reported And Signed By: Kenneth Baker, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, largest measuring 4 mm in the right upper lobe, may be infectious or inflammatory. According to the 2017 Fleischner Society criteria for incidentally found pulmonary nodules of this size and appearance, in a low risk patient (minimal or no smoking or other known risk factors for malignancy), no follow-up is needed, while in a high risk patient (history of smoking or other known risk factors), consider optional CT follow-up at 12 months. If the patient has known malignancy: follow up according to oncology protocol. 3. Diffusely thickened and patulous thoracic esophagus.

IMPRESSION:  1. New large loculated left pleural effusion with consequent collapse of the left lower lobe and significant rightward mediastinal shift. Enhancing nodularity along the left posterior and mediastinal pleura is highly suspicious for malignant involvement. This can be confirmed with thoracocentesis, as clinically warranted.  2. Status post resection of the previously demonstrated right chest wall mass with posterior chest wall reconstruction. New groundglass opacities in the right lung are nonspecific but could represent postradiation pneumonitis and/or a superimposed infectious process.   The critical findings described above were communicated verbally and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result to Dr Varga at 950pm on 3/3/14.

  New sclerotic osseous metastases as described above.  Solid left upper lobe pulmonary nodule measuring up to 1.4 cm, indeterminate but given the background of emphysema this can be concerning for malignancy. Further evaluation with PET/CT or short-term follow-up with chest CT in 3 months should be obtained for further evaluation.  Scattered foci of tree-in-bud nodular opacities in the bilateral lungs, likely infection/inflammation of small airways.  Additional solid pulmonary nodules such as 6 mm nodule in the right lower lobe are not seen on prior study, indeterminate. Should be followed up on subsequent imaging study according to the patient's protocol.  Reported And Signed By: Babina Gosangi, MD

IMPRESSION: Increased posterior and inferior density to the region of radiation fibrosis in the paramediastinal left lung, particularly in the left lower lobe. This is of indeterminant etiology and may be related to an ongoing infection. However, this may also reflect lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the setting of tumor recurrence. If the patient has recurrent symptoms of infection, a repeat contrast-enhanced chest CT is recommended in no more than 2 months to document resolution. If there is no clear symptomatology of infection, then a PET/CT is recommended at this time.  The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result.      Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD 
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pulmonary embolism.  Increased airspace opacities in the left apex, concerning for a developing infiltrate.  Increased air filled cavity in the left apex adjacent to the suture material, which could be related to a bronchopleural fistula, but an infectious process is not excluded.  Reported And Signed By: Margarita Revzin, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Postsurgical and postradiation changes involving the left upper lobe/superior segment left lower lobe. Cavitation again present within this region that appears to extend to the pleural space likely due to bronchopleural fistula, and there is associated chest wall extension posteriorly as well. Findings compatible with infection/inflammation and/or tumor extension in the left upper lobe more superiorly are improving however. 2. New enlargement and irregularity of the posterior aortic arch/proximal descending thoracic aorta with ulcer-like projections/pseudoaneurysm formation likely secondary to involvement by adjacent infection and/or tumor. Further evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography is suggested to exclude possibility of an aorto-pulmonary/aorto-pleural fistula. 3. No significant change in lung nodules and lymphadenopathy likely due to metastatic involvement. Indeterminate spiculated right middle lobe nodule is also unchanged. 4. Stable irregularity and heterogeneity of the left third through sixth ribs likely related to prior radiation and/or chest wall invasion, but with new small lytic lesion in the left sixth posterior rib.  The critical findings described above were communicated verbally to Janine Defrank and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.

IMPRESSION:   1. Cavitating mass in the anterior segment of the right lower lobe with spiculated margins which is very worrisome for neoplastic process. Similar opacity is present at the right lung base associated with bronchiectasis and air bronchograms with smaller similar opacities in the left upper lobe and right upper lobe. In addition there are multiple small nodules some in a tree-in-bud distribution. The esophagus is massively dilated to the level of the vocal cords without air-fluid level. There is no apparent mass distally but no contrast is given. Putting all of this together most likely this is achalasia with chronic aspiration. This would account for all the findings. Less likely would be a neoplastic process in the lungs and tree in bud nodules always suggest infectious disease for which tuberculosis is a consideration.  Findings discussed with Dr. Baldeo at the time of dictation. Additional history is that the patient does not appear to be chronically or critically ill. He stopped smoking in the early 21st century.

Impression: 1. Stable appearance of 2 tiny nodules adjacent to one another in the right lower lobe. Given the relative clustering, this may be a manifestation of infection/inflammatory process. 2. Groundglass opacity in the medial segment of the right middle lobe containing several nodules within. As per above, these nodules almost certainly are manifestation of infection/inflammation. 3. Less than 0.3 cm nodule located anteriorly in the right upper lobe.  Comment: Several small nodules are identified, tube which are stable from the prior exam, and several others which were not imaged on the prior exam. None measures more than 0.4 cm and given the relative clustering in the right lower lobe of the tube which were initially seen, it is most likely that they are all infectious/inflammatory. The stability over this relatively short interval is reassuring. It is likely that no further follow-up is required.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. All pulmonary nodules are stable from 2009 and are benign. See recommendations below  2. Interval resolution of previous infectious bronchiolitis from the prior CT.

Interval increase in size of the descending thoracic aorta aneurysm measuring up to 61 x 59 mm (previously 40 x 37 mm). No acute aortic pathology or mediastinal hematoma. No active extraluminal extravasation of intravenous contrast. Partially patent partially imaged graft off the left subclavian artery.  2. Nodular areas of consolidation in the superior segment of the left lower lobe, immediately posterior to the descending thoracic aorta stent graft, and peripheral groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe have worsened since prior exams but are similar in appearance to the left lower lobe nodular consolidation seen on the CT from December 2011. These opacities may be due to an infectious or inflammatory process and may represent the source of patient's hemoptysis. Follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months to assess for interval resolution and exclude potential underlying solid lesion.  3. Patchy central groundglass opacities in the right middle lobe, lingula, and bilateral lower lobes likely represent aspirated blood in this patient with hemoptysis although infection should be included in the differential diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting.  4. Mildly enlarged mediastinal or left hilar nodes are likely reactive and are amenable to follow-up on the above recommended chest CT.  5.

Findings compatible with small airway infection in the left lower lobe with increased bronchial wall thickening and small amount of fluid within some of the dilated airways likely due to superinfection. Given the distribution of bronchiectasis, would consider possible etiologies such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), dysmotile cilia syndrome, less likely cystic fibrosis (CF) variant.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.Slight interval increase in size of a nodule located in the right middle lobe, now measuring closer to 0.8 cm as compared with 0.6 cm previously.  2.Status post left upper lobectomy, extensive bronchiectasis throughout the remainder of the left lung with some fluid filling the dilated bronchioles as well as bronchiectasis in the right middle lobe.

IMPRESSION: 1. There is a 0.8 cm groundglass opacity in the right upper lobe which is stable since the prior study from 11/18/2015 but new since 12/3/2013. This is amenable to follow-up on routine examination. Many of the other pulmonary nodules are stable and likely benign. 2. Cystic bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe with air-fluid level in the tracheobronchial tree and centrilobular groundglass opacities. These findings were present on the prior study and likely represent chronic infection/inflammation.  Reported By:  Dennis Toy, MD  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Severe chronic bilateral lower lung bronchiectasis, most extensive in the left lower lobe, is likely related to chronic/recurrent infection and/or aspiration. Interval increase in mucoid impaction within the left lower lobe dilated airways. 2. Interval increase in size of several scattered solid more discrete left lower lobe nodules and two new 4 mm right upper lobe nodules. Given worsening mucoid impaction in the left lower lobe, these nodules may be infectious in etiology but in the setting of prior lung cancer, malignancy cannot be excluded. Therefore, follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months or according to patient's oncology protocol. 3. Enlarging left hilar lymphadenopathy may be reactive to the worsening airway mucoid impaction but should be reassessed on the above recommended follow-up chest CT to document improvement/resolution. Enlarging gastrohepatic lymph node is also nonspecific and should be reassessed on follow-up examination as well. 4. Indeterminate 1 cm right upper lobe groundglass nodule, which has increased in size when compared to older CT from 2013; interval growth raises concern for a slow-growing synchronous primary lung malignancy. Recommend continued follow-up. 5. Indeterminate 1 cm left thyroid nodule, for which correlation with nonemergent neck ultrasound is recommended. 6. Other stable chronic findings, as detailed in the report.  Reported By:  Ali Mian, MD  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva

IMPRESSION:  1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.  Patchy bilateral airspace opacities are likely infectious/inflammatory in nature.    Report Initiated By:  Suzanne Czerniak, MD  Reported And Signed By: Susan Marlatt, MD
Impression: 1. Extensive fibrotic interstitial lung disease again seen likely due to fibrotic NSIP, stable to slightly increased compared with the prior most recent prior CT but has progressed from older prior exams. 2. Areas of consolidation on the prior CT have resolved however there are new ill-defined nodular densities and areas of consolidation along bronchovascular bundles with possible differential etiologies as detailed above. Please correlate with clinical parameters and consider further evaluation (such as with bronchoscopy) as clinically warranted. 3. Worsening intrathoracic lymphadenopathy which is nonspecific, possibly reactive related to patient's parenchymal disease however given the splenomegaly, would consider consider histologic sampling as clinically warranted to exclude other etiologies (such as lymphoproliferative disorder/lymphoma or possibly sarcoidosis).   The critical findings above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as an Orange critical result.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
Impression:  1. No evidence of a pulmonary embolism. 2. No evidence of metastatic disease and otherwise unremarkable examination.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. New left upper lobe consolidation at site of prior neoplasm, architectural distortion, small loculated left pleural effusion and volume loss are consistent with interval radiation.  A discrete measurable lesion is not well-seen but likely decreased in size from prior study. 2. New groundglass opacity in the anterior left upper lobe may represent infectious or inflammatory process. 3.  Severe emphysema. 4.  Aneurysmal thoracic aorta as described.  Reported By:  Sarah Steenbergen, MD  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION:  Essentially stable radiation changes within the left upper lobe with the exception of a slightly enlarged nodule within the radiation field. This nodule is likely related to radiation change and is amenable to follow-up.  Reported By:  Michael Kelleher, MD  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
Impression: 1. In the setting of marked centrilobular emphysema, there has been a decrease in size of a lesion in the left upper lobe which previously had demonstrated a sharply defined curvilinear border compatible with the changes expected following the stereotactic body radiation therapy. Again, however, it is unclear how much of this represents radiation induced change and how much represents a malignancy of bowel. No remote nodules identified with the exception of a benign appearing nodule in the right lower lobe. This nodule has remained stable over the course of multiple prior examination.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.Fairly significant increase in size of triangular opacity in the left upper lobe extending to the pleural surface with surrounding groundglass opacity when compared with the most recent prior examination, at which time this same opacity had decreased in size from the examination prior to it. Without knowing the exact temporal relationship of this scan with respect to the administration of radiation therapy, it is not possible to determine the significance. Given that the shape has not changed and that there are no additional nodules elsewhere nor is there evidence of adenopathy, it seems more likely that this change in size over the course of the examinations is related to radiation therapy and not to an increase in malignancy. Unfortunately, it is likely that there is no imaging modality that would allow for this distinction.  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.Increasing apparent size of the lesion which for which radiation treatment had been completed 2 years previously. As previously described, it is difficult to determine how much of the opacity and adjacent consolidation represents lesion and how much represents a treatment induced response.

IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of fibrotic interstitial lung disease. Possible mild air-trapping the lower lobes suggesting underlying small airway disease. 2. Nonspecific pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm. Indeterminate nodule These nodules are nonspecific and may be post infectious or inflammatory in etiology but in the absence of prior chest CT examinations to assess long term stability these nodules remain indeterminate and should be followed according to the Fleischner Society guidelines. Follow-up recommendations according to the Fleischner Society for incidentally found pulmonary nodules measuring <6 mm: low Risk Patient (Minimal or no smoking or other known risk factors for malignancy): No routine follow-up recommended; high Risk Patient (History of smoking or other known risk factors): Optional follow-up chest CT at 12 months; if unchanged, no further follow-up. If the patient has known malignancy followup is recommended in 2-3 months or according to patient's oncology protocol. 3. Coronary artery disease. Ectatic ascending aorta measuring up to 3.8 cm. 4. Hepatic steatosis.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva 
IMPRESSION: Smaller the 6 mm lung nodules are stable from prior chest CT (1 year stability) and are therefore considered benign (postinfectious or postinflammatory) according to the current Fleischner Society guidelines; no routine follow-up is recommended.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD
 No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. Air trapping at the bases likely physiologic. a hyperdense focus at the liver capsule posterolaterally measuring approximately 17 x 7 mm, likely present on prior exam but enlarged. Liver MR is recommended for further evaluation, particularly given cirrhotic morphology and hepatic steatosis.  Reported And Signed By: Anna Bader, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging
Impression:  Growing nodule in the right lower lobe. The possibility of a primary lung malignancy should be considered.  The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result  Reported And Signed By: Gary Israel, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple nonspecific lung nodules, some of which are calcified consistent with granulomas and some of which are stable dating back to 2008 compatible with benign etiology. Other nonspecific nodules are stable and some have decreased in size compared with the most recent prior CT, suggesting benign (possibly infectious/postinflammatory) etiology as well. If clinically warranted, a follow-up chest CT could be performed (in one year) to further assess. 2. Mild bronchiectasis and few scattered areas of mucus plugging.  The critical findings described above were communicated verbally to Dr. G. Michaud and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.

IMPRESSION: 1. Ascending aortic aneurysm at the level of the sinus of Valsalva (43 mm x 42 mm x 40 mm), please noted measurements are less accurate at this level due to artifact.  2. Enlargement of the pulmonary artery (50 mm x 47 mm) which can be seen in the setting of pulmonary hypertension.  Reported By:  Alison Sheridan, MD  Reported And Signed By: Steffen Huber, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple nonspecific lung nodules, some of which are of ground glass density. In addition, there is an approximately 1.5 cm irregular density at the medial left base which has enlarged and become more elongated compared with 6/2015 abdominal CT. This may simply reflect a focus of scarring however a primary lung neoplasm could have a similar appearance and is not excluded. Follow-up chest CT is recommended (in 3-6 months) for further evaluation. 2. Mild bronchiectasis. No evidence of fibrotic interstitial lung disease. 3. Dilated esophagus filled with debris compatible with history of scleroderma. 4. Small pericardial effusion.  Calcific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Further evaluation with mammography and possibly breast ultrasound is recommended.   The critical findings described above were communicated verbally to Kristen Papu and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Bronchiectasis at both bases, greater on the right than the left. I suspect most likely this is on the basis of aspiration given the large amount of retained material in the esophagus. No fibrosis to suggest scleroderma. 2. The abnormal opacity at the left lung base posterior O medially I think represents consolidation rather than a distinct solid nodule as there is associated bronchiectasis best appreciated on coronal and sagittal views. These findings were present on abdominal CT of 12/25/2016. Suggest 1 year follow-up of CT high res without contrast. 3. Stable small 4 mm and less solid as well as single groundglass nodule.  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable bilateral lung nodules and mild lower lobe bronchiectasis. No evidence of diffuse interstitial changes.  2.

 There is decreased burden of pulmonary emboli in comparison to CTA of the chest dated 4/24/2021. Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli are again seen within the bilateral lower lobes. The RV/LV ratio is again greater than 1. There is a new consolidation within the right lower lobe, which likely represents a pulmonary infarct or less likely infectious process.   New right moderate size pleural effusion. Stable small left pleural effusion.    Multiple stable sub-6 mm pulmonary lung nodules, however evaluation is limited due to motion artifact.

IMPRESSION:  1.At least 4 cm mass obstructing the right lower lobe bronchus, with right lower lobe collapse associated. While the mass is not significantly changed in size when compared to the PET/CT of April 2015, the complete collapse of the right lower lobe is new in the present study 2.Enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, with the largest nodes in the subcarinal station difficult to measure because of contiguity with the original tumor mass  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD 
IMPRESSION: Significant decrease in size of the centrally located right infrahilar neoplasm with improvement of airway obstruction and reexpansion of the right lower lobe as detailed above. Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is also improving.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD 
Impression: Unchanged basilar predominant subpleural reticulation with evidence of geographic air trapping. These findings may reflect nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), particularly in the setting of a remote drug reaction or history of underlying collagen vascular disease. The air trapping may be related to this in etiology or represent a separate small airways process such as sequela of postviral constrictive bronchiolitis, asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, though the latter is not suspected given the lack of centrilobular nodules.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
Impression:  1. Moderate progression of peripheral interstitial lung disease with a pattern consistent with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia 2. Increase in the size of what is thought to be a cyst in the upper pole right kidney. As CT numbers are greater than water, repeat ultrasound is suggested.  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick, MD

IMPRESSION:  1. A small to moderate right and a small left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. There is right-sided pleural thickening suggestive of right exudative effusion. Volume loss and architectural distortion in the right lung may suggest chronicity.  2. Mild pulmonary edema is present.  3. Right lung bronchial wall thickening and dilation may reflect an infectious/inflammatory bronchiolitis.  4. No radiographic evidence of an underlying intrathoracic malignancy though evaluation the basilar bilateral lower lobes is limited by atelectasis.  5. Enlargement of the central pulmonary may reflect underlying pulmonary hypertension.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD

Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
Impression: 1. Few scattered tiny solid nodules demonstrate long-term stability and are therefore radiographically compatible with benign/postinflammatory etiology. 2. Upper lobe predominant centrilobular groundglass nodules and patchy/subpleural areas of groundglass opacities in the lower lobes with an appearance most suggestive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis--please correlate with medication and exposure history. 3. Main pulmonary artery remains enlarged, correlate clinically to exclude possibility of pulmonary hypertension.   Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is evidence of pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions as well as superimposed multilobar pneumonia. Enlargement of the cardiopericardial silhouette with signs of pulmonary hypertension  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse upper lobe predominant centrilobular groundglass nodules are redemonstrated, with less conspicuous findings of heterogeneity of attenuation of the lung parenchyma in the lower lobes. Differential considerations include Respiratory Bronchiolitis-ILD (given the patient's history of smoking) versus hypersensitivity pneumonitis. RB-ILD is favored, given the decreased conspicuity of heterogeneity of the attenuation of the lung parenchyma. It is presumed that the clinical history was elicited. Previously, but since hypersensitivity pneumonitis remains in the differential diagnosis, recommend obtaining a complete history regarding exposures. 2. Interval resolution of patchy areas consolidation and pleural effusions since the most recent prior chest CT.  Reported By:  Samira Rathnayake, MD  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION: Combination of patchy groundglass opacity, airspace consolidation and ill-defined nodular opacities noted throughout the lungs. Given the patient's symptomatology and obtain status, the findings compatible with likely polymicrobial infection. Viral and fungal etiologies should be considered. No cavitary lesions or intrapulmonary abscess noted.  Small left pleural effusion with segmental left lower lobe atelectasis. While there are no specific imaging features to suggest a left empyema, this cannot be excluded by imaging.     Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.Interval resolution of widespread areas of groundglass, solid and semisolid solid nodularity compared to prior study  2.New discrete 1.2 cm groundglass nodule in the left upper lobe.

Trace pericardial effusion.  1 cm hyperdense lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 62 Hounsfield units in attenuation, indeterminate in etiology on this noncontrast CT exam. Further evaluation with dedicated renal mass CT or MRI with IV contrast is recommended for further evaluation.  Heterogeneous and nodular thyroid gland, may represent underlying thyroid nodules. Thyroid ultrasound can be obtained for further evaluation if clinically warranted.  Findings and recommendations were discussed with Dr. Abhay Dhond at 4:15 PM on 12/28/13.  Reported And Signed By: Cheri Phan Nguyen, MD
IMPRESSION: Perihilar groundglass opacities are most suggestive of pulmonary edema in the setting of septal thickening, small effusions (right greater than left) and marked cardiomegaly. However, an infectious or inflammatory process can have a similar appearance on CT and should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Diffusely increased attenuation of the liver parenchyma may be related to amiodarone toxicity, new since 2013.  Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.  No evidence for intrathoracic malignancy  2.  Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, nonspecific, measuring up to 6 mm.

Impression: Progression of disease which likely represents metastatic disease in the lungs bilaterally. There is a destructive mass involving the vertebral bodies with extension of tumor into the spinal canal centered at the right thoracic spine involving the seventh through ninth vertebral bodies. There is potential for compression of the spinal canal. This is not adequately evaluated on this noncontrast examination.  The findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Red critical result.  Reported And Signed By: Amy Sherman, MD
Impression:  1. Moderate bilateral emphysema. 2. Apical scarring, asymmetrically more prominent on the right side.

IMPRESSION:  1. Large complex loculated right-sided pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis of the majority of the right middle and lower lobes. This finding could represent an empyema or a complex parapneumonic effusion.  2. Parts of the atelectatic right lower lobe are heterogeneous, which is concerning for a right lower lobe pneumonia. Recommend follow-up in 6-8 weeks to assess for resolution and to rule out underlying malignancy.  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD
IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of three right chest tubes with markedly decreased loculated pleural effusion and new pockets of air within the pleural space. Persistent right sided pleural thickening.  Improved aeration of the right lung with scattered areas of subsegmental atelectasis. Persistent elevation of the right diaphragm.  New mild mediastinal adenopathy is likely reactive.  Report Initiated By:  Raj Ashok Patel, MD  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD
Impression:   Dense bilateral areas of consolidation as described with mucus plugging and linear calcifications presumably within mucus filled bronchi. These findings are similar in appearance to the chest x-ray findings of one month ago and while they could represent residual infection, noninfectious inflammatory causes should also be considered including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, although calcification is not generally associated with this etiology.  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick MD
IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration bilaterally. There is minimal residual mucous plugging demonstrated bilaterally, right greater than left. There is a hypoattenuating lesion within the dome of liver as above. It appears slightly more prominent on today's evaluation. No additional lesions are appreciated.    Reported And Signed By: Gioia Riccio, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Severely limited study for evaluation of pulmonary embolus; no right or left main pulmonary artery embolism are seen, however evaluation below the level of the main pulmonary arteries is nondiagnostic. If clinical concern for pulmonary embolism persists, a VQ study under sedation could be considered, or a repeat PE study could be attempted after sedation after 24 hours.  2. Soft tissue lesions within the left sixth and seventh rib and the xiphoid process, with likely age indeterminate pathologic fractures at these locations; neoplasm such as plasmacytoma cannot be ruled out. The xiphoid process lesion has increased in size to nearly 4 cm since June 2017.  3. Healing right clavicular and bilateral rib fractures, present on prior imaging. Evaluation of the remainder of the osseous structures is also extremely limited by motion and habitus.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Mezrich, MD 
IMPRESSION: Significantly limited study as above with poor evaluation of the more distal segmental/subsegmental vessels. No large pulmonary embolism or other acute thoracic abnormality identified.  Single 5 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. According to the 2017 Fleischner Society criteria for incidentally found pulmonary nodules of this size and appearance, Single sub-6 mm solid pulmonary nodule(s). In a low risk patient (minimal or no smoking or other known risk factors for malignancy), no follow-up is needed, while in a high risk patient (history of smoking or other known risk factors), consider optional CT follow-up at 12 months.   Report Initiated By:  Casey J Cotton, MD  Reported And Signed By: Susan Marlatt, MD

Impression: 1. Significant interval progression and peripheral predominant pulmonary fibrosis with imaging features most suggestive of fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). This may also represent possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), though this is felt to be less likely due to the degree of groundglass opacity in the areas of fibrosis, the dearth of honeycombing and the significant upper lobe involvement. The peripheral groundglass opacity and bronchovascular consolidation given the fibrotic findings may represent IPF flare, pneumonitis in the setting of drug reaction, and/or organizing pneumonia given the bronchovascular consolidation present at the lung bases. Acute infection including viral and atypical agents should be reliably excluded.  2. No evidence of intrathoracic tumor recurrence with stable findings of a left upper lobectomy. Small left pleural effusion persists.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD

Impression:  1. No explanation for chest pain. 2. Bilateral lung nodules. Based on the recommendations of the Fleischner Chest Society, if this patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, a follow-up chest CT scan in 6-12 months is recommended.  In the absence of a history of smoking or other risk factor, a follow-up chest CT scan is recommended in 1 year.  If there is a history of malignancy, a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months or as per oncology protocol.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD

Impression:   Small bilateral pleural effusions presumably cardiac in origin. No evidence of metastatic disease  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick, MD 
IMPRESSION:  Less than 0.4 cm right lung nodule without change.  Unchanged mild interlobular septal thickening with patchy groundglass parenchymal disease at both lung bases is nonspecific, but could be due to mild congestive heart failure in the small effusions and multichamber cardiac enlargement.  Platelike scarring or atelectasis at lung bases is unchanged.  Hypodensities too small to characterize in left lobe liver without change are nonspecific and could be amenable to interval follow-up.  Heterogeneity of attenuation of liver with lobular contour of liver are unchanged. This could be due to passive hepatic congestion given the presence of the cardiac enlargement. Cirrhosis or cardiac cirrhosis could also cause this appearance.  Gallstones again seen.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD

Right flank and right anterior abdominal wall contusions. 2. Non-specific lung nodules which measure 4 mm or less.  If this patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, a follow-up CT scan in 1 year is recommended.  In the absence of a history of smoking or other risk factor, no further follow-up is required.  If there is a history of malignancy, a follow-up is recommended in 2-3 months or as per oncology protocol. 3. Stable enlargement of the left atrium and splenomegaly  Reported And Signed By: Jamal Bokhari, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearance of the transplanted heart as detailed above. New pulmonary edema with increase in the small pleural effusions. 2. New parenchymal abnormalities that are likely infectious and/or inflammatory in etiology. While this could be due to any infection, in the setting of neutropenia, possibility of fungal infection in particular should be excluded.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
Impression: 1. Bandlike opacity in the left upper lobe which is evident on topogram of the scan today but not evident on 4/4/2006 lateral chest radiograph. Is there a history of radiation therapy that could account for this change? The chest radiograph for comparison is prior to the bilateral mastectomy with TRAM flap reconstruction. Otherwise, would have to be concerned about a neoplastic process. As there are symptoms of cough, another possibility would be that this is inflammatory, although there is some architectural distortion, and followup radiograph or CT following appropriate therapy should be considered. 2. Multiple nodules elsewhere in the lung as described the largest of which is 3.2 x 6.6 mm in the middle lobe. In view of the history of malignancy, Fleischner recommendation would be followup CT between 3 and 6 months, without contrast, or per oncology protocol. 3. Coronary artery calcification.  The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result   Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD
Impression: 1. No significant change in the appearance of a nodule in the left upper lobe which had been previously described and had been worrisome for malignancy; however, development of new nodule in the anterior aspect of the right upper lobe measuring approximately 0.9 x 0.7 CM. This is worrisome for malignancy. 2. Multiple stable appearing nodules elsewhere within the lungs as described above with 2 nodules which are slightly more prominent as compared with the prior, both of which are located in the anterior segment of the right lower lobe. 3. Multiple foci of groundglass opacity seen peripherally in the right lower lobe which may represent foci of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
Impression: 1. Stable opacity left upper lobe unchanged since may 2013. Patient did have a history of radiation for left breast previously. Its conceivably this could be the result of radiation therapy. If there are intervening chest x-rays or CT scans between 2006 and may of this year these would be helpful in further evaluation for stability. The left upper lobe lesion is evident on the lateral topogram today.  2 new focal opacities in the left upper lobe not present in August and likely inflammatory in origin. 3. Stable tiny nodular opacities likely prior granulomatous disease. 4. Emphysema  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. Interval wedge resection of the left lower lobe with new trace partially loculated pleural effusion on the left presumably related to prior surgery. Status post prior bilateral mastectomy with TRAM flap reconstruction.   2. Increased size and density of a left upper lobe spiculated nodule when compared with CT dated 5/15/2013, which also demonstrated FDG uptake on recent PET/CT, with an appearance most concerning for a primary lung neoplasm. Consider further evaluation with histology as clinically warranted (if not previously performed).  3. Scattered small nonspecific pulmonary nodules, most of which are stable, some are new as detailed above. These should be further assessed follow-up exam.  4. New groundglass opacities and septal thickening in the left lower lobe are nonspecific but are suspected to represent an infectious/inflammatory process, less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis.   5. Hyperinflated lungs with emphysema and mild bronchiectasis. Few scattered areas of mucus impaction.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
Impression: Since the most recent prior examination, there has been development of several nodules in the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe, where a single relatively small nodule had been seen. Given their relatively rapid development since the prior and their irregular shape and contour, I feel it is more likely that these represent a manifestation of infection/inflammation rather than progression of malignancy. The remainder of the findings are unchanged.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD

Impression:  1. Overall stable examination with no significant interval change in dominant mass within the left upper lobe compatible with biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma.  2. Stable tubular 13 mm right lower lobe indeterminate pulmonary nodule. At least 2 year stability should be documented. It is feasible that this represents a focally dilated mucous plugging airway.  3. All other pulmonary nodules are stable from May 2013. No new pulmonary nodules.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
Impression: 1. No change in peripheral left upper lobe lesion. 2. Development of fibrotic appearing changes in the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe with somewhat nodular appearing more peripheral portions of these changes in the lower lobes bilaterally. Given the presence of fibrotic disease elsewhere within the lungs extending toward the nodular components, I feel it is more likely that the nodular components do not represent evidence of malignancy. 3. Sclerotic appearance of the lamina of the C7 vertebral body as was present on the prior exam at which likely represents evidence of metastatic disease.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD

IV CONTRAST on 9/20/2017 5:16 PM  INDICATION: Eval for additional clot burden or potential source for distal aortic clot. .  COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and the runoff from 90/19/2017  INTERPRETING PHYSICIAN: Hamid Mojibian, MD  TECHNIQUE: Technique: Prospectively ECG gated CT images of the chest were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the mid abdomen with without contrast. 80 cc Omnipaque 350 was administered intravenously. Coronal MIP reformats are provided. Additionally reformatted images, volume rendered images and MPR images were created.  FINDINGS: Quality of exam: Excellent.  Pertinent prior intervention: None. Aorta: No aortic aneurysm or dissection. Aortic branch vessels: Patent with a conventional branch pattern.   The aorta is normal in size course and contour. No atherosclerotic disease of the aorta or thrombus in the ascending, descending or abdominal aorta is seen. Again is seen partially visualized partial filling defect in the proximal left common iliac artery.   Heart:  The cardiac chambers are visually normal in size. No thrombus in the arch is seen.  Lungs/Airways/Pleura: The lungs are clear. The airways are patent. No pleural effusions.  Mediastinum, Lymph nodes: Unremarkable.  Abdomen: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable  Musculoskeletal system and soft tissue: No aggressive osseous lesion.  Findings are confirmed on the MIP images.  IMPRESSION:  No evidence of atherosclerotic disease or thrombus in the aorta except for partial filling defect in the proximal common iliac artery on the left. No thrombus in the heart. However the study might not be  sensitivities for evaluation of a small thrombus in the heart and probably further evaluation with contrast echo might be more useful.  Reported And Signed By: Hamid Mojibian, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. A linear filling defect in the right upper lobe pulmonary artery may reflect a chronic PE given the extensive pulmonary emboli on the prior study.  2.

Impression:  Left upper lobe lobulated mass very concerning for lung cancer.  Severe emphysema with centrilobular and paraseptal component  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.Severe emphysema both centrilobular and paraseptal 2.Significant progression of the masslike consolidation in both upper lobes with traction bronchiectasis, scarring and calcifications. This suggests ongoing process such as MAI; less likely, chronic organizing pneumonia or is the patient has history of sarcoidosis these could also explain the findings.  It would be very difficult to rule out underlying malignancy particularly in the left upper lobe where the masslike consolidation has become quite dense 3.No change in size of the additional lung nodules. Calcified granulomas and calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes  RECOMMENDATIONS: It is difficult in this examination to differentiate between progression of inflammatory process such as MAI and malignancy. Repeat evaluation for MAI with sputum and if necessary bronchoscopy may be of help. I doubt that PET/CT will be able to differentiate between inflammatory process and malignancy in the left upper lobe The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.No evidence for pulmonary thromboembolism   2.Interval near complete resolution of upper lobe findings, with residual calcified and noncalcified nodular opacities.

Enlarged central pulmonary artery, suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension in the setting of severe emphysema.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging
IMPRESSION:  The CT study is very limited because patient could not hold her breath for the examination.  Right pleural effusion measuring up to 2 cm with no cause identified.  There are air cysts in the left lung along with some air-filled lucencies without perceptible walls that could represent cysts or bullae. This patient does not had history of smoking. Possible causes include  alpha-1 antitrypsin disease and Lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis can be associated with chronic chylous pleural effusion. Prior infection with resulting pneumatoceles could cause this appearance. Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis can occasionally cause air cysts and can be associated with mosaic attenuation of lung, as is seen in this examination. Langerhan's cell histiocytosis is typically associated with smoking. Other causes of air cysts usually are associated with other findings on chest CT that are not present in this examination.

IMPRESSION:  1. No pulmonary embolus.  2. Centrilobular emphysema with scattered areas of air trapping.  3. Nodular groundglass opacity within the left apex is indeterminate but may represent an area of focal infection versus scarring.  Reported And Signed By: Melissa Davis, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. Persistent nodular groundglass/semisolid opacity in the left lung apex. This finding may represent an infectious or inflammatory process, however a malignancy, specifically an early adenocarcinoma may have a similar appearance. Follow-up with noncontrast chest CT is recommended in approximately 8 weeks to evaluate for resolution.  2. Multiple solid pulmonary nodules, largest of which measures 5 mm, as described. These should be followed per Fleischner criteria in approximately 6-12 months.  3. No findings of acute pneumonitis.

Enlarged pulmonary arteries which can be seen in secondary to pulmonary hypertension and possibly related to underlying connective tissue disorder among other etiologies.     Report Initiated By:  Andrew Kuhn, MD  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION: Stable mild interstitial lung disease, could be related to underlying connective-tissue disease. New middle lobe clustered branching nodular opacities, likely representing small airway infection/inflammation. Stable left upper lobe 1.2 cm nodule over multiple priors.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD
IMPRESSION: 1.  Nodular liver morphology with splenomegaly and upper abdominal varices, suggestive of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Prominent abdominal lymph nodes are also noted which is nonspecific but may suggest an underlying systemic  or neoplastic process. In the setting of liver cirrhosis, nonemergent hepatic protocol MRI may be considered. 2.  Multiple age indeterminate superior endplate compression deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine. While these may be chronic, no prior comparison studies are available, and acuity is not excluded in this study. Clinical correlation for point tenderness is recommended and MRI evaluation may be considered if acutely tender. 3.  Left anterior second through fourth rib cortical irregularities, may reflect age-indeterminate nondisplaced fractures. Clinical correlation for point tenderness is suggested.  Findings discussed with Mona Lalehzari, MD at 4:01 AM on 2/10/2020  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Mezrich, MD

Diffuse patchy airspace opacities, most consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is likely reactive.  Reported And Signed By: Margarita Revzin, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. Interval resolution of multifocal pneumonia. Residual right middle lobe scarring and prominent right epicardial fat pad likely account for findings on chest radiograph. No lung mass is identified.  2. There is persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is nonspecific but may be physiologic or reactive.  3. Pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm, stable since March 2016. In a low risk patient (minimal or no smoking history or other known risk factors for malignancy), consider optional CT follow-up in 12 months to document more long-term stability. In a high-risk patient (history of smoking or other known risk factors), follow-up CT in 12 months is recommended.  4. Hepatic steatosis.  Reported By:  Jason Hao, MD  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD

IMPRESSION: 1. Decrease in size of the recently seen 9 mm right lower lobe nodule, now measuring 6 mm, most consistent with resolving infectious/inflammatory etiology. Unchanged 4.5 mm right lower lobe nodule and a couple 7-7.5 mm left upper lobe nodules that have not been previously imaged are indeterminant and require follow-up according to the Fleischner Society guidelines. Follow-up recommendations according to the Fleischner Society for incidentally found pulmonary nodules measuring 6-8 mm: Initial follow-up CT at 6-12 months, then CT at 18-24 months if no change.  2. Upper lobe predominant emphysema. Peripheral reticulations in the posterior bilateral lower lobes raise concern for mild/moderate interstitial lung disease but could also be related to subsegmental atelectasis and/or aspiration.  3. Ascending aorta aneurysm measuring up to 4.1 cm. Extensive calcification of the aortic valve leaflets, which may result in the valvular stenosis.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva 
IMPRESSION: There is a new 6.7 mm solid nodule in the medial basal right lower lobe in a paravertebral location (image 183/series 3). Stable left upper and lingular nodules. Previously described right lower lobe 6 mm and 4 mm and left lower lobe 4 mm nodules not visualized on today's exam. Consider thoracic CT in 3-6 months.  Emphysematous changes.  Ascending aortic aneurysm, significant coronary artery disease and aortic valvular disease.  Reported And Signed By: Paul A Aiello, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. New nodules in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Given their rapid appearance and current size, these are felt to be most likely atelectatic or infectious/inflammatory in nature. This could be followed by repeat chest CT in 6 months according to Fleischner Society criteria. Other stable nodules are noted in the lung fields bilaterally. The stable nodules are due for repeat evaluation in May 2019 according to Fleischner Society criteria. 2. Emphysematous changes without significant change. 3. Stable ascending aortic aneurysm.  Reported And Signed By: John Donahue, MD
IMPRESSION:  Interval near resolution of right middle lobe and lower lobe nodules as above. Stable 7 mm left upper lobe nodules. Repeat CT in 6-12 months is recommended.  Reported And Signed By: Anna Bader, MD
IMPRESSION:  No interval change in left upper lobe pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm compared with studies going back to May 2017. No new pulmonary nodules. These nodules are likely benign given stability,  however given risk factors for pulmonary malignancy, this patient should consider participating in a lung cancer screening program.   Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD
IMPRESSION:  New left lower lobe 6 mm nodule and middle lobe 6.5 mm groundglass nodule which may be inflammatory or infectious in nature. Consider follow-up in 3-6 months to ensure resolution or stability.  Report Initiated By:  Manijeh Zehtabchi, MD  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD
IMPRESSION:  Resolution of the previously new right middle lobe and left paravertebral lower lobe nodules. Stable left upper lobe 7 mm nodule. No new or enlarging lung nodules. Severe emphysema.  Stable prominent and mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. No new thoracic adenopathy.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD
 New trace right pleural effusion and right apical pneumothorax.  Worsening groundglass opacity in the anterior right upper lobe. New lower lobe predominant reticulation. Differential diagnosis includes developing interstitial lung disease, including drug reaction given known lymphoma, and, consider less likely, pulmonary edema. Irregular patchy opacity at the right costophrenic angle and nodularity along the right minor fissure, may be related to the ongoing inflammatory process. Mild mediastinal adenopathy is increased compared to prior exam, may be reactive.  Findings discussed with Dr. Boffa at the time of this dictation.  Reported And Signed By: Anna Bader, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging
 Stable background of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. New right lower lobe peribronchial groundglass opacity, likely inflammatory in nature. Follow-up in 3 months is recommended to ensure resolution.  Stable prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging 
IMPRESSION:   No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic pathology.  Bilateral perihilar patchy opacities favored to represent pulmonary edema in the setting of cardiomegaly, however multifocal pneumonia could have the same CT appearance and may also be considered in the appropriate clinical circumstances.  Reported By:  Tyler McKay, MD  Reported And Signed By: Syed Jamal Bokhari, MD
IMPRESSION:  Sub-6 mm solid pulmonary nodules are indeterminate in the absence of prior chest CTs to assess long-term stability. Recommend follow-up chest CT in 3 months or according to patient's oncology protocol.  Nonspecific 6 mm subsolid right upper lobe nodule and scattered sub-6 mm groundglass nodules do not have the CT appearance of metastasis and may be infectious/inflammatory in etiology. These can be reassessed on the above recommended follow-up chest CT.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD
Comparison: No prior comparison imaging is available at the time of dictation at this institution.Findings and impression:   Technique: CT images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis. Intravenous contrast was not administered due to elevated creatinine.  Findings: Study is limited due to the absence of intravenous contrast.  Chest:  There are serial fractures of the lateral 3rd - 6th left rib and posterior 4th - 10th left ribs. A small left pneumothorax is identified anteriorly. There is a small amount of hyperattenuating density in the dependent lower left portion of the left lung adjacent to the posterior fractures.  Similar, there are fractures of the third through fifth posterior right ribs with similarly adjacent small amount of  hyperattenuating density. These likely represent pulmonary contusion with possibly a small amount of blood. However, without IV contrast this is not possible to differentiate.   The central airways are patent.   Heart and large vessels are normal in size. There is no axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Abdomen and pelvis: The noncontrast enhanced liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney are unremarkable. A 2.9 cm cyst is noted in the mid upper pole of the left kidney. Subtle injuries including laceration or fracture of the solid organs cannot be excluded without IV contrast. There is a mild rectus diathesis with tethering of the small bowel region. No bowel obstruction, or free air, free fluid is  identified.   There is no lymphadenopathy. No pelvic mass is seen.   No aggressive osseous lesions are identified.  Thoracic and lumbar spine reformats:: There is no fracture or dislocation. There are degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine.  IMPRESSION:   Markedly limited exam for trauma as IV contrast was not administered. Injury to the solid organs and/or major vessels cannot be excluded by this exam.  1.Serial bilateral rib fractures as detailed above with concern for left frail rib cage and adjacent contusion/ possibly small amount of blood. Small left pneumothorax. 2.No definite traumatic injury to the abdomen. However, absence of IV contrast limits the sensitivity for solid organ injuries and injury to the major vessels as noted above.   The critical findings described above were communicated verbally at time of examination and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication with Andrea Kopoly) critical result.   Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Kirsch, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. Evaluation of the more distal pulmonary tree is limited secondary to contrast bolus timing/mixing artifact and rapid contrast clearance in this young patient.  2. Dependent ground glass opacity at the right greater than left lung base may reflect atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes although mild infiltrate, including aspiration changes and/or sequela of patient's prior Covid infection could present similarly and should correlated for clinically.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Mezrich, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Normal-size heart with pacemaker. Moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium. 3. Scattered areas of subsegmental atelectasis, most pronounced in the left lower lobe. 4. Few less than 4 mm nonspecific lung nodules.

Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION:  No dominant lung lesions to suggest primary lung malignancy. Pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm which are nonspecific and likely not significant unless extrathoracic malignancy is found.  Indeterminate sclerotic lesion in the left seventh rib which may represent a bone island. No adenopathy within the thorax.  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD

IMPRESSION:   Motion degraded exam.  1. Scattered pulmonary nodules measuring 4 mm or less, stable dating back to 2013 compatible with benign etiology. No further follow-up of these nodules is necessary, unless there is a change in the patient's clinical status.  Alternatively, if the patient has smoking history or risk factors for lung cancer, then consideration could be made to enroll in a dedicated lung cancer screening program with yearly surveillance low-dose chest CTs as clinically warranted.  2. Nonspecific septal thickening in both upper lobes as detailed above of uncertain etiology, which appears similar compared to the most recent prior exam, however is new compared to the examination from 2015.

IMPRESSION: 1. Irregular 1.4 cm right upper lobe nodule, new when compared to the prior chest CT from 2007 and corresponding to the abnormality seen on the recent chest radiograph. This nodule is indeterminate and while it may be infectious/inflammatory in etiology, malignancy is not excluded. The adjacent groundglass and consolidative opacities favor an infectious etiology but the other scattered right-sided lung nodules and concomitant right mediastinal lymphadenopathy favor malignancy. This nodule can be further evaluated with PET/CT and/or biopsy for definite diagnosis. Alternatively, a follow-up chest CT can be done in 2-3 months to assess for interval change if clinically this nodule is thought to represent an infection. 2. Two similar appearing 5-5.5 mm right upper lobe nodules and a 4 mm right lower lobe nodule are likely related to the dominant right apical nodule and are amenable to follow up. These nodules are below the resolution of PET/CT and are probably not amenable to biopsy. 3. New right upper and lower paratracheal lymphadenopathy is also likely related to the dominant right apical nodule and increase the concern for malignancy as etiology. These nodes are amenable to transbronchial biopsy. 4. Cardiomegaly with interval increase in size of the cardiac chambers when compared to the prior chest CT from 2007. 5. Ectatic ascending aorta measuring up to 3.9 cm. Enlarged main pulmonary artery is nonspecific but suggests pulmonary hypertension.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva

Additional small groundglass and more solid nodules are unchanged.  Reported By:  Sarah Steenbergen, MD  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD
Impression: 1. Significant progression of nodules over the course of the 2 prior examinations with some of the nodules being entirely solid and having grown and others being semisolid with central cavitation, also having grown.

IMPRESSION:  Right pleural effusion has enlarged in left pleural effusion is slightly larger.  Extensive consolidation and volume loss in right lower lobe and adjacent right middle lobe appears slightly more extensive than previously with more extensive opacification of segmental and subsegmental bronchi. This could be due to progression of radiation changes, inflammatory or infectious process, or recurrence of neoplasm.  Other parenchymal abnormalities are stable.  Nonhealed right eighth rib fracture without change.  New healing right posterior lateral right sixth rib fracture with some adjacent patchy sclerosis. This sclerosis was not present on the prior examination favoring this representing sclerosis due to healing rather than underlying bone lesion.

Impression:   Benign scarring right lung base requiring no further follow-up  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick MD
IMPRESSION: There is a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, and consolidation within the right middle and right lower lobes. There is no shift of the mediastinum, or depression of the diaphragm. The pleural effusion is located posteriorly and in the subpulmonic location.  Overall there is mild volume loss within the right hemithorax. A small nodule is seen in the right middle lobe with a linear configuration likely pleural-based scar of 7 x 3 mm. Atelectasis is also noted within the left lower lobe. Small left-sided pleural effusion is also present.  There is no evidence of cavitation within the parenchyma consolidation.. A single minute focal calcification is seen within the right lower lobe area of consolidation.  Within the limitations of a noncontrast study, there is mild adenopathy in the precarinal region, with a precarinal node measuring 1.7 x 0.9 cm.  The cardiac chambers appear unremarkable. Thyroid gland soft tissues of the breast, axillary lymph nodes appear unremarkable.  Upper abdominal structures limited by absence of intra-abdominal fat. Osseous structures are preserved.

The right-sided pleural effusion is amenable to aspiration for further diagnostic purposes.  Reported And Signed By: Caroline Taylor
IMPRESSION: Multiloculated right effusion/empyema with decreased fluid compared to October 2018 status post chest tube placement. There is a small pocket of air anteriorly in the region of the chest tube, as well as a separate loculated fluid collection at the posterior medial right lung base, potentially communicating with the lateral component.   Right middle and lower lobe consolidation suggests pneumonia, with overall improved aeration of the right lung since prior study. Reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Unchanged irregular 7 mm left upper lobe nodule; while this may be infectious/inflammatory, continued attention on follow-up imaging.  Mild paraseptal emphysema.    Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD
Impression: 1. Since the examination of over 4 years previously, there has been the development of very mild fibrosis in the right lung consisting of an increase in peripheral reticular markings. This appears somewhat more extensive than that which is typically seen with radiation. It is more typical for that which is seen in early nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. 2. Couple of small stable geographic areas of groundglass opacity compared with an examination of over 4 years ago. This is likely of no significance. 3. No evidence of metastatic disease.   Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD

IMPRESSION: Irregular opacity in the left upper lobe with extension into superior segment of the left lower lobe through and incomplete major fissure. Opacity along the right major fissure with similar configuration.. Multiple groundglass opacities throughout both lungs. The combination of these findings suggest that some of these lesions could be inflammatory. However, the spiculated appearance particularly of the left upper lobe consolidation could be due to lung cancer.  Recommendations:  Given the multiple bilateral groundglass opacities and areas of consolidation, a potential management approach in this 80-year-old patient could be to repeat the examination in a 4 week interval after treatment for pneumonia and monitor for any decrease in size. if there is no change , then, malignancy should be considered  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Mild interval increase in size of the left upper lobe irregular opacity, suspicious for primary malignancy. Further evaluation with biopsy can be obtained.  2.

Report Initiated By:  Rajiv Raju, MD  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD
IMPRESSION:    1. Subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe without compelling evidence of right heart strain, however correlation with cardiac echo could be considered. Questionable additional subsegmental embolus at the right lung base. Visualization of the subsegmental arteries are limited secondary to contrast bolus timing/mixing artifact and respiratory motion.  2. Interlobular septal thickening, diffuse groundglass and left upper lobe pulmonary nodules essentially unchanged as compared to prior study of CT scan of 5/12/2020, and may be infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic in etiology  3. Cortical irregularities of the sternum in the sagittal view are favored to reflect respiratory motion artifact, however correlation for point tenderness is suggested to rule out acuity.  These findings were discussed via telephone with Buck, Samuel, MD on 6/19/2020 3:50 PM.    Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Mezrich, MD
IMPRESSION:  Nondisplaced fractures are seen in the left lateral fifth and sixth ribs.   Minimally displaced fractures are seen in the posterior left seventh and lateral left eighth ribs.     Reported By:  Austin Moats, MD  Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD

Enlarged pulmonary arteries which can be seen with pulmonary hypertension. 2. Consolidation in the left greater than right lower lobes compatible with atelectasis and/or aspiration/pneumonia. 3. Few scattered small lung nodules measuring up to 4 mm in size which could be further evaluated with follow-up chest CT in 1 year as clinically warranted to document stability. 4. Peripheral low-density areas in the spleen, new since prior abdominal CT and likely reflect infarcts.    Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
Impression: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism. 2. Patchy groundglass opacities mostly in the lower lobes but some nodular foci of groundglass opacity present in the right upper lobe as well. These findings are nonspecific but could be infectious or inflammatory in etiology. 3. Suggestion of subtle upper lobe centrilobular groundglass nodules which can be seen with smoking related interstitial lung disease in this patient with mild emphysema or less likely hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Please correlate with clinical parameters and exposure history. 4. Tiny less than 4 mm upper lobe nodules are nonspecific but may simply be infectious or postinflammatory in etiology. As clinically warranted, a follow-up chest CT could be performed in one year to document stability.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION:  Within the limitations of the study, there are small filling questionable filling defects within the segmental pulmonary artery branches of the left lower lobe which may be artifactual.  Interval progression of the pericardial effusion, new pleural effusions bilaterally and worsening bilateral consolidations, consistent with progressing multifocal pneumonia.  Extensive thoracic lymphadenopathy as described  Reported And Signed By: Elliott Brown, MD
Impression: Resolved reactive mediastinal adenopathy.  New cavitary lung lesions in the right lower lobe. This carries a wide differential diagnosis. Per my review of medical record, the patient has a history of IV drug abuse and recent abscess drainage, therefore septic emboli is high on the differential diagnosis.  Reported And Signed By: Jay Pahade, MD
IMPRESSION: Multiple cavitary lesions throughout the lungs consistent with septic emboli.  Reported And Signed By: Michael Spektor, MD
IMPRESSION:  Slightly limited examination due to breathing motion artifact. Within this limitation, the patient is status post sternotomy with a small amount of nonspecific fluid seen deep to the inferior sternum, without rim-enhancing collection along the anterior or posterior sternum. Nonfusion of the sternum is nonspecific given relatively recent sternotomy.  Near complete interval resolution of previously described diffuse cavitary lung lesions.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar compressive atelectasis.  Reported By:  Kirsten Cooper, MD  Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD

IMPRESSION:  1. Groundglass opacity in the right upper lobe consistent with acute infectious/inflammatory process. 2. Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm. If this patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, an initial follow-up chest CT scan in 3-6 months is recommended.  In the absence of a history of smoking or other risk factor, an initial follow-up chest CT scan is recommended in 6-12 months.  If there is a history of malignancy, a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months or as per oncology protocol. 3. Enlarged central pulmonary artery is compatible with pulmonary hypertension. 4. Cardiomegaly with signs of right heart failure.  Reported By:  Douglas Herrin, MD  Reported And Signed By: Joseph Cavallo, MD

Cardiomegaly and calcific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. New small pericardial effusion with enhancement of the pericardium that is typically seen with an exudative effusion (such as from pericarditis, connective tissue disorder or malignancy).   A Red message has been communicated to this patient's provider via the PowerScribe 360 Critical Results application on 3/14/2019 11:45 AM, Message ID 3262778.

IMPRESSION:  No pulmonary embolism or other acute pulmonary process.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCann, MD 
Impression:   Volume loss right lung with patchy areas of groundglass attenuation and peripheral consolidations with minimal but similar findings in the left lower lobe. There is also obstruction of segmental bronchi to the right lower lobe. Because of the time course this is unlikely due to infection. This could be a stage of interstitial lung disease but it is quite asymmetrical. Neoplasm should be considered particularly with the bronchial obstruction. These findings could be due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis  (Wegener granulomatosis) particularly with the bronchial involvement.  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. Significant interval progression of right-sided airspace disease, now with extensive, confluent consolidation throughout the majority of the right lung and opacification of the right basilar subsegmental airways. Airspace disease persists seen of the left lower lung zone has also mildly increased. There is also dependent fluid and secretions within the trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi, which may predispose to aspiration. This was not seen on the prior CT. New findings are likely infectious/inflammatory in etiology, but underlying neoplasm and postobstructive etiology cannot be excluded.  2. Right-sided pneumothorax with chest tube in place. Compared to the prior x-ray this pneumothorax appears to increase in size. Small locules of air at the lung bases may represent loculated pneumothorax.   Reported And Signed By: Al Hasan Makkouk, MD 
 1.  Pulmonary, hepatic, splenic and bowel findings most suggestive of decreased perfusion, of uncertain etiology however, in the setting of presumed multisystem inflammatory syndrome, with possibly a component of infectious airspace consolidation and colitis/enterocolitis as detailed above. 2.  Additionally abnormal splenic enhancement is likely due to reduced perfusion in the setting of sickle cell disease in addition to possible component of the suspected multisystem inflammatory syndrome. 3.  Moderately large bilateral pleural effusions and large volume ascites.  Report Initiated By:  Aditya Rao, MD  Reported And Signed By: Syed Jamal Bokhari, MD

Bilateral pulmonary contusions (left greater than right) with a left pneumothorax and left-sided chest tube.  3. Possible area of low attenuation is noted along the lateral border of the spleen may represent a small laceration/hematoma. No other evidence of visceral traumatic injury or pneumoperitoneum is seen.  The critical findings described above were communicated verbally and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.  Reported And Signed By: RENU CHUNDRU
Impression: 1. Resolution of left-sided subcutaneous emphysema and significant decrease in size of left-sided pneumothorax when compared with the examination of 5 days previously. 2. Development of moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion with associated airspace disease in the right lower lobe, presumably compressive atelectasis. 3. Persistent airspace disease in the left lower lobe which may represent pneumonia. 4. No evidence of edema as was questioned in the requisition.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Small, subsegmental pulmonary emboli. No CT evidence of right heart strain. Enlarged pulmonary arteries which can be seen with pulmonary hypertension.  2. Dilated ascending aorta measuring up to 4.4 cm. 3.

IMPRESSION: 1. New bronchitis and right lower lung bronchopneumonia. Retained secretions in the central airways suggest aspiration as etiology. 2. Long term stability of a nonspecific smaller than 4 mm left upper lobe nodule. No new lung nodules. 3. Stable thoracic aorta aneurysm with the ascending portion measuring up to 4.2 cm  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva 
Impression: Parenchymal pattern which is characterized by a diffuse increase in groundglass opacities which alternate with areas of abnormal lung attenuation and a diffuse increase in traction bronchiectasis with one small focus which appears consolidated in the left upper lobe although with the benefit of coronal images, it appears most likely that this represents a manifestation of interstitial lung disease rather than of infection or of malignancy. Given the moderate amount of groundglass opacity and the absence of honeycombing, it is most likely that this represents fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
Impression:  1.  Extensive geographic groundglass opacities with traction bronchiectases that have not significantly changed in distribution or severity compared to the study from November 2013 but have severely progressed since 2008. 2.  Moderate to severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. 3.  Stable 1.7 cm right upper lobe density which could represent confluent fibrotic changes. Given the increased risk of malignancy in fibrotic changes, a follow-up within 12 months is recommended.  Reported By:  Alexander Goehler, MD  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. Extensive fibrotic lung disease in a similar pattern of distribution compared to prior exam, likely NSIP pattern.  2. Previously described left upper lobe nodular density is less prominent and likely represents part of fibrotic lung disease in that location. No discrete nodule is identified.  Reported By:  Feng Jiang, MD  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary embolism or other acute pulmonary process. Stable fibrotic lung disease.  Reported And Signed By: Neil Kapadia, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. No significant change since recent prior CTs in fibrotic interstitial lung disease presumably secondary to underlying connective tissue disorder, however which is new/significantly progressed from older prior CTs. 2. Groundglass opacities which were new on the most recent prior CT and likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology have since resolved. Other areas of groundglass opacity are stable. 3. Bronchiectasis and mosaic lung attenuation again seen presumably secondary to air trapping (correlate clinically to exclude bronchiolitis obliterans) may also be related to patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis. 4. Multiple indeterminate nodular densities which are new since 2008 and most have not significantly changed since 11/2013, except for a right apical nodule which is new since 2013 and a left lower lobe nodule which is new from 2015. While these could be infectious/inflammatory or postinflammatory nodules, cannot exclude possibility that one or more of these reflects a lung neoplasm. A PET/CT may be helpful for further evaluation versus histologic sampling or CT follow-up (in 3-6 months).  The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result              Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD

IMPRESSION: 1. Small right pneumothorax with chest tube in place. 2. Worsening airspace opacities within the bilateral lower lobes superimposed to the background of fibrotic interstitial lung disease may be related to inflammation (ILD exacerbation/organizing pneumonia), aspiration, or infection depending on the clinical setting. 3. No change in previously seen bilateral nodular densities.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva 
IMPRESSION: Improvement in groundglass opacities seen previously toward the lung bases. No significant change in chronic fibrotic lung disease worse in the lung bases and in the left upper lobe anteriorly. Right-sided pneumothorax, increased from prior exam, with right chest tube in place.   Reported And Signed By: Jennifer Kim, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Interval change in position of the right pleural chest tube, which now terminates at the posterior costophrenic angle. Interval increase in size of the right pneumothorax with new leftward shift of the mediastinum. New nodular thickening of the right parietal pleura, likely due to multiloculated trace pleural fluid given fast interval development. 2. Interval development of extensive bilateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. 3. Bilateral lower lobe airspace opacities are increased from 3/26/2017 but similar to 3/17/2017 and therefore likely due to waxing waning lung inflammation in this patient with chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease. 4. Unchanged bilateral pulmonary nodules.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva 
Impression: Interval placement of right anterior chest tube with substantial decrease in loculated right anterior pneumothorax and associated mass effect and mediastinal shift. No significant interval change in additional chronic chest findings.  Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Stable background of chronic lung fibrosis, compatible with patient's known RA related ILD. No acute airspace opacities.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease with a central distribution, unchanged compared with recent prior studies but worsening compared with studies going back to 2014. This likely represents predominant cause of shortness of breath.  3. There is increasing consolidation laterally in the left upper lobe this site which previously had been a large cyst. This likely represents an infection with may be acute on chronic.  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Chronic fibrotic interstitial lung disease, stable when compared with recent prior studies, with superimposed extensive patchy centrilobular groundglass opacities and nodules throughout the left lung, slightly improved, and scattered centrilobular nodules in the right lung apex/upper lobe, slightly worsened when compared with study of 12/2/2019.

No evidence of acute traumatic injury to the thoracic or lumbar spine.   Report Initiated By:  Abedalrazaq Alkukhun, MD  Reported And Signed By: Jason Teitelbaum, MD
Impression: 1. Acute pulmonary embolus within a few left upper lobe branches as discussed. 2. New complete collapse of the right lower lobe which is at least partially related to a endobronchial lesion at the right lower lobe bronchus origin as discussed. 3. New large right pleural effusion. 4. Significant interval increase in size of right lung mass as discussed. 5. Near occlusive thrombus at the junction of the superior vena cava with the left brachiocephalic vein. Potential propagation of this clot into the right subclavian and jugular veins cannot be excluded by this examination and may be best assessed with a focused ultrasound exam, if clinically warranted.

Both findings are stable from the 2008 study.  4. Indeterminate solid noncalcified 6 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule. Given the patient's extensive centrilobular emphysema, the increased risk of lung cancer is presumed. Follow-up imaging is recommended with a noncontrast chest CT with and 6-12 months time towards documenting a total two-year stability or resolution.     Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
Impression:  1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  2. Slight interval increase in groundglass opacity. Given its dependent nature, this likely reflects atelectasis with possible superimposed mild interstitial edema. There is no frank pulmonary edema or evidence of focal airspace consolidation.  3. Indeterminate 6 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule with imaging recommendations as from the 7/15/2014 CT study.  4. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are unchanged and have been described in the previous report.    Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.  Stable 6 mm noncalcified right middle lobe nodule. Repeat chest CT scan is recommended in 6 months as part of a 2 year surveillance of this nodule  2.

RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.Nodule which is likely a subpleural lymph node rather than parenchymal nodule is stable since 7/2014. As this is a subpleural lymph node I don't think further follow-up of this particular nodule is indicated. 2. There are aneurysms of the ascending and transverse aortic arch. The transverse aneurysm is increased 4 mm in 7 years. The ascending aorta has increased 4 mm in 7 years as well. Consider referral to an aortic specialist for further evaluation such as formal CTA of the aorta depending on the comorbidities of the patient who has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.. 3. Severe emphysema with residual groundglass opacity at the right lung base which has been decreasing since prior exams as have groundglass opacities in the left lung base. 4. Status post sternotomy with CABG and severe coronary artery calcification.  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD

Nonspecific left lower lobe pulmonary nodules amenable to follow-up on future imaging studies.  3. Stranding adjacent to the left kidney with minimal thickening of the proximal left ureter and a few prominent subcentimeter adjacent retroperitoneal lymph nodes. These findings are of unclear etiology but may related to leakage from an adjacent renal cyst with the ureteral thickening and prominent lymph nodes reactive in etiology. Findings should be correlated with history of hematuria and are amenable to reevaluation on short-term imaging follow-up in approximately 3 months.  Reported And Signed By: Mahan Mathur, MD

IMPRESSION:  1.Again there is nodular protuberance into the pericardium which measures considerably greater than simple fluid attenuation. Given the rapid appearance of this since the outside study of April 25, 2016, it is conceivable that this represents organized pericardial fluid as there was a large pericardial effusion at that time which is largely resolved.  2.Adjacent to the abnormality of the pericardium, there is abnormality of the pleura. While this could represent metastatic disease to the pleura, again it would be quite in usual for it to arise so rapidly given the absence of metastatic disease in other locations within the chest. Again it is possible that this represents organization of pleural fluid adjacent to pericardial abnormality.  3.Small dependent left-sided pleural effusion.  4.Consolidation in the lower lobes which could well represent pneumonia, right greater than left.

Impression:  1. No definite evidence to suggest interval acute pulmonary embolism. Vascular narrowing and interruption consistent with sequela of bilateral lower lobe chronic pulmonary embolism with peripheral consolidation suggestive of pulmonary infarcts are noted, right greater than the left. An ill-defined hypodensity within a branch point in the right posterior lower lobar region may reflect acute or chronic embolism but is not as well appreciated in reformatted views. 2. Interval development of new patchy and peripheral opacities within the right middle and upper lung lobes, may represent new infarcts or infectious/inflammatory findings in the appropriate clinical setting. 3. Stable cardiomegaly.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Mezrich, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. Mural calcification seen in the wall of the lower right brachiocephalic vein with a more amorphous mural associated radiodensity within the lower SVC. Given the presence of chronic indwelling hemodialysis catheter, these may be related to eccentric thrombi. This cannot be further assessed without intravenous contrast. If indicated, further evaluation with a noncontrast MRA of the chest may be obtained.   2. Overall mixed response to patchy groundglass opacities with worsening interlobular septal thickening in the lungs and centrilobular nodules in the left upper lobe. There is more bronchial dilation and cavitation in the left lung and these findings are decreased in the right lung. The imaging findings are nonspecific but likely related to a multifocal infection. A component of pulmonary edema may also be present.    Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Nodular densities in the right lower lobe measuring up to 1.7 cm are new since 9/2020. While nonspecific, rapid appearance is most suggestive of either infectious or inflammatory etiology. 2. Background of diffuse groundglass opacity including with centrilobular groundglass nodularity is nonspecific however differential diagnostic considerations include: infection (including viral or opportunistic), inflammation, pulmonary hemorrhage, or pulmonary edema. Other uncommon entities such as talcosis or extramedullary hematopoiesis are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting. Please correlate with clinical parameters and further evaluation with a diagnostic procedure (such as bronchoscopy/biopsy) may be warranted.   Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION: Overall mildly increased diffuse groundglass and septal thickening since 9/29/2020, most likely pulmonary edema in this clinical setting.  New and worsening patchy and nodular opacities at the dependent lower lobes may represent a combination of atelectasis and infection/inflammation.  Stable small pericardial effusion.  Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD
Impression:  1. Areas of groundglass attenuation right upper lobe. Three-month follow-up is suggested to determine if these are transient and inflammatory. 2. Small focal lesion posteriorly in the right hepatic lobe. Ultrasound is suggested to determine if it is a small cyst or a small echogenic lesion such as hemangioma.  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Tiny right apical pneumothorax versus loculated collection of air and fluid. 2. Large right pleural effusion containing a Pleurex catheter and air. Small left pleural effusion. 3. Multiple regions of airspace lung consolidation as detailed above, greatest in the lower lobes, and concerning for multilobar pneumonia. 4. Enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, possibly reactive from an underlying infectious process, however followup is recommended.  Findings discussed with Dr. Harriman at 6:23pm   Reported By:  William Pechter, MD  Reported And Signed By: Jignesh Modi
Impression:  1. Interval decrease in right-sided and stable left-sided loculated pleural effusions in comparison with 10/3/2013 study, with similar mild abdominal ascites. The right-sided pleural catheter is in stable position, with tip in the posterior inferior-medial aspect.  2. New two 6 mm nodules in the right upper lobe as described. Followup in 6-12 months is recommended.  3. Stable marked aortic valvular calcifications suggestive of aortic stenosis. Consider cardiac echo as per clinical discretion.  4. Stable thyromegaly.  5. Cirrhotic liver morphology.  Reported By:  Syed Ali, MD  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Killam, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.New 7mm ill defined, indeterminate nodular density in the right middle lobe is possibly a focus of scarring/subsegmental atelectasis adjacent to the right hemidiaphragm.  However, a primary lung neoplasm could appear similar and is not excluded, especially in this patient with history of smoking and emphysema. This does not have the appearance of a metastasis. Follow up chest CT in 3 months is recommended to further assess.   2.Other small nonspecific pulmonary nodules, some of which are stable and likely benign, and small left pleural based nodule which can be further assessed at follow up imaging given stability.    3.Focal cystic lesion now present in the thymic bed possibly reflecting a thymic cyst versus cystic thymoma. MRI of the chest may be helpful for further evaluation.   4.Cirrhosis and known hepatocellular carcinoma is better evaluated on recent contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen.  The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result   Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1.  Right interlobar and right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli.   2.  Multifocal peripheral groundglass and consolidative changes throughout both lungs, consistent with multifocal infection/inflammation. Correlation with viral testing is recommended. In addition, more wedge-shaped consolidation at the right lung base may represent a superimposed pulmonary infarct, although evaluation is difficult in the setting of background inflammatory changes.   These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. Pranay Sunku to Dr. Neumann on 1/25/2021 6:59 PM. A provider-to-provider communication for a Green message has been documented in the Nuance Actionable Findings application  on 1/25/2021 7:00 PM.

IMPRESSION:  Multiple bilateral solid and groundglass opacities within the lungs likely represent an infectious/inflammatory process, however, metastatic disease cannot be excluded in a patient with history of prostate cancer. Follow-up imaging in 6-8 weeks after appropriate therapy with a noncontrast chest CT is recommended to document resolution.  Cholelithiasis is present without CT evidence of acute cholecystitis.  Multiple lucencies within the spine are nonspecific and not in keeping with patient's history of prostate cancer. Additional etiologies should be considered, possibly superimposed malignant or metabolic process.  Findings were discussed with Monico, MD at 8:55 PM on 6/16/2019.

IMPRESSION: 1. Status post prior right middle and right lower lobectomies. Loculated right-sided hydropneumothorax again seen with decreased air but increased fluid component. In addition, a partially loculated right pleural effusion present inferiorly again contains multiple locules of air which is concerning for superinfection, consider correlation with fluid analysis to exclude empyema. In addition, as the patient is 2 weeks postoperative, persistent pneumothorax raises the possibility of bronchopleural fistula.  2. Increasing groundglass opacity in the right upper lobe with clustered nodules again seen, likely infectious in etiology. However, given the septal thickening, superimposed edema or hemorrhage could also have this appearance.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION: The patient is status post right upper lobectomy and left lower lobe superior segmentectomy. 1. Interval increase in size and thickness of pleural based nodular densities as detailed above, concerning for pleural metastatic disease.

IMPRESSION:  Left acetabular pelvic fracture with associated hematoma as above.  The critical findings described above were communicated verbally with Dr. Liu at 12:45 PM and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.  Reported By:  Felix Nautsch, MD  Reported And Signed By: Gowthaman Gunabushanam, MD
Impression:  1. Groundglass opacities which are scattered could represent evidence of viral pneumonitis, but given the history of the patient being status post lung transplant and history of rejection, this could also represent organizing pneumonia.  2. Lower lobe predominant bronchiectasis with significant bronchial wall thickening. This could be a reflection of a chronic infectious process or prior infection. Lower lobe predominant bronchiectasis is not typical for cystic fibrosis, and the patient would not be expected to be manifesting radiographic evidence of cystic fibrosis as he is 20 years post lung transplant. 3. Mosaic attenuation possible air trapping. As per above, air trapping could not be assessed given that the images which were supposed to be expiratory images did not differ from the initial images. If lucencies do indeed represent air trapping, this is compatible with bronchiolitis obliterans.   4. Chronic appearing right pleural effusion.   Reported By:  Sania Rahim-Gilani, MD  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Imaging findings are compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Given the comminution of airspace consolidation and groundglass opacity this may be multifactorial agents including bacterial, fungal and viral.   2.

IMPRESSION:  1.  1.7 cm right upper lobe spiculated nodule is concerning for primary lung neoplasm. Moderate right pleural effusion is likely malignant given pleural nodularity and multiple right lung pulmonary nodules abutting the pleura. 2.  1.8 cm left upper lobe groundglass nodule and 1.6 cm left lower lobe groundglass nodule are nonspecific but likely along the adenocarcinoma spectrum. 3.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 4.  Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited due to streak artifact.

IMPRESSION:  1. Stable findings consistent with lung cancer including the dominant right upper lobe nodule measuring up to 1.6 cm, right pleural nodularity, and mediastinal adenopathy. The right pleural nodularity appears more prominent compared with the prior study however this may be partially due to differences in contrast timing.  2. There is a large right-sided pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis of the right middle and lower lobes.  3. Ground glass nodules in the left lung measuring up to 2 cm. These nodules likely represent adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions and can be followed on subsequent imaging.  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange, MD

The mid ascending aorta measures 4 cm.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging 
Impression: 1. Lesion in the left upper lobe which had been seen previously and had likely represented an adenocarcinoma in situ given its predominant groundglass appearance with pseudo-cavitation which now has a more solid component measuring approximately 0.5 CM. It is this latter component which is suggestive of development of a more aggressive lesion in this location. 2. Persistent changes attributable to radiation therapy in the right upper lobe, but with decreased in similar changes in the right lower lobe. 3. Increased prominence of the interstitium in both lower lobes which appears to represent fibrotic lung disease. 4. Scattered small nodules which are slightly more prominent than previously.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy  Miller
IMPRESSION:  1.  Semisolid nodule in the left upper lobe stable in size compared to 3/13/13, progressed significantly since 8/6/10 as described above, consistent with low-grade adenocarcinoma  2.  Stable appearance of the treated mass in the right upper lobe  3.  Increased right pleural effusion with new loculated pleural fluid within the lower right major fissure  4.  Stable moderate upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema  5.  Findings in the lower lobes related to aspiration versus other airways disease. Increasing nodular densities in the right lower lobe may be related to infection/aspiration less likely pulmonary nodules/metastases. These should be reassessed on a followup study in 6-8 weeks.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Killam, MD
Impression:  1. Interval enlargement of the nodular component of a part solid left upper lobe pulmonary nodule as described above which is suspicious for tumor enlargement.  2. Stable masslike mildly prior FDG avid right upper lobe consolidation as described above.  3. New curvilinear nodular opacity present within the anterolateral right lower lobe. There is more mass effect than would be expected in the setting of scarring. This favors an infectious/inflammatory in etiology, less likely malignant. Short interval follow-up is recommended.   The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result.   Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. The groundglass component of a mixed density left upper lobe nodule slightly smaller, but also slightly denser than on prior study although the completely solid, inferior component of the lesion has not significantly changed. The changing character of the more superior portion of the lesion may be indicative of increasing malignancy. 2. New irregular nodules in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe are nonspecific and could represent new primary neoplasms given patient's history of multiple primary lung cancers. However, an infectious/inflammatory process cannot be excluded. Close follow-up as per oncology protocol is recommended. 3. No significant interval change in the right upper lobe irregular masslike consolidation. 4. Interval decrease in size of a previously seen irregular density in the right lower lobe is suggestive of an infectious/inflammatory etiology.  Reported By:  Devrim Ersahin, MD  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
IMPRESSION:   1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Numerous irregular appearing nodules, some of which have decreased in size when compared with the prior study, although several which are new, including clustered subcentimeter nodules in the left upper lobe.

IMPRESSION:   High-grade stenosis at origin of celiac axis and moderate stenosis at superior mesenteric artery just after origin. Very small artery possibly represents small inferior mesenteric artery or could represent small collateral vessel. This study was not performed as dedicated CT angiogram and thus degree of stenosis could be over or underestimated.  Common bile duct is dilated to 1.5 cm moderate hepatic duct dilation and gallbladder enlarged to 10 cm slightly due to the biliary dilation. The common bile duct tapers at the low head of the pancreas to the ampulla Vater with no cause of the ovary dilation seen. Anterior stenosis or a small ampullary lesion could cause the biliary dilation.  There is pancreas divisum abnormality with a normal variant however can predispose to pancreatitis.  There are a few small cysts in the pancreas measuring up to 4 mm likely representing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Based on the recommendations of the Managing Incidental Findings on Abdominal CT: White Paper of the ACR Incidental Findings Committee these could be amenable to interval imaging followup in one year to ensure stability.  Infrarenal abdominal aorta aneurysm measured 4.1 cm.  Dilation of ascending aorta up to 4.1 cm.  Moderate emphysema.  Small lung nodules measuring up to 5 mm. Based on the recommendations of the Fleischner Chest Society, if this patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, a follow-up chest CT scan in 6-12 months is recommended.  In the absence of a history of smoking or other risk factor, a follow-up chest CT scan is recommended in 1 year.  If there is a history of malignancy, a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months or as per oncology protocol. At right lung base with slight nodularity likely is subsegmental axis or scarring however because of the nodularity this also could be amenable to interval CT followup to ensure stability.  Findings were discussed with Dr. Antonetti.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD

IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in size of the left pleural effusion. Persistent atelectasis of the left lower lobe; cannot exclude superimposed aspiration/pneumonia.  Unchanged foci of bronchiolitis in the right lung. No new consolidation. Increased small right pleural effusion.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Fibrotic interstitial lung disease and moderate air trapping; CT appearance is inconsistent with UIP pattern. Fibrotic changes have progressed when compared to the older scans from 2011 and 2015 and the right lower lobe fibrotic changes have slightly progressed since April 2016. 2. Interval resolution of previously seen superimposed right upper lobe groundglass opacities. 3. Moderate upper lobe predominant central emphysema. 4. Large Morgagni diaphragmatic hernia. Circumferential wall thickening of the esophagus suggests GERD.  Reported By:  James Gardner, MD  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva

IMPRESSION:  Resolving postsurgical changes from T11-L1 laminectomy. No abscess     Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Killam, MD
Impression:  Loculated right pleural effusion with a possible solid component superiorly. Given the chronic changes which are suggestive of prior asbestos exposure, mesothelioma should be considered.  The findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD
IMPRESSION: A 7.8 x 5.7 thickwalled collection with air-fluid level within the right upper lobe associated with the minor fissure which might represent an intrapleural collection or less likely an intraparenchymal collection.  A tubular opacity within the right upper lobe with associated surrounding groundglass opacities are also noted.  These findings are concerning for infection, although postoperative changes are also a possibility. There is a hydropneumothorax.  Reported By:  Mohammad Samim, MD  Reported And Signed By: Elliott Brown, MD
IMPRESSION:  CT-guided percutaneous right lung abscess with placement of a 10 French locking loop drainage catheter. Approximately with 25 ml of sanguinous fluid were aspirated with a sample sent for culture. The catheter was left connected to a Pleur-evac for drainage.  Reported By: Keith Quencer, MD  Reported And Signed By: Jeffrey Pollak, MD
Impression: 1. Interval placement of right-sided pigtail catheter with decompression of previously seen complicated air/fluid collection in the lateral aspect of the right mid to upper hemithorax, possibly complicated pleural fluid collection associated with the minor fissure rather than reflecting an intraparenchymal lung abscess. 2. Excrescences of soft tissue are again seen extending into the right upper lobe that are nonspecific and of uncertain etiology but possibly adjacent endobronchial spread of infection or could reflect adjacent spread of tumor if pleural neoplasm is present in this patient with history of asbestos exposure. 3. Improving groundglass opacities within the right lung which are nonspecific but likely due to improving areas of infection, inflammation and/or hemorrhage. 4. Postoperative cardiac changes. Pacemaker. Stable ascending aortic aneurysm.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION:  Scattered groundglass opacities in the bilateral lungs, more predominant in the upper lobes. Findings could represent atypical pneumonia or pulmonary edema or pulmonary hemorrhage.

IMPRESSION: 1. Right lower lobe consolidation with internal areas of severely dilated bronchi is most likely related to an infectious process; in the absence of prior chest CTs to assess acuity of these consolidation, a follow-up chest CT (in 6-8 weeks) is recommended to assess for interval improvement after appropriate therapy and exclude potential underlying nodule/mass. 2. Bilateral bronchial wall thickening, ill-defined lung nodules, and clustered airway nodules are likely due to a multifocal infectious process (bronchopneumonia) but the more discrete nodules are indeterminate in the absence of prior CT examinations and should be reassessed on the above recommended follow-up examination to assess for interval improvement/resolution. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, partially loculated on the right. 4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive/related to the parenchymal process and amenable to follow-up. 5. Indeterminate aged wedge compression fractures in the mid to lower thoracic spine.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Indeterminate 7 mm left upper lobe groundglass nodule. This may be infectious/inflammatory in etiology but a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 3 months to assess for interval resolution and exclude potential lesion within the spectrum of lung adenocarcinoma. This nodule does not have the CT appearance of metastatic disease. 2. Several smaller than 4 mm centrilobular nodules in the bilateral upper lobes may be related to respiratory bronchiolitis in this former smoker patient but remain indeterminate in the absence of prior chest CTs to assess long-term stability. Follow-up can be done with CT in 2-3 months or according to patient's oncology protocol.  3. Right axillary soft tissue density with internal fluid component adjacent to surgical clips is likely related to prior axillary node dissection (seroma/hematoma).   Reported By:  Azeem Wasay, DO  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.  Stable 8 mm groundglass nodule in the left upper lobe. Repeat chest CT scan is recommended in one year to assess for interval increase in size and/or density  2.

IMPRESSION:  1.  There is no acute traumatic visceral injury of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.   2.  No acute displaced fracture of the thoracolumbar spine, ribs, clavicles, sternum, scapulae, or pelvic bones are identified.  3.  Bibasilar consolidations possibly represent aspiration.  4.  Findings of metastatic pancreatic cancer, better evaluated on the prior examinations due to lack of intravenous contrast on this examination.   5.  A small volume of simple fluid extending to the pelvis is possibly related to underlying malignancy and is less likely posttraumatic in etiology.

IMPRESSION:   1. Dominant lesion in the right upper lobe is unchanged in the short interval but demonstrates interval growth when compared to CT of the head/C-spine of 7/2014. Of note, an outpatient biopsy demonstrated a necrotizing granuloma and excluded malignancy/TB. Granulomatous polyangiitis has not been excluded. There is no associated adenopathy in the chest. Stable calcified left apical nodule is likely a granuloma.  2. Prominent interventricular septum to be correlated with clinical history of anemia.  3. Thickening and dilatation of the esophagus with a small hiatal hernia. Question esophagitis and bulimia.  4. Hyperdense liver. Is there is a history of iron transfusions? The patient is on cholestyramine. Other less likely considerations include amiodarone therapy.  5. Vertebra plana of T4 and T8 vertebral bodies, with no paraspinal soft tissue mass, stable and better evaluated on an outpatient MRI of the thoracic spine of 11/2015 and new from the total spine MRI of 7/2014. The bones remain diffusely osteopenic.  6. Paucity of subcutaneous fat, which is improved from CT of the abdomen and pelvis 7/2015 and indicative of improving cachexia.

Impression: Stable appearing lungs with groundglass opacities, peripheral interstitial markings, and traction bronchiectasis without definite honeycombing. The pattern is most compatible with fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. There is no predilection for the changes with respect to upper and lower lobes; both are involved relatively equally. Reported By:  Gil   Abramovici,  M.D.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy  Miller, M.D.
Impression: No appreciable interval changes in the pleural based and reticular honeycombing changes with traction bronchiectasis during the last 6 months.

Impression:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Stable pleural-based honeycombing changes with associated bronchiectasis in the bilateral lungs suggestive of fibrotic NSIP. There is new diffuse associated groundglass opacities which may represent pulmonary edema or infection/inflammation.  Reported And Signed By: Kenneth Baker, MD
Impression:  Unchanged lower lobe predominant subpleural reticulation, architectural distortion and traction bronchiectasis with minimal honeycombing suggesting either fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). These entities can coexist in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease. Underlying pulmonary fibrosis is relatively stable from 10/11/2013 but progressed from earlier 2012 and 2013 studies.  Interval increase in associated groundglass opacities from 10/11/2013. Infection due to underlying viral or atypical etiologies should be excluded first. If infection has been reliably excluded, the other leading differential consideration is an acute interstitial lung disease flare.  Reported By:  Jennifer Wells, MD  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Further worsening of groundglass opacity in both lungs, now nearly confluent in the lower lobes, and more patchy in the upper lobes. This is superimposed on the changes of known chronic interstitial lung disease with interstitial thickening, bronchiectasis, and peripheral fibrosis with a basilar predominance. As reported on prior exams, the worsening groundglass opacity could be due to an acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease or a superimposed infectious process.  Reported And Signed By: Jennifer Kim, MD
Impression: No evidence of a pulmonary embolism or other acute pulmonary process.  Reported And Signed By: Michael Rolen, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.Right lower lobe segmental pulmonary artery embolism. Acuity is indeterminate. The linear configuration and lack of filling of the vessel suggest that it may not be acute although it is centrally located unlike chronic emboli which tend to be more eccentric.  2.Basilar atelectasis and Sub-4 mm nodule consistent with a fissural lymph node.   The findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Red critical result.  Reported By:  Douglas Silin, MD  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD

IMPRESSION:  Residual postinflammatory changes right upper and right middle lobe. Significant improvement of airspace consolidation following therapy. Status post mitral valve replacement. Surgical clips and scarring right breast and axilla.    Reported And Signed By: Paul Aiello, MD
Impression:  Bilateral lung nodules measuring up to 11 mm in maximal diameter. Metastatic disease versus granulomatous disease could explain these findings and radiographically lung, it is not possible to differentiate from the possibilities.  Recommendation:   It would be helpful if the patient has any previous CT studies. In the absence, short-term follow-up and correlation with clinical history specifically any current or past history of malignancy would be helpful.  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.  11 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is increased in size compared to 2011 where it measured 7 mm. While the slow growth pattern suggests a benign etiology, a slow-growing malignancy such as a peripheral carcinoid cannot be excluded. A PET scan or biopsy can be considered, though this is borderline in size for resolution of a PET scan and may thus decrease its sensitivity.    2.  Multiple bilateral subcentimeter pulmonary nodules stable from 6/5/2014.   Reported By:  Kaitlin Eng, MD  Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD
IMPRESSION: Expected postsurgical changes of a left lower lobe wedge resection for biopsy-proven neuroendocrine carcinoma as described above.

IMPRESSION: 1.  Evaluation of the lungs is limited due to motion artifact; within these limitations, bilateral lower lobe groundglass opacities may represent pulmonary contusion versus aspiration, less likely infectious in etiology. Correlate with clinical picture and labs. 2.  No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis. 3.  No acute fracture of the thoracic or lumbar spine.  Report Initiated By:  Nishita Parmar, MD  Reported And Signed By: Susan Marlatt, MD
Impression:  1. Left lower lobe consolidation appears inflammatory/infectious in nature but continued radiographic follow-up is suggested. If this persists, bronchoscopy may be considered. 2. Plaque-like consolidation medially in the right lower lobe of uncertain significance, also possibly inflammatory in nature but as this is difficult to follow radiographically, I would recommend noncontrast CT follow-up in 3-6 months.

New adenopathy in the right lower neck and bilateral axillary regions with small but increasingly prominent intrathoracic lymph nodes. These are nonspecific but can be seen in the setting of malignancy (such as lymphoma, metastases), secondary to connective tissue disorder, or HIV, among other possible etiologies. Suggest correlation with tissue sampling. 4. New small left lower lobe nodules measuring up to 4 mm in size which could be further evaluated with follow-up imaging in 6 months. 5. Calcific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Dense aortic valve calcifications which may be correlated with echocardiography to evaluate for aortic stenosis.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse groundglass opacities throughout both lungs with mosaic pattern primarily basilar and evidence of air trapping. This in association with multiple cysts thin-walled primarily basilar raises the possibility of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. This may be seen usually with Sjogren syndrome but also with autoimmune thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, HIV disease and autoimmune syndromes. The air trapping is against a mosaic pattern on the basis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. PICC morning the cysts, another possibility would be hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  2. Focal patchy opacities in the middle lobe and lingula nonspecific and may be inflammatory in origin. 3. The cyst as isolated findings are not typical of LAM, tuberous sclerosis, lung as histiocytosis or of pseudocystic disease. 4.

The appearance is most suggestive of subacute to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis--please correlate with exposure history. 2. Cystic lung disease again seen with lower lobe predominant cysts. These are nonspecific but the main differential diagnostic considerations would include lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) versus Birt-Hogg-Dube in the appropriate clinical setting. 3. Mild bronchial wall thickening, small amount of mucus plugging, and moderate to severe air-trapping. No evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. 4. Calcific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Interval progression of a metastatic lesion medially in the right lobe of the liver and questionable lesion in the lateral segment left lobe.  Reported And Signed By: William Friedman, MD
IMPRESSION:  New mild to moderate wall thickening and enhancement throughout colon is suspicious for colitis.  Worsening fatty infiltration of the liver. This makes assessment of changes in metastatic disease difficult on CT. There is possible new 1.5 cm lesion adjacent to right portal vein. There is 5 cm area of low attenuation medially in right lobe including where 1.4 cm lesion was seen previously however this more likely is due to fatty infiltration than enlargement of this previously seen lesion. MR is a much more accurate method to assess for changes in possible metastatic disease in the liver in the setting of fatty infiltration.  Pancreatic mass is unchanged size however the length of occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein appears slightly longer than on the prior examination.  The critical findings described above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Yellow critical result  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD

Marked worsening of ascites with very large amount ascites now seen throughout abdomen and pelvis. Increased stranding throughout omental fat is suspicious for omental tumor, however there is generalized anasarca and thus this could represent edema rather than tumor involvement.  Severe fatty infiltration of liver is again seen however there is increased heterogeneity of enhancement of the liver suspicious for worsening metastatic disease. New multiple focal areas of peripheral biliary dilation also are suspicious for metastatic disease resulting in areas of peripheral biliary dilation. The possibility of metastatic disease in the liver could be more accurately assessed with MRI without and with intravenous contrast if clinical indicated.  Slightly enlarged 1.1 cm short axis celiac lymph node is increased from 0.9 cm.  New dilation of the gallbladder to over 10 cm length.  Thrombosis of superior mesenteric vein is again seen.

It is nonspecific but could be due to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic granuloma, respiratory bronchiolitis, or perhaps postinfectious granulomata.  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick, MD
IMPRESSION:  Mild to moderate air trapping consistent with small airways disease in this patient with asthma. Hepatic steatosis.    Reported And Signed By: Irena Tocino, MD
Impression: Findings most compatible with multifocal pneumonia.   Right hilar prominence is accounted for by right lower lobe airspace consolidation, a nonenlarged right pulmonary artery and a third soft tissue density which cannot be characterized due to the lack of intravenous contrast. Given the prominent lower paratracheal and AP window lymph nodes, it is likely that this is reactive right hilar adenopathy but an underlying mass cannot be excluded. It is recommended that after the patient's acute infectious process is treated, a repeat chest radiograph or contrast enhanced chest CT be performed for further evaluation.

  Mild emphysema. Diffuse bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lobes with extensive mucoid impaction of segmental bronchi of the bilateral lower lobes and widespread small airway impaction. Clustered nodular groundglass opacities in the dependent right upper lobe and in the superior segment of right lower lobe, likely also secondary to impacted airways. Multiple more discrete nodules measuring up to 8.5 mm in the right lung, difficult to evaluate amidst the innumerable right lung nodularities. Follow-up in 3 months is recommended for further evaluation.     Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD

IMPRESSION:  Very severe emphysema again seen without change.  There are a few scattered small lung nodules measuring up to 4 mm that were not seen previously. These could be amenable to interval follow-up in 6-12 months if clinically indicated.   Very mild peripheral posterior basilar ground glass parenchymal disease greater on the right is slightly increased compared to 2015 with this most likely a manifestation of the emphysema possibly due to subsegmental atelectasis.  Severe fatty infiltration of liver.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD

IMPRESSION:  1.Stable examination status post right upper lobectomy with focal areas of right-sided pleural thickening with some degree of convergence of vascular markings toward these suggestive of foci of rounded atelectasis. These are not at all worrisome for malignancy.  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
Impression: 1. Inflammatory nodules, focal groundglass opacity and consolidation present within bilateral upper lobes. These are presumably infectious in etiology. Given immunosuppression, atypical and fungal etiologies should be entertained.  2. Bronchiectasis with bronchial wall thickening and focal plugging present within the anterior left upper lobe and the right middle lobe. These findings may be post infectious in etiology or a direct result of Crohn's disease as bronchiectasis and bronchial inflammation is a known intrathoracic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease.  The critical findings above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as an Orange critical result.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD
Impression:  1. Nondiagnostic scan for pulmonary embolus due to suboptimal bolus timing. Consider obtaining d-dimer. If clinical concern remains for pulmonary embolus consider repeat CTA examination.  2. Scattered areas of reticular groundglass opacities which are nonspecific but may be reactive small airways disease versus viral in etiology.  The critical findings described above were communicated verbally with Dr. Aydin and tracked via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as a Green (verbal communication) critical result.

  Consolidative opacities in the right upper lobe and superior segment of right lower lobe. Although these may simply represent pneumonia; the widespread miliary sized calcified and noncalcified nodules including the areas of consolidation may add the possibility of metastatic calcification to the differential list in the setting of end-stage renal disease and renal transplant.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD
  Several of the consolidations seen on the prior study from one month prior have decreased in size or resolved however there is a large new consolidation in the left lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:  Complete atelectasis of the bilateral lower lobes, with subsegmental lower lobe bronchial impaction.  Additional scattered nodular opacities as described with associated bronchial wall thickening are suggestive of infection/inflammation, however aspiration is considered, especially given the patient's clinical setting.  Reported By:  Kirsten Cooper, MD  Reported And Signed By: Howard Forman, MD
 Middle lobe and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumonic consolidation or pulmonary edema. Stable 5 mm right upper lobe subpleural nodule since February 2019 and is therefore considered benign. No new or enlarging lung nodules.  No thoracic adenopathy by size criteria. Stable enlarged and heterogeneous left thyroid lobe, could be further assessed by thyroid ultrasound if not already done.  Enlarged central pulmonary artery, may suggest pulmonary artery hypertension  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD    Yale Radiology and Biomedical Imaging 
Impression:   Unremarkable study  Reported And Signed By: Gary Novick, MD 
IMPRESSION:  2 8 mm groundglass nodules without interval change. Continued CT follow-up in one year is suggested to ensure continued stability.  Moderate to severe coronary artery calcification consistent with arteriosclerosis.  Reported And Signed By: Thomas McCauley, MD 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or other acute thoracic disease.  Hypodense 0.2 cm nodule in left lobe of thyroid gland. A follow-up ultrasound examination on a nonemergent basis can be obtained if clinically desired.  Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD 
IMPRESSION: There is no lesion to correspond with the density which was seen on the plain radiographs from one day previously. It is likely that the questioned abnormality on the plain film had represented a confluence of shadows. No follow-up is needed.          Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION: Mild asymmetric dermal thickening in the posterior left parasagittal region at approximately T6-T7, corresponding to the region of concern. No large abscess or extension to  the deep tissues identified.   Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD

Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is nonspecific but suggests pulmonary hypertension. 2. Ascending aorta aneurysm measuring up to 4 cm transverse diameter. Mild coronary artery calcification. Mild cardiomegaly. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Nonspecific scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm. These nodules are nonspecific and may be post infectious or inflammatory in etiology but in the absence of prior examinations to assess long term stability these nodules remain indeterminate and should be followed according to the Fleischner Society guidelines. Follow-up recommendations according to the Fleischner Society for incidentally found pulmonary nodules measuring <=4 mm: low Risk Patient (Minimal or no smoking or other known risk factors for malignancy): No follow-up needed; high Risk Patient (History of smoking or other known risk factors): follow-up at 12 months; if unchanged, no further follow-up. If the patient has known malignancy followup is recommended in 2-3 months or according to patient's oncology protocol. 5. Peripherally calcified fatty lesion in the left adrenal may represent an adrenal myelolipoma although the peripheral calcifications would be an unusual feature. This lesion is partially imaged therefore further evaluation with contrast enhanced abdominal cross sectional imaging (CT or MRI) is recommended.  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva 
IMPRESSION:   1. No pulmonary embolus.  2. Moderate right, and small left, pleural effusions.  3. Cardiomegaly.    Reported And Signed By: Melissa Davis, MD

IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal thickening of the distal esophagus to the level of the EG junction due to neoplasm is similar to slightly improved compared with the most recent prior exam but has improved compared with 2/2020 CT. 2. New ill-defined nodular areas of consolidation in the paramediastinal right lower lobe are suspected to be related to radiation therapy. 3. New consolidation in the left lower lobe posteriorly which likely reflects atelectasis unless there is clinical suspicion for aspiration/pneumonia. 4. Stable small nonspecific lung nodules and subcentimeter lymph nodes for which continued follow-up is recommended in 3-6 months or as per oncology protocol.  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD

Centimeter and subcentimeter left supraclavicular and paraesophageal nodes, amenable to follow up.  Moderate right pleural effusion.  Clustered and tree-in-bud groundglass nodules may represent aspiration in this clinical context. Otherwise limited parenchymal evaluation.    Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD
  No acute intrathoracic abnormality.  Sub-6 mm pulmonary nodules for which follow-up chest CT can be obtained in 12 months if there are risk factors for lung cancer.

IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of metastatic disease to the thorax. 2. New patchy groundglass opacities and suggestion of minimal fibrotic changes in the left upper lobe. Findings are suggestive of noninfectious lung inflammation (such as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia/NSIP or organizing pneumonia/OP). Correlate clinically to exclude possibility of underlying connective tissue disorder or  secondary to drug toxicity, among other etiologies. 3.  Prominent/dilated thoracic duct of uncertain etiology/significance. This could be further evaluated with a lymphangiogram if clinically warranted. 4. Increasing splenomegaly.

IMPRESSION: Stable exam. Status post coil embolization of numerous right middle and bilateral lower lobe arteriovenous malformations. Additional small bilateral AVMs, as described above, unchanged since 2016.      Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.Pattern of interstitial lung disease which is inconsistent with UIP. The basilar predominance and traction bronchiectasis with mild air trapping suggest nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. The mosaic attenuation which is accentuated on expiratory images suggests that there may be a contributing factor of small airways disease.  2.Punctate calcifications along the pleural surfaces suggestive of asbestos exposure but not nearly as dramatic as is seen in many patients with this exposure.  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION:  1. The pattern of interstitial lung disease does not appear significantly changed from the prior. Again it is inconsistent with UIP given the degree of air trapping and lack of honeycombing. It is characterized by basilar predominant traction bronchiectasis and multi lobar air trapping.   2. Small foci of calcification along the pleural surface which may be indicative of the patient's known asbestos exposure. 3. Moderate coronary artery calcification. 4. Adrenal thickening and focal fat-containing lesion compatible with adenomatous change.   Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with fibrotic interstitial lung disease including reticulations and traction bronchiectasis  without honeycombing.  These findings have a lower lobe and peripheral distribution.  There is a significant amount of air trapping, mild associated groundglass, and dendriform calcifications. Given given the air trapping and calcifications, these findings are indeterminate for a UIP pattern of interstitial lung disease per the 2018 American Thoracic Society criteria. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a consideration.  These findings have progressed compared with the most recent study from December 2016 and compared with the earliest available imaging from March 2009.

IMPRESSION: Acute pulmonary emboli extending from the right and left main pulmonary artery branchpoints into the segmental branches.  Reflux of contrast into the IVC, and mild flattening of the interventricular septum is concerning for possible right heart strain, for which clinical correlation is recommended for symptomatology/hypotension.  Scattered groundglass opacities predominating in the left lung apex, may be related to shunting and hypoperfusion given presence of emboli.  These results were communicated to Dr. Andrew Pickens at 12:51 PM on 12/22/2020.  Report Initiated By:  Anne Sailer, MD  Reported And Signed By: Trilochan Hiremath, MD

Critical findings were communicated with Dr. Emmanuel Ohuabunwa at 11:15 PM.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Mezrich, MD
IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. There is increasing consolidation in the left lower lobe dependently consistent with aspiration. The patient's esophagus is dilated and fluid-filled throughout the thorax which places the patient high risk for aspiration.  3. Multiple fractures consistent with prior trauma including fractures of the right scapula, right spinal transverse processes, in the right ribs. Several of the ribs are broken in multiple places which can cause flail chest physiology and likely represents the cause of the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath.  Reported And Signed By: Christopher Gange
Impression: 1. Multiple indeterminate lung nodules, largest measuring 9 mm in the left lower lobe. A follow-up chest CT is recommended (in 3 months) to document stability. 2.

Cholelithiasis.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Killam, MD 
IMPRESSION: Subpleural (and to a lesser degree bronchovascular) pulmonary fibrosis with a diffuse mosaic attenuation pattern or air trapping which is unchanged from prior study. These findings may be related to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Imaging findings are inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia. There is no superimposed groundglass opacity to suggest an ILD flare.  Previously described subpleural opacity noted in the right upper lobe has decreased from the prior study suggesting that may be inflammatory/infectious in etiology.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Stable fibrotic interstitial lung disease and air trapping; the main diagnostic consideration remains chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.  2. Interval resolution of previously seen right upper lobe focus of infectious/inflammation. No new airspace opacities.  3. Stable benign nodules, as detailed. No new nodules. 4.

IMPRESSION:  Multiple irregular bladder masses consistent with history of bladder tumor. Bladder is obscured by streak artifact from right total hip arthroplasty and thus is not well evaluated.  No abnormality visualized the ureters and intrarenal collecting systems.  6 mm right middle lobe lung nodule. Based on the recommendations of the Fleischner Chest Society, if this patient has a history of smoking or other risk factor for lung cancer, a follow-up chest CT scan in 6-12 months is recommended.  In the absence of a history of smoking or other risk factor, a follow-up chest CT scan is recommended in 1 year.  If there is a history of malignancy, a follow-up chest CT is recommended in 2-3 months or as per oncology protocol.    The patient has a lower right kidney extending into the upper pelvis. Because this was not noted by the technologist the lower portion of the kidney was inadvertently not imaged during the nephrographic phase which somewhat limits sensitivity for intrarenal mass at the lower pole however no abnormality is seen on the noncontrast images of the late phase images at the lower pole right kidney.

Mild mucus secretions in the trachea and mainstem bronchi with multiple foci of mucous plugging in the right upper lobe.   3 x 2 cm heterogeneous soft tissue density mass on the left side of the superior mediastinum, could be related to ectopic thyroid tissue or less likely lymph node. Correlation with nuclear imaging or continued evaluation on follow-up studies as per oncology protocol is recommended.  Reported And Signed By: Tarek Elkady, MD
Impression: Multiple clustered nodules are seen in a centrilobular distribution throughout the right lung. These have a pattern which is entirely consistent with infection spread through the small airways. Given the fact that none of these nodules is seen on the left, and that there are secretions within the right mainstem bronchus, I would favor an infectious etiology over spread of malignancy. Additionally, given that these nodules are all quite small and there is not a basilar predominance of nodules are further pieces of evidence that it is more likely that these represent evidence for infection rather than for malignancy. Again post radiation changes are seen in the right paramediastinal distribution.   Reported And Signed By: Cindy  Miller, M.D.

Reported And Signed By: Syed Jamal Bokhari, MD
Impression: Borderline enlargement of the right paratracheal lymph node within normal limits and minimal linear and streaky groundglass opacities in the right upper lobe. No mediastinal mass or congenital anomaly of the great vessels.  Comment: These findings are not conclusive but likely represent previously identified infectious process that has improved in the last 3 weeks.    Reported By:  Jonathan Weisiger, MD  Reported And Signed By: Myung Shin
Impression: 1.   Interval resolution of  groundglass opacity and centrilobular nodules in the right upper lobe, compatible with resolved infectious process. 2. Moderate bronchial wall thickening bilaterally, a finding which can be seen with small airway inflammation such as asthma or bronchitis. 3.  Few scattered pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4 mm, which are stable. Given the patient's age, these nodules are nonspecific but most likely benign especially given evidence of prior granulomatous disease and therefore do not require followup (unless there is history of an underlying malignancy).  Reported By:  Jennifer Wells, MD  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
  1. Limited exam for solid organ or vascular trauma without intravenous contrast. Within limitations, no evidence of visceral injury is identified. 2.

IMPRESSION:   1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic pathology.  2. Findings consistent with worsened interstitial lung disease possibly representing fibrotic NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia) versus  early UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia) pattern with superimposed edema. In addition infectious bronchiolitis/pneumonitis in the right upper lobe is also suspected.  Reported By:  Nakul Sheth, MD  Reported And Signed By: Syed Jamal Bokhari, MD
Impression: No evidence of hollow viscus perforation. Markedly limited, essentially nondiagnostic evaluation of the abdomen due to streak artifact from barium present throughout the colon.  Reported And Signed By: Krithica Kaliannan, MD
IMPRESSION:  Again seen is peripheral based increased reticular markings with associated honeycombing, groundglass, and mild air trapping; predominantly in the upper lobes. UIP is effectively excluded given the upper lobe predominance, groundglass, and foci of air trapping.  Reported By:  Ezra Detroy, MD  Reported And Signed By: Anne Curtis, MD
IMPRESSION:  1.Compared with the examination of nearly 2 years previously, there is a similar distribution of fibrotic changes with upper lobe predominance of honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. There are small foci of hyperlucency which demonstrated evidence of air trapping as well as larger areas of air trapping in the right middle lobe and anterobasal segment of the left lower lobe. As previously, the pattern is inconsistent with that of UIP, and in some locations, there is the suggestion of there being 3 separate densities as might be seen with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. If this indeed represents hypersensitivity pneumonitis, this would represent chronic disease.  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further recommendations  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Continued interval progression of upper lobe predominant fibrotic interstitial lung disease inconsistent with a UIP pattern. Would favor chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis although fibrotic NSIP is also possible. 2. Mildly enlarged central pulmonary arteries which can be seen with pulmonary hypertension. 3. Nonspecific intrathoracic lymphadenopathy not significantly changed from most recent prior exam but slightly increased compared with older prior studies.   Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD 
IMPRESSION: Upper lobe predominant fibrotic interstitial lung disease with appearance inconsistent with UIP pattern is unchanged from recent prior CT. New subtle groundglass opacities diffuse bilaterally with differential diagnosis including ILD exacerbation, mild inflammation, and infection. Pulmonary edema is thought to be less likely.   Reported By:  Manijeh Zehtabchi, MD  Reported And Signed By: Isabel Oliva Cortopassi, MD

Impression: 1. Status post right lung transplant, without CT evidence of acute infection/inflammation. 2. Stable honeycombing in the left lung consistent with ILD. Stable left upper lobe nodule.  Reported And Signed By: Balaji Rao, MD
IMPRESSION: 1. New diffuse mid to lower lung predominant right lung centrilobular nodules compatible with infectious/inflammatory bronchiolitis. This is more than would be expected in the setting of chronic aspiration though this may be contributory. Atelectasis and consolidation is present at the right lung base.  2. Right lung geographic air trapping with increased bronchial wall dilation. This may be related to an infectious/inflammatory bronchiolitis described above. It should be noted that in retrospect geographic air trapping was present in the right lung on the prior study suggesting underlying constrictive bronchiolitis (suggesting chronic transplant rejection).  3. 11 mm solid noncalcified pulmonary nodule within the native left lung apex is stable from favoring benignity.    The critical findings above were communicated via the Veriphy Critical Results Reporting System as an Orange critical result.  Reported And Signed By: Demetrius Dicks, MD

Mosaicism of the lung parenchyma with mild bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis; although incompletely evaluated on this CT, constellation of findings raises the possibility of bronchiolitis obliterans. Consider dedicated chest CT with ILD protocol for further characterization if clinically warranted.  Extensive fibrosis of the left lung. Unchanged 8 mm left upper lobe nodule since at least 2014, likely benign.  Infrarenal IVC filter with extraluminal extension of the filter limbs.  Reported And Signed By: Meline Hovnanian, MD

Impression:  1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.  2. Bibasilar patchy lower lobe pulmonary opacities, with multiple fluid-filled lower lobe bronchi, suggestive of aspiration/pneumonia  3. Fat density mass arising the interatrial septum, appears to be unchanged since 2009, which may represent lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.  Reported By:  Michal Nowak, MD  Reported And Signed By: Amit Mahajan, MD 
IMPRESSION:  Large right upper lobe consolidation with surrounding groundglass opacities and new central lucency, are most in favor of an infectious process with early abscess formation.  Extensive surrounding tree-in-bud nodules/patchy groundglass opacities throughout the right middle and upper lobes also favor infectious etiology. Underlying superinfected/necrotic mass is difficult to exclude, but felt less likely when taking all imaging findings into consideration. Nevertheless, close followup after appropriate treatment is recommended to asses for changes.   Enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are most likely reactive.   Reported And Signed By: Guido Santacana-Laffitte, MD 
IMPRESSION: 1. Mild interstitial lung disease with progression since the previous examination.  2. Subcentimeter short axis mediastinal lymph nodes have enlarged since the previous study and may be reactive in nature.  3. Interval enlargement of a moderate-sized hiatal hernia.  4.

IMPRESSION: 1.  Interstitial abnormalities including cystic changes are similar to prior CT with main differential diagnostic considerations including desquamative interstitial pneumonia in patient with smoking history; however connective tissue related interstitial lung disease could have similar appearance.  2.  New ill-defined groundglass nodules are nonspecific but possibly infectious or inflammatory in etiology. Further evaluation with follow-up chest CT in 3-6 months is recommended.  Report Initiated By:  Clifford Shin, MD  Reported And Signed By: Ami Rubinowitz, MD
  Redemonstration of interstitial lung disease with reticulations and peripheral small lung cysts, likely smoking-related interstitial lung disease. Straight images are suboptimal to evaluate for air trapping.  Previously seen groundglass opacities have resolved, likely inflammatory.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  Mild peribronchiolar thickening may represent bronchiolitis/small airways disease..  Reported By:  Junaid Raja, MD  Reported And Signed By: Syed Jamal Bokhari, MD
IMPRESSION:  In addition to the single nodular density which was seen on the plain radiograph of the chest in December, 2014, there are multiple other nodular and tubular densities in the right upper lobe only. The small nodules are compatible with centrilobular nodules associated with small airways infection, and the tubular densities are consistent with mucoid impacted bronchioles.  RECOMMENDATIONS: No further follow-up of these is necessary.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD 
IMPRESSION:     Stable tubular nodular densities in the right upper and right middle lobe since 6-15 and the setting of calcified mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes likely reflect tubular nodular impacted airways. Nevertheless, a repeat chest CT scan in 6 months will complete a two-year surveillance.  Reported And Signed By: Jonathan Killam, MD

Impression: No evidence of a pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Opacity in the right lower lobe likely representing developing consolidation. Clinical correlation is recommended. New 7 mm nodule in the left lower lobe (image 29, series 2) while the other nodules appear stable.  Reported And Signed By: Salomon  Blutreich Attending, M.D.
Impression: 1. Stable appearance of the left lower lobe nodule. The next followup examination for this nodule should be at 6-9 months. 2. Development of new nodular opacity in the left upper lobe which may well be infectious/inflammatory in etiology; however, it is recommended that given the patient's severe emphysematous changes and therefore likely history of tobacco use, followup be obtained according to the Fleischner criteria. Given the fact that this measures greater than 1.2 CM, options would include repeat CT scan in a short interval time or PET scan. However, if this is infectious, it would also demonstrate FDG avidity, and the utility of the PET scan would be significantly reduced. 3. Resolved airspace disease in the right upper lobe, but development of new foci of airspace disease in both lower lobes. As described above, although somewhat nodular in their appearance, these new foci of opacity likely represent evidence of infection.  In summary, because of the patient's underlying severe emphysema, the appearance of infection/inflammation: Erect the be similar to that of malignancy. With respect to the well-defined nodule in the left lower lobe, this requires continued followup as described above. The new nodular opacity in the left upper lobe could well be evidence of infection.  Reported And Signed By: Cindy Miller, MD
