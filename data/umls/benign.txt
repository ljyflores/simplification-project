For neoplasms, a non-infiltrating and non-metastasizing neoplastic process that is characterized by the absence of morphologic features associated with malignancy (e.g., severe atypia, nuclear pleomorphism, tumor cell necrosis, and abnormal mitoses). For other conditions, a process that is mild in nature and not dangerous to health.
