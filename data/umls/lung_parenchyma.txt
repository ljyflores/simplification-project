Tissue consisting of an external serous coat, subserous areolar tissue and lung parenchyma. The parenchyma is made up of lobules wound together by connective tissue. A primary lobule consists of a terminal bronchiole, respiratory bronchioles, and alveolar ducts, which communicate with many alveoli, each alveolus being surrounded by a network of capillary blood vessels.
