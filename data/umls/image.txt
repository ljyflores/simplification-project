<p><b>Description:</b> A characteristic representing a single file reference that contains two or more views of the same dosage form of the product; in most cases this should represent front and back views of the dosage form, but occasionally additional views might be needed in order to capture all of the important physical characteristics of the dosage form. Any imprint and/or symbol should be clearly identifiable, and the viewer should not normally need to rotate the image in order to read it. Images that are submitted with SPL should be included in the same directory as the SPL file.</p>
