A program to spur development of daring technologic improvements in cancer treatment and detection in the 21st century. A five-year, $48 million program which seeks to stimulate development of radically new technologies in cancer care that can transform what is now impossible into the realm of the possible for detecting, diagnosing, and intervening in cancer at its earliest stages of development. The vision of the Unconventional Innovations Program is to couple detection and diagnostic technologies based on remote sensing to far less invasive treatments than those employed today which, though often effective, can be uncomfortable and painful. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide medical care for cancer patients that detects early cellular changes typical of cancer and includes treatments that target molecular alterations from occurring in an individual patient's cells.
