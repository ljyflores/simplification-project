Smooth or roughly undulating margin in which two or more regions of the nodule extend out from the adjacent surface but having a broader base and smoother convexity than serrations. Lobulations may be subtle. If the nodule has lobulations that are serrated or spiculated, it should be classified as serrated/spiculated.
