A measurement of the backward flow of blood through the tricuspid valve during right ventricle contraction. It correlates with pulmonary artery systolic pressure at rest and with exercise. A tricuspid regurgitation velocity greater than or equal to 2.5 m/sec on echocardiography is a surrogate marker for pulmonary hypertension in adults with sickle cell disease.
