Tissue structure disintegration and destruction due to action of endogenous or/and exogenous lytic substances which include but not limited to naturally occurring or laboratory designed proteolytic enzymes, glycosidases, detergents, pore-forming proteins, immune complexes, etc. Tissue lysis plays role in pathogenesis of a number of conditions e.g. protozoal infections, ischemic tissue injury, and autoimmune disorders. It is also used as a basis for non-surgical treatment modality to remove or minimize presence of abnormal tissue, e.g. adhesions.
