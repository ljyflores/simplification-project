In Chinese philosophy, fire (Chinese: 火; pinyin: huǒ) is the prosper of the matter, or the matter's prosperity stage. Fire is the second phase of Wu Xing.
Fire is yang in character. Its motion is upward and its energy is convective.
Fire is associated with Summer, the South, the planet Mars, the color red (associated with extreme luck), hot weather, daylight, and the Vermilion Bird (Zhu Que) in the Four Symbols.
