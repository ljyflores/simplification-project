Rory is a given name of Gaelic origin. It is an anglicisation of the Irish: Ruairí/Ruaidhrí and  Scottish Gaelic: Ruairidh and is common to the Irish, Highland Scots and their diasporas. The meaning of the name is "red king", composed of ruadh ("red-haired") and rígh ("king").
In Ireland and Scotland, it is generally seen as a masculine name and therefore rarely given to females.
