Muret (French pronunciation: [myʁɛ] (listen); in Gascon Occitan Murèth) is a commune in the Haute-Garonne department, of which it is a subprefecture, in the Occitanie region of southwestern France. Its inhabitants are called Muretains.
It is an outer suburb of the city of Toulouse, even though it is not in the region of Toulouse Métropole, which it has declined to join. It lies southwest of Toulouse and is the largest component of the intercommunality of Le Muretain Agglo.
Muret is generally known for the Battle of Muret (1213) and as the birthplace of the Renaissance humanist Muretus (1526-1585) and of Clément Ader (1841-1925), inventor and aviation pioneer. It is also the birthplace of the Niel family from which Adolphe Niel, Marshal of France and Minister of War, was derived.
