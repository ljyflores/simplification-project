The Negro Rebellion (Spanish: Levantamiento Armado de los Independientes de Color), "Armed Uprising of the Independents of Color," also known as the Little Race War, the War of 1912, or The Twelve was a series of protests and uprisings in 1912 in Cuba, which saw conflict between Afro-Cuban rebels and the armed forces of Cuba. It took place mainly in the eastern region of the island where most Afro-Cubans were employed. After a weeks of fighting, including massacres of Afro-Cubans by the Cuban National Army led by General Jesus Monteagudo and a U.S. military intervention to protect American companies, the rebellion was put to an end. The leaders of Afro-Cuban rebels, Evaristo Estenoz and Pedro Ivonnet, were killed during the rebellion and their political movement, the Independent Party of Color was dissolved. Between 3,000 and 6,000 people were killed in the rebellion.
