The Spanish Renaissance was a movement in Spain, emerging from the Italian Renaissance in Italy during the 14th century, that spread to Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries.
This new focus in art, literature,
quotes and science inspired by the Greco-Roman tradition of Classical antiquity, received a major impulse from several events in 1492:

Unification of the longed-for Christian kingdom with the definitive taking of Granada, the last Islamic controlled territory in the Iberian Peninsula, and the successive expulsions of thousands of Muslim and Jewish believers,
The official discovery of the western hemisphere, the Americas,
The publication of the first grammar of a vernacular European language in print, the Gram√°tica (Grammar) by Antonio de Nebrija.
