Meherabad (meher meaning "friend" from Iranian "Mihir", ultimately from Old Persian "Mithra"; abad meaning a prosperous settlement, or a flourishing colony) was originally an ashram established by Meher Baba near Arangaon village, India in 1923 about 9 kilometres (6 mi) south of Ahmednagar. It is now the site of Meher Baba's samadhi (shrine/tomb) as well as facilities and accommodations for pilgrims. Many buildings mostly associated with the earlier decades of Babaâ€™s work, the graves of disciples, and a range of pilgrim accommodation and charitable establishments are also there. Many Baba-followers work or live in the vicinity. There are also some public dispensaries and schools.
Established in May 1923, Meherabad was the first permanent residence of Meher Baba and his disciples in Ahmednagar district. In 1944, Meher Baba moved his residence north to Meherabad, located 24 kilometres (15 mi) away on the other side of Ahmednagar.Meher Pilgrim Center (also spelled "Centre") is the central administrative facility for the Meher Baba pilgrim retreat. The Pilgrim Center and Pilgrim Retreat are closed during the hot Indian summer from 15 March to 15 June of each year. On 15 June 2006, new pilgrim facilities were established with the construction of Meher Pilgrim Retreat, an 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) facility.
