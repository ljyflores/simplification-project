In professional boxing, the undisputed champion of a weight class is the boxer who holds world titles from all of the major sanctioning organisations simultaneously. There are currently four major sanctioning bodies: WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO. There were many undisputed champions before the number of major sanctioning bodies increased to four in 2007, but there have only been 13 boxers to hold all four titles simultaneously. As of January 2023, Canelo √Ålvarez, Jermell Charlo and Devin Haney are undisputed champions in the super middleweight, light middleweight and lightweight divisions respectively.
