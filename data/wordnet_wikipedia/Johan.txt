Johann, typically a male given name, is the German form of Iohannes, which is the Latin form of the Greek name Iōánnēs (Ἰωάννης), itself derived from Hebrew name Yochanan (יוֹחָנָן‎) in turn from its extended form Yehochanan (יְהוֹחָנָן‎), meaning "Yahweh is Gracious" or "Yahweh is Merciful". Its English language equivalent is John. It is uncommon as a surname.
