The North Sydney Bears is an Australian rugby league football club based in North Sydney, New South Wales. The club competes in the New South Wales Cup, having exited the National Rugby League following the 1999 NRL season after 90 years in the premier rugby league competition in Australia. North Sydney is based on Sydney's Lower North Shore, and has played at North Sydney Oval since 1910. There have been on-going bids to resurrect the club in the NRL as either The Bears, based in Perth and Sydney, or as the Central Coast Bears, based at Gosford.The club was established in 1908, making it one of the original founding members of the New South Wales Rugby Football League, and one of Australia's first rugby league football clubs. North Sydney continued competing with some success in the first half of the 20th century in the NSWRL, and through the ARL and NRL premierships until the club merged with Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles to form the Northern Eagles for the 2000 season. The merged club lasted only until 2002 when it split again, with the Bears not returning to first grade and being represented in the NSWRL competition, the second-tier rugby league competition, where the Bears continue to play today.
North Sydney was in a partnership with South Sydney serving as Souths' reserve grade side from 2007 until the agreement ended in 2018.  In total, 247 players who had been affiliated with Souths played with Norths in The Intrust Super Premiership NSW. Until the end of season 2009, Souths were coached by the Bears' record-breaking top points scorer, Jason Taylor.  In September 2018, North Sydney announced that it had signed a 5-year deal to become the Sydney Roosters feeder club and reserve grade side with Taylor returning to the club as head coach.
