The WWE Divas Championship was a women's professional wrestling world championship in WWE. The championship was created by WWE in 2008, and was introduced as part of the WWE brand extension via a storyline by then SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero as an alternative to Raw's WWE Women's Championship.Michelle McCool became the inaugural champion on July 20, 2008, when she defeated Natalya at The Great American Bash. After then-WWE Divas Champion Maryse was drafted to Raw as part of the 2009 WWE draft, she took the title with her. McCool won a match against Melina to unify the WWE Divas and Women's titles at the Night of Champions pay-per-view on September 19, 2010, creating the Unified WWE Divas Championship;  it eventually dropped the "Unified" moniker. The youngest woman to win the Divas Championship is Paige, at age 21.
The title was retired in 2016 at WrestleMania 32, after WWE Hall of Famer Lita revealed a brand-new Women's Championship, which would later be called the Raw Women's Championship, to replace the Divas Championship. The match for the new title took place at the event between the reigning Divas Champion Charlotte Flair and her opponents Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks in a triple threat match. Therefore, Charlotte Flair was the last Divas champion.
