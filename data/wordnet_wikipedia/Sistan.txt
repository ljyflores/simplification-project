Sistān (Persian: سیستان), known in ancient times as Sakastān (Persian: سَكاستان, "the land of the Saka"), is a historical and geographical region in present-day Eastern Iran (Sistan and Baluchestan Province) and Southern Afghanistan (Nimruz, Helmand, Kandahar). Largely desert, the region is bisected by the Helmand River, the largest river in Afghanistan, which empties into the Hamun Lake that forms part of the border between the two countries.
