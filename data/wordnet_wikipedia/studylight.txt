Lotan (Hebrew: לוֹטָן‎, Lōṭān), the eldest son of Seir the Horite, was the first-listed of seven chief of the Horites in the land of Seir in Genesis 36. He had two sons, Hori and Hemam. Esau's son Eliphaz married Lotan's sister Timna, who gave birth to Amalek.
The kibbutz Lotan in Israel is named after him.
