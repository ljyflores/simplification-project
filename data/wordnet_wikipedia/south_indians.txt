Indian South Africans are South Africans who descend from indentured labourers and free migrants who arrived from British India during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The majority live in and around the city of Durban, making it one of the largest ethnically Indian-populated cities outside of India.As a consequence of the policies of apartheid, Indian (synonymous with Asian) is regarded as a race group in South Africa.
