Jeanne Rij-Rousseau (June 10, 1870 â€“ October 22, 1956) was a French Cubist painter and an art theoretician. Her estate has been scattered throughout the world. Paintings are trafficked in N.Y., Chicago, London, and Paris. Some works are in Parisian museums, in Blois, and in Grenoble, but especially in private collectors' homes. Research on this painter of the French Modern Age is still in its beginnings.
