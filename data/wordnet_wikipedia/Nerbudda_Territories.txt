The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories, was a region of British India, located in the central part of present-day Madhya Pradesh state in central India. It included the present-day districts of Sagar (Saugor), Damoh, Jabalpur, and Narsinghpur.
The region extended on either side of the Narmada River (Nerbudda). Jubbulpore (now pronounced 'Jabalpur') was the capital and the military headquarters of the territory. The city was one of the candidates for the administrative capital of British India, when the Government decided to move the capital outside Calcutta in 1911.
