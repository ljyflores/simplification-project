McDonald's Restaurants of Canada, Limited (French: Les Restaurants McDonald's du Canada Limitée) is the Canadian master franchise of the fast food restaurant chain McDonald's, owned by the American parent McDonald's Corporation. One of Canada's largest fast-food restaurant chains, the franchise sells food items, including hamburgers, chicken, French fries and soft drinks all across the country. McDonald's is known for its high fat and calorie foods, but it also has alternatives such as salads, juice and milk. McDonald's was Canada's largest food service operator before being overtaken by Tim Hortons in 2005. The slogans used in Canada are "i'm lovin' it" in English and "c'est ça que j'm" in French.
McDonald's Canadian operations are based in Don Mills in North York, Toronto. The current McDonald's Canada President is Jacques Mignault.
McDonald's Canadian logo is identified with the local red maple leaf placed in the company's golden arches.
