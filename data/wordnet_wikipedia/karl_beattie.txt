Most Haunted is a British television programme based on investigating purported paranormal activity produced by Antix Productions and was for satellite and cable channels Sky Living/LivingTV. Series 16 and onwards have been aired on the Freeview channel Really. The beginning of series 16 was shown online before other episodes for the series were broadcast on television. The following is a list of episodes and locations for the series since it began in 2002.
During its broadcast on LivingTV, Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders was not counted towards the then existing series count. LivingTV then labelled the 2008 as Series 10 up until their final series which they regarded as series 14. This is reflected in DVD and syndicated streaming releases of those series. Producer and Director Karl Beattie clarified in a Tweet that he considers Midsummer Murders a Most Haunted series and the first series broadcast by Really as Series 16. In the Tweet he refers to the upcoming 2017 series as Series 21. For clarity this list reflects this numbering system. Most Haunted Live! and Most Haunted Extra episodes are not included in this list.
