Zheng Chenggong, Prince of Yanping (Chinese: 鄭成功; pinyin: Zhèng Chénggōng; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tīⁿ Sêng-kong; 27 August 1624 – 23 June 1662), better known internationally as Koxinga (Chinese: 國姓爺; pinyin: Guóxìngyé; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Kok-sìng-iâ), was a Ming loyalist general who resisted the Qing conquest of China in the 17th century, fighting them on China's southeastern coast.
In 1661, Koxinga defeated the Dutch outposts on Taiwan and established a dynasty, the House of Koxinga, which ruled part of the island as the Kingdom of Tungning from 1661 to 1683.
