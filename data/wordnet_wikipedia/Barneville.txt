Barneville-Carteret (French pronunciation: ​[baʁnəvil kaʁtʁɛ]) is a commune in the Manche department in the Normandy region of north-western France. For many years it has been a popular seaside resort destination.
The commune resulted from a merger of two communes in 1964: Barneville-sur-Mer and Carteret whose port has ferry connections to the Channel Islands.
The inhabitants of the commune are known as Barnevillais or Barnevillaises and Carteretais or Carteretaises.
