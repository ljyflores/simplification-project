SummerSlam is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, produced annually since 1988 by WWE, the world's largest professional wrestling promotion. Dubbed "The Biggest Party of the Summer", it is considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind their flagship event, WrestleMania. It is also considered one of the company's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the "Big Five". In addition to PPV since 1988, the event has aired on the WWE Network since 2014 and Peacock since 2021.
The inaugural SummerSlam took place on August 29, 1988, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. From 2009 to 2014, SummerSlam was held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and from 2015 to 2018, the event took place at the Barclays Center in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. From its inception up through the 2021 event, SummerSlam was held annually in August. The 2022 SummerSlam marked the first and thus far only time that the event was not held in August, as it was instead held in July, with the event returning to August in 2023.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, that year's SummerSlam was WWE's first PPV produced from their bio-secure bubble, the WWE ThunderDome. After the promotion resumed live touring with fans in July 2021, that year's SummerSlam was promoted as the "biggest event of 2021" due to WrestleMania 37 having to be held at a reduced venue capacity. In turn, the 2021 SummerSlam became the highest-grossing SummerSlam event of all time.
