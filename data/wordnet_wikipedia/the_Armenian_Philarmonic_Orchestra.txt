A concert hall is a cultural building with a stage that serves as a performance venue and an auditorium filled with seats.
This list does not include other venues such as sports stadia, dramatic theatres or convention centres that may occasionally be used for concerts.

The list is organised alphabetically by geo-political region or continent and then by country within each region.
