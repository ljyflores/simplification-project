The Preuss School, Preuss School UCSD, or Preuss Model School  is a coeducational college-preparatory charter day school established on a $14 million campus situated on the University of California San Diego (UCSD) campus in La Jolla, California, United States. The school was named in recognition of a gift from the Preuss Family Foundation and is chartered under the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD).Founded in 1999 in the wake of passage of California Proposition 209, Preuss uses an intensive college preparatory curriculum to educate low-income students between sixth and twelfth grades, hoping to improve their historical under-representation on the campuses of the University of California. Criteria for admission include that the student's primary guardian lacks a college education and that the student's family qualifies for federal free- or reduced-price lunches under the National School Lunch Act.The school, which charges no tuition, has received a six-year accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, has been evaluated as a National Blue Ribbon School and a California Distinguished School, and has been named by The Center of Education Reform as one of the top charter schools in America and by the University of Southern California Center for Educational Governance as the top charter school in California. Between 2007 and 2012 Preuss has consistently been listed among the top 50 American high schools by both Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report. Preuss has also been noted for sending a high percentage (96%) of its graduates to four-year universities.
