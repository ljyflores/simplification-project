The Ribbajack & Other Curious Yarns is a fantasy book by Brian Jacques, published in 2004. It was published the same year as Jacques' Rakkety Tam (the 17th book in his better known Redwall fantasy series). There are six tales in this book, all of them like the tales in Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales, by the same author.  The titles are: "The Ribbajack", "A Smile and a Wave", "The All Ireland Champion Versus the Nye Add", "The Mystery of Huma D'Este", "Miggy Mags and the Malabar Sailor", and "Rosie's Pet."
The "Ribba Jack" is also an ancient term for a physical appearance of ones worst fear.  The Ribbajack (in the story) is a grotesque animal that is summoned by a person's anger to kill another.
