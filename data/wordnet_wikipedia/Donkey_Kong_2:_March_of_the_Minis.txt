Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis is a direct sequel to the Game Boy Advance game Mario vs. Donkey Kong released in 2006, which is a follow-up to the Game Boy Donkey Kong game, a partial remake of the original Donkey Kong with a greater focus on puzzle-solving. Gameplay involves the player controlling several Mini Marios with the touch screen, instead of Mario himself. The game also features the return of Pauline, last seen in the 1994 Donkey Kong. A sequel, called Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!, was released in June 2009.
In October 2016, the game was released on the Wii U eShop under the Virtual Console branding.
