"Yours Is My Heart Alone" or "You Are My Heart's Delight" (German: "Dein ist mein ganzes Herz") is an aria from the 1929 operetta The Land of Smiles (Das Land des Lächelns) with music by Franz Lehár and the libretto by Fritz Löhner-Beda and Ludwig Herzer. It was for many years associated with the tenor Richard Tauber, for whom it was written. The aria is sung by the character of Prince Sou-Chong in act 2. An American version of the show opened on Broadway in 1946 starring Tauber but it soon closed as Tauber had throat trouble.The aria has been sung in Italian (as "Tu che m'hai preso il cuor" [You who have taken my heart]) by a few operatic tenors, notably Giuseppe Di Stefano, Mario Del Monaco, and Luciano Pavarotti.
