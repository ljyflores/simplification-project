Stevenage Football Club (known as Stevenage Borough Football Club until 2010) is a professional association football club based in the town of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. The team competes in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system. They play their home games at Broadhall Way in Stevenage.
Founded in 1976 following the demise of the town's former club, they joined the United Counties League in 1980 and enjoyed success in the club's first year at senior status; winning the United Counties League Division One and the United Counties League Cup. Following three promotions in four seasons in the early 1990s, the club were promoted to the Conference National in 1994. Despite winning the league in the 1995–96 season, the club were denied promotion to the Football League due to insufficient ground facilities. Stevenage remained in the top tier of non-League for the following fourteen seasons, before the club earned promotion to the Football League after winning the Conference Premier in the 2009–10 season.
The promotion served as the catalyst for a rebranding of the club, dropping the word 'Borough' from its title in June 2010. In their first season in the Football League, Stevenage won promotion to League One, the third tier of English football, via the play-offs. The club achieved their highest league finish during the 2011–12 season courtesy of a sixth-placed finish in League One. The core of the team that helped guide the club to its success throughout 2009 to 2012 departed, and Stevenage were relegated back into League Two at the end of the 2013–14 season.
The club has also enjoyed success in national cup competitions, becoming the first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium in 2007, beating Kidderminster Harriers 3–2 to lift the FA Trophy in front of a competition record crowd of 53,262. They won the competition again in 2009. The club has also produced a number of notable results in the FA Cup against high-profile opposition.
