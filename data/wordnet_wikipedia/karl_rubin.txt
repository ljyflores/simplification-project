Karl Cooper Rubin (born January 27, 1956) is an American mathematician at  University of California, Irvine as Thorp Professor of Mathematics. Between 1997 and 2006, he was a professor at Stanford, and before that worked at Ohio State University between 1987 and 1999. His research interest is in elliptic curves. He was the first mathematician (1986) to show that some elliptic curves over the rationals have finite Tateâ€“Shafarevich groups. It is widely believed that these groups are always finite.
