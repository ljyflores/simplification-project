The Socialist Reich Party (German: Sozialistische Reichspartei Deutschlands) was a West German political party founded in the aftermath of World War II in 1949 as an openly neo-Nazi-oriented splinter from the national conservative German Right Party (DKP-DRP). The party achieved some electoral success in northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony and Bremen). In 1952, the SRP was the first political party to be banned by the Federal Constitutional Court.
