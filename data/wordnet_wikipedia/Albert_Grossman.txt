Sally Ann Grossman (née Buehler; August 22, 1939 – March 11, 2021) was an American model and the wife of Bob Dylan's one-time manager, Albert Grossman. According to some Dylan biographers, she introduced Dylan to his first wife Sara (although this claim is disputed by Dylan's stepson, Peter Lownds). She operated the Woodstock-based Bearsville Records following the death of her husband in 1986.
