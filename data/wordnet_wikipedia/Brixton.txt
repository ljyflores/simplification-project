It is owned by the Academy Music Group, and has become one of London's leading music venues, hosting over 50 live albums, and winning the NME Best Venue 12 times since 1994. It has been home to several notable performances, including The Smiths' last gig (December 1986), Leftfield's June 1996 concert which set a decibel record for a live gig at 137db, and Madonna's  gig in 2000, which was watched by an online audience of 9 million.In December 2022, two people died and others were seriously injured following a crowd crush at the door. As a result, the venue's licence is currently suspended.
