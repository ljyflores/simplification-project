The Tengwar () script is an artificial script, one of several scripts created by J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings.
Within the fictional context of Middle-earth, the Tengwar were invented by the Elf FÃ«anor, and used first to write the Elven tongues Quenya and Telerin. Later a great number of Tolkien's constructed languages were written using the Tengwar, including Sindarin. Tolkien used Tengwar to write English: most of Tolkien's Tengwar samples are actually in English.
