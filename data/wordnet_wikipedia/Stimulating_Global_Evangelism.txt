The Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, more commonly known as the Lausanne Movement, is a global movement that mobilizes Christian leaders to collaborate for world evangelization. The movement's fourfold vision is to see 'the gospel for every person, disciple-making churches for every people and place, Christ-like leaders for every church and sector, and kingdom impact in every sphere of society'.Born out of the 1974 International Congress on World Evangelization (ICOWE) in Lausanne, the Lausanne Movement began with the vision of Billy Graham to multiply mission efforts by bringing Christian leaders and influencers together for the task of evangelism.  John Stott was one of the founding members and the first to chair the Theology Working Group, who worked to produce the Lausanne Covenant, the movement's statement of theology and practice for world evangelization. The Lausanne Covenant is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential documents in modern church history. Later documents produced over the subsequent two congresses include The Manilla Manifesto (Lausanne II, 1989), which exists as an “elaboration” of the Covenant, and The Cape Town Commitment (Lausanne III, 2010), which is a confession of faith and a call to the global church for action.
Since 1974, the Lausanne Movement has become a platform for the convening of evangelical leaders, and has hosted a number of global congresses, gatherings, and catalytic networks that have impacted the scope of world missions and facilitated the expansion of Christianity in modern times. This has been achieved by connecting leaders across regions, issues, and generations to collaboratively and prayerfully work towards the advancement of the gospel.
