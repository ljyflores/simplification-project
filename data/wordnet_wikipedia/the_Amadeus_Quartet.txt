The Amadeus Quartet was a string quartet founded in 1947 and disbanded in 1987, having retained its founding members throughout its history.
Noted for its smooth, sophisticated style, its seamless ensemble playing, and its sensitive interpretation,
the quartet has often been seen as working within an Austrian tradition. However, it was formed and based in the United Kingdom.
