The Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line (Кали́нинско-Солнцевская ли́ния, IPA: [kəˈlʲinʲɪnskə ˈsontsəfskəjə ˈlʲinʲɪjə]) (Line 8) is a line of the Moscow Metro, currently consisting of two separate parts. It was opened as the eastwards Kalininskaya line in 1979, with the first stations of the western Solntsevsky radius opening in 2014. Presently there are 8 stations on the eastern section and 14 on the western section. The two parts are planned to be joined after 2023. To distinguish the 2 sections, the newer west section is identified as Line 8A.
