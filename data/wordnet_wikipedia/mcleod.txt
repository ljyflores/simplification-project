McLeod Ganj, also spelt McLeodganj, (pronounced Mc-loud-gunj) is a suburb of Dharamshala in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. It is known as "Little Lhasa" or "Dhasa" (a short form of Dharamshala used mainly by Tibetans) because of its large population of Tibetans. The Tibetan government-in-exile is headquartered in McLeod Ganj which treats the suburb as its Capital-in-exile.
