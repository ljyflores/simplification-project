Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is an action-adventure platform video game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in 1989, and in North America in 1990, and in Europe by Palcom in 1992. It was later released on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U.
Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse is the third installment in the Castlevania video game series. It is a prequel to the original Castlevania (much like the earlier Game Boy game Castlevania: The Adventure), set a few centuries before the events of the original game. The game's protagonist is Trevor C. Belmont, an ancestor of the original hero Simon Belmont.
