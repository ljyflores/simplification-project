Saint Antoine Street (officially in French: Rue Saint-Antoine), formerly known as Craig Street, is a street located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It runs to the south of Downtown Montreal and north of Old Montreal and Griffintown and Saint-Henri. It crosses the Quartier international de Montréal. Between Atwater Avenue and Greene Avenue, the north side of the street is in Westmount.
Saint-Antoine Street is primarily a one-way street with traffic running westbound only from Jean d'Estrées Street (exit from the eastbound Ville-Marie expressway) and eastbound only from Square Victoria. Between these two points, the traffic flows in both directions. The western terminus of Saint Antoine Street is at Saint Jacques Street in Saint-Henri. At the east the street leads onto Boulevard Ville-Marie (the street extension of the Ville-Marie expressway) and onto Notre-Dame Street near the Jacques Cartier Bridge.
