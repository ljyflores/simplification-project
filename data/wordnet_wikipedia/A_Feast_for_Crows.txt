A Feast for Crows is the fourth of seven planned novels in the epic fantasy  series A Song of Ice and Fire  by American author George R. R. Martin. The novel was first published on October 17, 2005, in the United Kingdom, with a United States edition following on November 8, 2005.Because of its size, Martin and his publishers split the narrative of the still-unfinished manuscript for A Feast for Crows into two books. Rather than divide the text chronologically in half, Martin instead split the material by plot location, resulting in "two novels taking place simultaneously" with different casts of characters. A Feast for  Crows was published months later, and focuses mainly on southern Westeros.  The concurrent novel A Dance with Dragons, which focuses on other locations such as the North, the Wall and Essos, was advertised for the following year, but was eventually released six years later in 2011. Martin noted that the A  Song of Ice and Fire series would now likely total seven novels.A Feast for  Crows was the first novel in the series to debut at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, a feat among fantasy writers only previously achieved by Robert Jordan and Neil Gaiman. In 2006 the novel was nominated for the Hugo Award, the Locus Award, and the British Fantasy Society Award. It has since been adapted, along with A Dance With Dragons, for television as the fifth season of Game of Thrones, though elements of the novel appeared in the series' fourth and sixth seasons.
