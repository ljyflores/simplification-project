The Blake River Megacaldera Complex is a giant subaqueous caldera cluster or a nested caldera system that spans across the Ontarioâ€“Quebec border in Canada.
The caldera complex is around 2.7 billion years old, consisting of a series of overlapping calderas of various ages and sizes. It lies within the southern zone of the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Superior Craton and has an area of 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi).
The Blake River Megacaldera Complex has been a centre of major interest since 2006 with numerous excursions at the international, national and local level. It is a world-class metallotect with respect to both hydrothermal Cu-Zn massive sulfides and gold-rich massive sulfides.
