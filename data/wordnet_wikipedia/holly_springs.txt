Holly Springs is a city in, and the county seat of, Marshall County, Mississippi, United States, near the border with Tennessee to the north.  Along with the Mississippi Delta, in the 19th century, the area was developed by European Americans for cotton plantations. After the Civil War, many freedmen continued to work in agriculture as sharecroppers and tenant farmers.
As the county seat, the city is a center of trade and court sessions. The population was 7,699 at the 2010 census, which, compared to the 2000 census, was a decrease. Holly Springs has several National Register of Historic Places-listed properties and historic districts, including Southwest Holly Springs Historic District, Holly Springs Courthouse Square Historic District, Depot-Compress Historic District, and East Holly Springs Historic District. Hillcrest Cemetery contains the graves of five Confederate generals, and has been called "Little Arlington of the South".
