Grameen Telecom (GTC) is a "Private Limited Company" by guarantee in Bangladesh established by Muhammad Yunus with a partial stake in Grameen Phone (GP). GTC has driven the pioneering GP program of Village Phone that enables rural poor to own a cell-phone and turn it into a profit making venture. The vision behind the village phone program was formulated by Iqbal Quadir who was convinced that a mobile phone could become a source of income generation. Quadir worked with Yunus and the Norwegian company Telenor to make the program a reality.
