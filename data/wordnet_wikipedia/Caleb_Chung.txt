Dumbo's Circus is a live action/puppet television series that aired on The Disney Channel beginning on May 6, 1985, and featured the character of Dumbo from the original film. Reruns continued to air until February 28, 1997.The cast members are human-sized anthropomorphic animals played by people in puppet suits using technology developed by Ken Forsse, the creator of Teddy Ruxpin. The same production technique was used for Welcome to Pooh Corner. Unlike Pooh Corner, the show never had NTSC VHS releases.
Many of the show's cast went on to star in the Christian radio series, Adventures in Odyssey. The wagon used in the show was seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s on the vehicle boneyard lot of the Studio Backlot Tour at Disney-MGM Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. When the series first started, Sebastian is seen wearing only his hat, vest and short pants. After a few episodes, he is given a white T-shirt to go with it. Some of the puppets that were used for audience members in the circus were used for Mother Goose's Treasury.
