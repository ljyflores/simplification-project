Live from Here, formerly known as A Prairie Home Companion with Chris Thile, is an American variety radio show known for its musical guests, tongue-in-cheek radio drama, and relaxed humor.  Hosted by Chris Thile, it aired live on Saturday evenings. The show's initial home was the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 2019, the show moved to The Town Hall in New York City, where it remained until its cancellation the next year.The show was derived from the historic A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor (APHC) radio show.  The original host, Garrison Keillor, performed his final show on July 2, 2016, and Thile's program began on October 15, 2016. Thile, an American virtuoso mandolinist and singer-songwriter, had a two-decade history with APHC and is known for his work in the folk and progressive bluegrass groups Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers. After Thile made two unprecedented guest host appearances in 2015, Keillor decided on his successor; featured Thile as host again in Januaryâ€“February 2016; and fully ceded his hosting role to Thile in the October 2016 performance at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, continuing as the show's Executive Producer. Thile's new program presented expanded musical and comedic elements, retaining the template of the earlier program (e.g., its then-present acting and sound effect cast, and "sponsorships" from fictitious companies), but without such features as its earlier signatures "Lives of the Cowboys" and "Guy Noir, Private Eye" series, and "News from Lake Wobegon" monologue.
