Carmen Basilio (born Carmine Basilio, April 2, 1927 â€“ November 7, 2012)  was an American professional boxer who was the world champion in both the welterweight and middleweight divisions, beating Sugar Ray Robinson for the latter title. An iron-chinned pressure fighter, Basilio was a combination puncher who had great stamina and eventually wore many of his opponents down with vicious attacks to the head and body.
In 1957, The Ring magazine named Basilio Fighter of the Year, while the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1955 and 1957. He also holds the distinction of being in The Ring magazine's Fight of the Year in five consecutive years (1955-59), a feat unmatched by any other boxer. In 2002, Basilio was voted by The Ring magazine as the 40th greatest fighter of the last 80 years. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990.
