The Zhengzhou Shang City (simplified Chinese: 郑州商城; traditional Chinese: 鄭州商城; pinyin: Zhèngzhōu Shāngchéng) is an archaeological site of the Bronze Age Erligang culture in Zhengzhou, Henan, China. Studies give it 4 chronological phases from 1630 to 1400 BC. The excavation of the site is of great importance in understanding the history of the dynasty. It is also one of the oldest archeological sites in China.
It was probably a capital of the Shang Dynasty, but of which of the several capitals was not certain.
