In Greek mythology, Eunomia (Ancient Greek: Εὐνομία) was a minor goddess of law and legislation (her name can be translated as "good order", "governance according to good laws"), as well as the spring-time goddess of green pastures (eû means "well, good" in Greek, and νόμος, nómos, means "law", while pasturelands are called nomia). She is by most accounts the daughter of Themis and Zeus. Her opposite number was Dysnomia (Lawlessness).
