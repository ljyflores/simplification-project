It is bordered by Greater Manchester to the north-west, West Yorkshire to the north, South Yorkshire to the north-east, Nottinghamshire to the east, Leicestershire to the south-east, Staffordshire to the west and south-west, and Cheshire to the west. The county’s largest settlement and only city, Derby, is now administered as a unitary authority. The rest of Derbyshire remains in the Derbyshire County Council local authority area.
