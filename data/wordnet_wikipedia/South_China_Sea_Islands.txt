The South China Sea Islands consist of over 250 islands, atolls, cays, shoals, reefs and seamounts in the South China Sea. The islands are mostly low and small, and have few inhabitants. The islands and surrounding seas are subject to overlapping territorial claims by the countries bordering the South China Sea.
The South China Sea Islands constitute a distinct tropical moist broadleaf forest terrestrial ecoregion, and the South China Sea Oceanic Islands marine ecoregion.
