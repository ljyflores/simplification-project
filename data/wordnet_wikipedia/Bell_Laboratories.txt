In the late 19th century, the laboratory began as the Western Electric Engineering Department, located at 463 West Street in New York City. In 1925, after years of conducting research and development under Western Electric, a Bell subsidiary, the Engineering Department was reformed into Bell Telephone Laboratories and placed under the shared ownership of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and Western Electric. In the 1960s, the laboratory was moved to New Jersey.  It was acquired by Nokia in 2016.
