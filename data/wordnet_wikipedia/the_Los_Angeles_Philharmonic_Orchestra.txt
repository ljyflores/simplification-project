The Los Angeles Philharmonic, commonly referred to as the LA Phil, is an American orchestra based in Los Angeles, California. It has a regular season of concerts from October through June at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, and a summer season at the Hollywood Bowl from July through September. Gustavo Dudamel is the current music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen is conductor laureate, Zubin Mehta is conductor emeritus, and Susanna MÃ¤lkki is principal guest conductor. John Adams is the orchestra's current composer-in-residence.
Music critics have described the orchestra as the most "contemporary minded", "forward thinking", "talked about and innovative", and "venturesome and admired" orchestra in America. According to Salonen:

"We are interested in the future. we are not trying to re-create the glories of the past, like so many other symphony orchestras."The orchestra's former chief executive officer, Deborah Borda, comparably stated:

"Especially since we moved into the new hall, our intention has been to integrate 21st-century music into the orchestra's everyday activity."Since the opening of the Walt Disney Concert Hall on October 23, 2003, the Los Angeles Philharmonic has presented 57 world premieres, one North American premiere, and 26 U.S. premieres, and has commissioned or co-commissioned 63 new works.
