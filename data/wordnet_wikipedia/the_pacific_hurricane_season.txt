The 2023 Pacific hurricane season is an upcoming event in the annual tropical cyclone season in the northern hemisphere. The season will officially begin on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; both will end on November 30. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific Ocean basin and are adopted by convention. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year.
