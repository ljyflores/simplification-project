The Vale of Glamorgan Council is the governing body for the Vale of Glamorgan, one of the Principal Areas of Wales. It was run by the Conservative Party after the 2008 United Kingdom local elections, taking over the council from no overall control.  Following the 2012 elections, it reverted to no overall control, and remained as such following the 2017 and 2022 elections.
