Tea utensils (茶道具, chadōgu) are the tools and utensils used in chadō, the art of Japanese tea.
Tea utensils can be divided into five major categories:

sōshoku dōgu (装飾道具, 'decorative items')
temae dōgu (点前道具, 'items for the tea-making service')
kaiseki dōgu (懐石道具, 'items for the chakaiseku meal')
mizuya dōgu (水屋道具, 'items used in the preparation room')
machiai dōgu/roji dōgu (待合道具/露地道具, 'items for the waiting room'/'items for the garden')A wide range of utensils, known collectively as dōgu, is necessary for even the most basic tea ceremony. Generally, items which guests prepare themselves with for attending a chanoyu gathering are not considered chadōgu; rather, the term fundamentally applies to items involved to "host" a chanoyu gathering. This article, however, includes all forms of implements and paraphernalia involved in the practice of chanoyu.
High-end utensils are cherished, well preserved and documented and serve as historical artifacts. The honorary title Senke Jusshoku is given to the ten artisans that provide the utensils for the events held by the three primary iemoto Schools of Japanese tea known as the san-senke.Utensils used for sencha are different, using a usually five-piece set of small cups, a small pot and a small cup to pour hot water. These utensils are typically ceramic.
