The American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAA&S) is one of the oldest learned societies in the United States. It was founded in 1780 during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, Andrew Oliver, and other Founding Fathers of the United States. It is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Membership in the academy is achieved through a thorough petition, review, and election process. The academy's quarterly journal, DÃ¦dalus, is published by the MIT Press on behalf of the academy. The academy also conducts multidisciplinary public policy research.
