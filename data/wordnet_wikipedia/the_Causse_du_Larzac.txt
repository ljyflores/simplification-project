Larzac (French pronunciation: ​[laʁzak], Occitan: [laɾˈzak]), also known as the Causse of Larzac (French: Causse du Larzac), is a limestone karst plateau in the south of the Massif Central, France, situated between Millau (in the département of l'Aveyron) and Lodève (in the département of l'Hérault). It is an agricultural area, where traditionally sheep produce milk for Roquefort cheese. Since the early 2010s, the agricultural production has largely diversified.
