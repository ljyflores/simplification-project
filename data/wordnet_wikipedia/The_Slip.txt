Slip It In is the fourth studio album by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag, released in 1984 on SST Records.
Slip It In is an extension of the sound Black Flag utilized on its second album My War: heavy, cathartic, intense, dense and progressive. The album pursued the newer, lengthier song arrangements that Black Flag would develop until its demise. It also features Henry Rollins' further development as a songwriter, contributing four of eight tracks on the album. This album also demonstrates Black Flag's increasing use of instrumentals, where Greg Ginn demonstrates his increasingly more complex playing style.
