Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) is an American professional wrestling promotion and former developmental promotion based in Louisville, Kentucky. The company is currently run by Al Snow, Matt Jones and Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg.
OVW was initially a member promotion of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from its inception in 1993 until 2000, when it became the primary developmental territory for the World Wrestling Federation, which is now known today as the WWE. It remained in this role from 2000 until February 7, 2008, when the promotion became unaffiliated. In November 2011, OVW became the developmental territory for Impact Wrestling (then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling or TNA). This relationship initially ended on November 2, 2013, but on March 19, 2019, the two promotions re-established their developmental agreement. In 2020, OVW stopped being a developmental promotion and transformed into a full-fledged TV promotion  featuring superstars such as Jessie Godderz, Mahabali Shera and current OVW National Heavyweight Champion James Storm.
OVW's television programming originates from the Davis Arena in the Buechel neighborhood of Louisville. Their weekly series, known informally as OVW TV, currently airs locally on WBNA-21 and is streaming online via FITE TV as well as the promotion's YouTube channel. As of 2020, through various syndication and distribution deals, OVW's weekly series is available to view in over 100 million households in the U.S, and to over 700 million worldwide.
