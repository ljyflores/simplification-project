Ewen is a male given name, most common throughout Scotland as well as Canada, due to the immigration of Scottish people. It is an anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic name, EÃ²ghann. It is possibly a derivative of the Pictish name, Uuen (or 'Wen'), "born of the mountain." Ewen or Ewan is also a Scottish surname, as in Clan MacEwen.
Ewen is also a Breton male given name, an alternative form of Erwan, the patron saint of Brittany. Owen is the predominant Welsh variation of the name. Ouen can be considered the French version of the name.
Euan is a Latin word meaning Bacchus.
