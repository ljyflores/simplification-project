Maria Olivera Lazarević (Serbian Cyrillic: Деспина Оливера Лазаревић; 1372 – after 1444), also known as Despina Hatun, was a Serbian princess and consort of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I. She was the youngest daughter of Lazar of Serbia and Princess Milica. She was the wife of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, whom she married just after the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 as a pledge of peace between the Lazarević and Ottoman dynasties.
The story of Olivera's and Bayezid's captivity by Timur after the Battle of Ankara (1402) has been popularly narrated, most often in plays and operas. The most significant one is Tamburlaine (1587–1588) by Christopher Marlowe, in which she is named “Zabina”.
