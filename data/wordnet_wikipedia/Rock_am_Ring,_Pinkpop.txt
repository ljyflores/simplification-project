From First to Last is an American post-hardcore band based in the Los Angeles Area and Tampa, Florida. Formed by Matt Good, Scott Oord, and Parker Nelms in November 1999, the current line-up consists of Matt Good (lead guitar, vocals), Sonny Moore (lead vocals), Travis Richter (rhythm guitar, unclean vocals), and Derek Bloom (drums).
The band released their first EP titled Aesthetic in 2003 which they recorded with founding member and vocalist Phillip Reardon who left the band in 2004 due to personal and creative differences. After signing with Epitaph Records, the band recruited Sonny Moore as their new vocalist. The band's first two albums, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Bodycount (2004) and Heroine (2006), were both underground successes, and sold a combined total of 304,000 copies in the United States without much radio airplay. The band also cultivated a large following on MySpace during this period, with the band's songs receiving over 20 million streams on the platform by March 2008.Following the departure of Moore in February 2007 to work on his solo electronic project, the band added permanent bassist Matt Manning, and Good moved to lead vocals/guitar. After signing with Suretone Records, the band issued their third, self-titled studio album in 2008; it received mixed reviews, and despite receiving a high-profile marketing campaign from the label, the album undersold expectations. The band moved to Rise Records in late 2009, and not long after, Richter left the band. Their fourth studio album, Throne to the Wolves was released on March 16, 2010. On July 28, 2010, the band entered a hiatus.
In November 2013, the band re-formed, with Periphery vocalist Spencer Sotelo as the new lead vocalist, as well as Richter rejoining the band. They released their fifth album Dead Trees in April 2015. Sotelo departed the band in July 2016. Former vocalist Sonny Moore rejoined the band in January 2017. In May 2020 Matt Good admitted that while there are a few tracks that could be on a new album, he's unsure if it will ever come to fruition.
