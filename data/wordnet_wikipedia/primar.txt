Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&R) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Boston, Massachusetts.  The organization was formed in 1974 by a group of researchers who sought to ensure that the concerns and experiences of those working in biomedical research would be reflected in the growing body of federal regulations governing the field.
Among PRIM&R's principal activities are education, membership services, certification programs, public policy initiatives, and professional development programs.  The key constituencies for PRIM&R's programming are human research protection professionals, animal care and use professionals, federal representatives,  institutional officials, researchers and research staff, representatives of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, those working with community and voluntary health organizations, and ethicists.
PRIM&R has a membership of more than 4,000 individuals worldwide.
