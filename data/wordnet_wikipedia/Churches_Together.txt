Christian Churches Together in the USA (CCT) is an organization formed in 2006 to "broaden and expand fellowship, unity and witness among the diverse expressions of Christian traditions in the USA."Christian Churches Together was created as a space for dialogue and cooperation among churches and ecumenical Christian organizations. It does not attempt to combine Christian faiths or compromise their distinctiveness. Rather, It provides a context in which churches can develop relationships with other churches with whom they presently have little or no contact. Christian Churches Together includes most, if not all, the Christian traditions in the USA {Catholic, Orthodox, Historic Protestant, Evangelical/Pentecostal, and Historic Black churches}. It also includes non-denominational Christian organizations. The major activity of the organization is the Annual Forum. In the past few years, topics addressed at the annual forum included gospel perspectives of life, immigration, mass incarceration, poverty and racism. CCT only speaks out on issues in which all the churches agree, coming to a decision by way of the consensus model.
