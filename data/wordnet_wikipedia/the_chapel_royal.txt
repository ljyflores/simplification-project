The Chapel Royal is an establishment in the Royal Household serving the spiritual needs of the sovereign and the British royal family. Historically it was a body of priests and singers that travelled with the monarch. The term is now also applied to the chapels within royal palaces, most notably at Hampton Court and St James's Palace, and other chapels within the Commonwealth designated as such by the monarch.  Within the Church of England, some of these royal chapels may also be referred to as Royal Peculiars, an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the monarch.  The Dean of His Majesty's Chapels Royal is a royal household office that in modern times is usually held by the Bishop of London.The Chapel Royal's most public role is to perform choral liturgical service. It has played a significant role in the musical life of the nation, with composers such as Tallis, Byrd, Bull, Gibbons and Purcell all having been members of the choir. The choir consists of Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal singing the lower parts alongside the boy choristers known as the Children of the Chapel.
