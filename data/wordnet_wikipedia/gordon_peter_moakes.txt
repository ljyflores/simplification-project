Gordon () is a masculine given name in the English language.  The name is derived from the Scottish surname Gordon.  It is uncertain if this surname originated from a place name in Scotland or in France.  The Gordon in Berwickshire, where the family who bore the surname held lands in the 12th century, is of uncertain etymology.  It is also possible that this place name was named after settlers from France, who were named after a like-named place in Normandy.  The surname is thought to have been taken up as a given name in honour of the Major-General Charles George Gordon, a British army officer who was killed in 1885, in Khartoum.
