Mickey Mouse Works (also known as Disney's Mickey Mouse Works or simply Mouse Works) is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends in a series of animated shorts. It is the first Disney television animated series to be produced in widescreen high definition.
Mickey Mouse Works is similar to a variety show, with skits starring Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, Pluto and Ludwig Von Drake while Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Chip 'n' Dale, Scrooge McDuck, Pete, Humphrey the Bear, J. Audubon Woodlore, Dinah the Dachshund, Butch the Bulldog, Mortimer Mouse, Jose Carioca, and Clara Cluck appear as supporting characters. Musical themes for each character were composed by Stephen James Taylor with a live 12-piece band and extensive use of the fretless guitar to which the music of the series was nominated for an Annie Award in both 1999 and 2001. The shorts from the series were later used in House of Mouse with the exception of two due to their offensive content.
The show returned to Disney Channel in Canada from December 1, 2015 to September 2, 2016 and came back from December 5 to 30, 2016. However, like 101 Dalmatians: The Series, only about half of the shorts aired, and most of the ones that did air were edited down (this was most likely due to scenes that were dubbed inappropriate for preschoolers). In Finland, the show was renamed Akun Tehdas ("Donald's Factory") due to how immensely popular cartoon icon Donald and his "Duckverse" comics was among Finns. Gags were entirely removed as well due to possible redundancy â€“ though sounds were left in still. In France, the show was called Mickey Mania.
