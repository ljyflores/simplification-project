Top Thrill Dragster is a hydraulically-launched steel roller coaster located at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. Manufactured by Intamin and designed by Werner Stengel, it opened in 2003 as the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, as well as the first full-circuit roller coaster to exceed 400 feet (120 m) in height. Top Thrill Dragster reaches a height of 420 feet (130 m), a maximum speed of 120 mph (190 km/h), and features a total track length of 2,800 feet (850 m). Its records were surpassed in 2005 by Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure.
Top Thrill Dragster is themed to Top Fuel drag racing, with the starting launch designed to resemble a dragstrip. The roller coaster is the second Accelerator Coaster model built by Intamin and one of two strata coasters in existence. It has also consistently ranked as one of the world's top steel coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards publication from Amusement Today. Following an incident in 2021 in which a guest was severely injured, the park closed the ride indefinitely, later announcing in September 2022 that Top Thrill Dragster would be retired and replaced with a new ride experience. As of January 9, 2023, the roller coaster is scheduled to reopen in 2024.
