The Reichstag (German: Reichstag, pronounced [ˈʁaɪçsˌtaːk] (listen); officially: Plenarbereich Reichstagsgebäude [ˈʁaɪçstaːksɡəˌbɔʏdə] (listen); English: Parliament) is a historic government building on Platz der Republik in Berlin that has been the seat of the German Bundestag since 1999. Since 1994, the Federal Convention has also met here to elect the Federal President.
The Neo-Renaissance building was built between 1884 and 1894 in the Tiergarten district on the left bank of the River Spree to plans by the architect Paul Wallot. It housed both the Reichstag of the German Empire and the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. Initially, the Reich's Federal Council also met there. After severe damage in the Reichstag fire of 1933 and during the Second World War, the building was modernised and restored in the 1960s and used for exhibitions and special events. From 1995 to 1999, the Reichstag was fundamentally redesigned by Norman Foster for its permanent use as a parliament building, which was decided in 1991. The keys were handed over to the President of the Bundestag, Wolfgang Thierse, on 19 April 1999. The Bundestag has been meeting there ever since. A landmark of the city is the walk-in glass dome above the plenary chamber, designed by Gottfried Böhm.
