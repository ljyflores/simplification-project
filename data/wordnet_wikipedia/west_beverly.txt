Beverly, officially Beverly Hills, is the 72nd of Chicago's 77 community areas. Located 12 miles (19 km) from the Loop, it is on the city's far south side. Beverly is considered part of the Blue Island Ridge, along with the nearby community areas of Morgan Park and Mount Greenwood, and Washington Heights, and the City of Blue Island. As of 2018, Beverly had 20,437 inhabitants.
Sparsely settled until the late 19th century, Beverly was incorporated as part of the Village of Washington Heights in 1874 and began development by business interests from Chicago. The area was annexed by the city of Chicago in 1890  and continued to grow with the completion in the Rock Island Railroad that runs parallel along the eastern edge of the Blue Island ridge to its terminus at LaSalle Street Station in downtown Chicago. Beverly's situation along on the ridge allowed the community to become an exclusive streetcar community, which is reflected in the homes and large lots.
