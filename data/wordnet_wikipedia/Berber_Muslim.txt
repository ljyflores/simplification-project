Berbers (Arabic: بربر), also called Amazigh () or Imazighen (Berber languages: ⵉⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵏ, ⵎⵣⵗⵏ, romanized: Imaziɣen; singular: Amaziɣ, ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ ⵎⵣⵗ; Arabic: أمازيغ), are an ethnic group indigenous to the Maghreb region of North Africa, where they live all across Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Mauritania, northern Mali and northern Niger. Smaller Berber communities are also found in Burkina Faso and  Egypt's Siwa and Qara oases. Historically, Berber nations have spoken Berber languages, which are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family related to ancient  Egyptian.Descended from Stone Age tribes of North Africa, accounts of the Imazighen were first mentioned in  Ancient Egyptian writings. From about 2000 BCE, Amazigh languages spread westward from the Nile Valley across the northern Sahara into the Maghreb. A series of Berber peoples such as the Mauri, Masaesyli, Massyli, Musulamii, Gaetuli, and Garamantes  gave rise to Berber kingdoms, such as Numidia and Mauretania. Other kingdoms appeared in late antiquity, such as  Altava, Aurès,  Ouarsenis, and Hodna. Berber kingdoms were eventually suppressed by the  Arab conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries CE. Islam later provided the ideological stimulus for the rise of fresh Berber dynasties and empires, such as the Almoravids and Almohads. Their Berber successors - the Marinids, the Zayyanids, and the Hafsids - continued to rule until the 16th century. From the 16th century onward the process continued in the absence of Berber dynasties; in Morocco, they were replaced by Arabs claiming descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad.The Amazigh are known for their diverse and rich culture among their tribes throughout the Maghreb, sharing cultural elements and influences from Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. In Morocco, Berber culture has provided the invaluable tourist industry with much of its cachet: its distinctive architecture, crafts, and costumes.
