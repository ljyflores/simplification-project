N-Dubz are an English hip hop trio from Camden Town, London, consisting of cousins Dappy and Tulisa, and Fazer. After winning a MOBO Award for Best Newcomer in 2007, N-Dubz briefly signed to Polydor Records before joining All Around the World. Released the following year, the trio's debut album Uncle B was certified double platinum and spawned four UK top-40 singles.
In 2009, N-Dubz won Best UK Act at the MOBO Awards and released their second album, Against All Odds. It charted at number six and was certified platinum, preceded by their first top-10 single "I Need You". The same year, N-Dubz achieved their first UK chart-topper, as a featured artist on Tinchy Stryder's song "Number 1". The trio's third album, Love.Live.Life (2010), charted at number seven and became their third successive platinum-selling album. It included the top-10 singles "We Dance On" and "Best Behaviour". The group then took an 11-year hiatus to pursue solo careers before announcing their reformation in May 2022, releasing single ‘Charmer’ and a sold-out UK arena tour in November and December.
