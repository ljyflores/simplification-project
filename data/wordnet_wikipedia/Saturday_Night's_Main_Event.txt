Saturday Night's Main Event is an American professional wrestling television program that is produced by WWE (known at the time of launch as the World Wrestling Federation). Premiering in 1985, it originally aired on NBC in the United States as 29 occasional replacements for Saturday Night Live until 1991, then twice on Fox in 1992. It was revived in 2006 for five NBC episodes before ending in 2008. In Canada, it also aired on Citytv and Global Television Network in order to meet simultaneous substitution rights.
At the time of the original airing, it was a rare example of professional wrestling being broadcast on an over-the-air commercial television network after the 1950s. It coincided with and contributed to the apogee of the "second golden age" of professional wrestling in the United States. In a time when weekly programming consisted primarily of established stars dominating enhancement talent, Saturday Night's Main Event was made up almost entirely of star vs. star bouts, including title matches and specialty matches such as steel cage matches, handicap matches, etc.
With the exception of “Big Four” pay-per-view events, ‘’Saturday Night’s Main Event’’ served as monthly event and was equivalent to today’s monthly pay-per-view events.
Because it aired late, ‘’Saturday Night’s Main Event’’ always held its main event match in the first hour of the show.
All episodes of Saturday Night's Main Event are available for streaming on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network elsewhere, with some episodes slightly altered from their original broadcasts. On these platforms, the May 1985 to January 1988 episodes do not have the original opening and closing theme songs. Additionally, sponsored segments that aired as part of the original broadcasts, such as the "Mountain Dew Slam of the Night", have been removed.
In April 2022, WWE revived the Saturday Night's Main Event title for house shows held on Saturday nights.
