Pan dulce, literally meaning "sweet bread", is the general name for a variety of Mexican pastries. Wheat-based breads were first introduced in Mexico by Spanish colonists, settlers and immigrants; however, Mexican pan dulce as we know it today rose to popularity during the French occupation in the mid 1800s. They are inexpensive treats and are consumed as breakfast and or dinner.
