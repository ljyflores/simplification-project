The Pool Malebo, formerly Stanley Pool, also known as Mpumbu, Lake Nkunda or Lake Nkuna by local indigenous people in pre-colonial times, is a lake-like widening in the lower reaches of the Congo River.  The river serves as the border between the Republic of the Congo on the north and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south.
The pool's former name was in honour of the British explorer and journalist Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who mapped this area.
