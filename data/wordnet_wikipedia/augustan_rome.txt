The article highlights the forms of propaganda Roman Emperor Augustus employed as he ascended to power.
Augustus employed several forms of artwork and literature to boast the image of the enforcer of the Pax Romana (Roman Peace), alternatively called Pax Augusta. He can be perceived as a historically important figure who effectively utilised propaganda in creating and maintaining his principate. Augustus’ wide range of propaganda targeted all aspects of Roman society, art and architecture to appeal to the population, coinage to represent himself to the masses, and finally literature such as poetry and history for the wealthy upperclass in order to exert power and to maintain peace and prosperity.The propaganda didn’t only exist as a form of media, but Augustus’ family, the women especially played a pivotal role in helping to maintain the Principate. His family was essential in acting as examples of the ideal Roman citizen, this aspect is clearly enunciated through the responsibility of his wife. Moreover, one of his daughters, Julia the Elder was indispensable in solidifying Augustus' bloodline in future ruling generation, ensuring the continuation of Augustus' successful legacy.Thus, Augustus’ multi-faceted approach allowed for him to dominate public and private sectors of daily Roman life. Archaeological evidence and scholarly interpretations demonstrate the effectiveness of Augustus’ propaganda.
The images that Augustus desired to project aimed to idolise him in all Roman aspects, from a military with successful triumphs, to a reliable religious leader through reinforcing his divine Julian ancestry. However, most importantly Augustus aimed to stabilise Rome from civil strife as the city had been plagued by fight for power.
