Derek Michael Chauvin ( SHOH-vən; born March 19, 1976) is an American former police officer, who was convicted of murdering George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Chauvin was a member of the Minneapolis Police Department from 2001 to 2020.
Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for about nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street, calling out "I can't breathe", during an arrest made with three other officers on May 25, 2020. Chauvin was dismissed by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) on May 26 and arrested on May 29. The murder set off a series of protests in the Twin Cities and across the rest of the United States, later spreading around the world.
In his career, Chauvin had 18 complaints against him on official record and was involved in three police shootings, one of which was fatal. On October 29, 2006, he was involved in the killing of an Ojibwe, Wayne Reyes, by 23 gunshots. In the early morning of May 24, 2008, Chauvin almost killed unarmed Ira Latrell Toles by beating and twice shooting him. On August 8, 2011, Chauvin was put on a three-day leave for his involvement in the shooting of Leroy Martinez, who was not armed. In 2017, Chauvin hit a 14-year-old black boy in the head with a flashlight, then held him down with his knee for almost 17 minutes, ignoring the boy's complaints that he could not breathe.On March 8, 2021, Chauvin was put on trial for unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter of Floyd before a jury in the Minnesota Fourth Judicial District Court.  On April 20, he was convicted of the charges.  On June 25, he was sentenced to 22+1⁄2 years in prison (minus the 199 days' time served), with the possibility of supervised release contingent on factors such as good behavior after two-thirds of his sentence (the sentence before any deductions of time), or 15 years for this second-degree murder conviction.In December 2021, Chauvin pled guilty to federal charges of violating Floyd's civil rights by using unreasonable force and ignoring Floyd's serious medical needs. Simultaneously, Chauvin pled guilty to violating a 14-year-old boy's civil rights in 2017 by using unreasonable force. On July 7, 2022, Chauvin was sentenced to 21 years in prison for violating Floyd's civil rights. The federal and state sentences are to run concurrently. The Minnesota Department of Corrections lists Chauvin's anticipated release date on the state sentence as December 10, 2035. For the Federal charges, Chauvin will likely be released from prison in the year 2038.  He is currently incarcerated at FCI Tucson in Arizona, a medium-security federal facility.
