Allspark, formerly known as Hasbro Studios, LLC, was an American production and distribution company located in Burbank, California. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of the American toy and multimedia company Hasbro. Originally just a TV production division, many of its TV shows were based on Hasbro properties and were broadcast on multiple media platforms, including Discovery Family.Allspark Pictures was Allspark's live-action production label, while Allspark Animation was its animation production label. Cake Mix Studio was the company's Rhode Island-based producer of commercials and short form content.Following Hasbro's acquisition of Entertainment One on December 30, 2019, the production & distribution of film and television content based on Hasbro properties is now being managed by the acquired company under the leadership of Darren Throop, president of family brands Olivier Dumont, and former HBO head of programming Michael Lombardo. As a result, Allspark was absorbed into Entertainment One. However, in late-2022, Hasbro announced their intent to sell eOne with companies such as  Fremantle (who dropped out of the bid), Lionsgate,  Legendary, CVC Capital Partners and GoDigital Media Group bidding for the acquisition, a transaction that would place the distribution rights to the Allspark library and newer content back to Hasbro.
