Wilma with Cat (Dutch: Wilma met kat) is a portrait of Wilma Willink, painted by her husband Carel Willink in 1940. Wilma is depicted in half-length portrait with a cat in her arms and a colonnade in the background. The cat, whose name was Negus, was euthanised shortly after the painting was made.
Associated with magic realism, Wilma with Cat has been praised for its technical accomplishment. Museum Arnhem purchased it in 1960. Since 2021, there is a large reproduction of the painting on a house fa√ßade in Arnhem.
