Frédéric Chopin's disease and the reason for his premature death at age 39 were frequently debated for over 150 years.  Although he was diagnosed with and treated for tuberculosis throughout his lifetime, a number of alternative diagnoses have been suggested since his death in 1849. A comprehensive review of the possible causes of Chopin's illness was published in 2011. A visual examination of Chopin's heart, for which permission was finally given in 2017, indicated the likely cause of death as pericarditis, caused by tuberculosis. This has been disputed by pathologists who say that a visual examination alone cannot confirm such a disease.
