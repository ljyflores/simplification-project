Starr Gate is a suburb in the South Shore district of Blackpool in the county of Lancashire, England. It is located at the southwest end of Blackpool on the Fylde coast, adjacent to the Squires Gate district of Blackpool.
The place is named after the spiky "Starr" grass which grows on the local sand hills to the south of Starr Gate. "Gate" (Geat in Old English) means "Way", taken from the Old Norse Gat - an opening or passage.
