Pro tempore (), abbreviated pro tem or p.t., is a Latin phrase which best translates to "for the time being" in English.  This phrase is often used to describe a person who acts as a locum tenens (placeholder) in the absence of a superior, such as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate, who acts in place of the president of the United States Senateâ€”a position that is held ex officio by the current vice president of the United States. Legislative bodies can have one or more pro tempore for the presiding officer.  These positions ostensibly go to legislators experienced in floor debate who are familiar with the content and application of relevant rules and precedents and who have a reputation for fairness among their colleagues. The phrase is also used to describe officers appointed on a temporary basis, prior to the formalisation of their appointments.
