Mfantsipim is an all-boys boarding secondary school  in Cape Coast, Ghana, established by the Methodist Church in 1876 to foster intellectual, moral, and spiritual growth on the then Gold Coast. Its founding name was Wesleyan High School and the first headmaster was James Picot, a French scholar, who was only 18 years old on his appointment.
After changing its name to Wesleyan Collegiate School and Richmond College, the school, in 1905, merged with another Cape-Coast-based public high school established by John Mensah Sarbah (an old student of Wesley High School), who had established his own school called "Mfantsipim" as a rival of the Methodist-run school.
John Mensah Sarbah died five years after the merger, at the age of 46, leaving the school wholly in the hands of the Methodist Church.
Mfantsipim is nicknamed "The School" because it gave birth to other prominent schools such as Prempeh College. Other schools, such as Ghana National College, were started with students from Mfantsipim. Schools established under the Mfantsipim blueprint include Achimota School, Mawuli School and Ghana Secondary Technical School. Mfantsipim trainers also started Wesley Girls High School, the nation's most prominent all-female second cycle institution.
Mfantsipim, since Ghana's independence in 1957, has produced 3 Bank of Ghana Governors, 3 Vice Presidents, and 1 Head of State.
