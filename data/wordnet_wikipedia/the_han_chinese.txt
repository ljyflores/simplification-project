The subgroups of the Han Chinese people are defined based on linguistic, cultural, ethnic, genetic and regional features. The terminology used in Mandarin to describe the groups is: "minxi" (Chinese: 民系; pinyin: mínxì; Wade–Giles: min2 hsi4; lit. 'ethnic lineages', pronounced [mǐnɕî]), used in Mainland China or "zuqun" (Chinese: 族群; pinyin: zúqún; Wade–Giles: tzu2 ch'ün; lit. 'ethnic groups', pronounced [tsǔtɕʰy̌n]), used in Taiwan. No Han subgroup is recognized as one of People's Republic of China's 56 official ethnic groups.
