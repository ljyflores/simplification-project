WrestleMania XXX was the 30th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on April 6, 2014, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana and was the first WWE event simultaneously broadcast live on PPV and WWE's subscription streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan served as the host of the event.
Seven matches were contested on the event's card, including one on the Pre-Show. In the main event, Daniel Bryan defeated Batista and defending champion Randy Orton in a triple threat match to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship after Bryan qualified for the match by defeating Triple H in the opening bout. In other prominent matches, John Cena defeated Bray Wyatt and Brock Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to end his undefeated streak at WrestleMania. The event also saw the WWE Divas Championship defended on the main card, the first and only time it was contested for at WrestleMania.
WWE claimed $10.9 million in ticket revenue for WrestleMania XXX and estimated a $142.2 million economic impact on New Orleans. The event has received highly positive reviews, and is often regarded as one of the greatest WrestleMania events of all time. SLAM! Wrestling rated the show a 4.5 out of 5, while Pro Wrestling Torch rated the event 8.75 out of 10 and The Times-Picayune described it as "spectacular". Particular praise has been given to the overall Daniel Bryan vs. The Authority storyline, which culminated at the event. Despite the event's positive reception, the decision to have Brock Lesnar end The Undertaker's undefeated streak polarized fans, critics, and former wrestlers.
