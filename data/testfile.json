                "We found two small studies that presented data for 49 participants with arterial leg ulcers (search conducted January 2019). The studies also included participants with other kinds of ulcers, and it is not clear what proportion of participants were diabetic. Neither study described the methods fully, both presented limited results for the arterial ulcer participants, and one study did not provide information on the number of participants with an arterial ulcer in the control group. The follow-up periods (six and eight weeks) were too short to measure healing. Therefore, the data that were available were incomplete and cannot be generalised to the greater population of people who suffer from arterial leg ulcers. One study randomised participants to either 2% ketanserin ointment in polyethylene glycol (PEG) or PEG alone, administered twice a day over eight weeks. This study reported increased wound healing in the ketanserin group, when compared with the control group. It should be noted that ketanserin is not licensed for use in humans in all countries. The second study randomised participants to either topically-applied growth factors isolated from the participant's own blood (concentrated growth factors (CGF)), or standard dressing; both applied weekly for six weeks. This study reported that 66.6% of CGF-treated diabetic arterial ulcers showed more than a 50% decrease in ulcer size, compared to 6.7% of non-healing ulcers treated with standard dressing. Only one study mentioned side effects, and reported that no participant experienced side effects during follow-up (six weeks). Neither of the two studies reported time to ulcer healing, patient satisfaction or quality of life measures. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the choice of topical agent or dressing affects the healing of arterial leg ulcers. We downgraded the overall certainty of the available evidence to 'very low' and 'low', because the studies reported their methods poorly, there were only two studies and few participants with arterial disease, and because the studies were short and reported few results. This made it impossible to determine whether there was any real difference in the number of ulcers healed between the groups."

Trials examining the effects of (caused by some previous phenomenon.) written information (Sender sends payload to addressee as information.) need to be better designed (Individual's name or personal mark, used to sign documents and employed to signify that the writing which precedes accords with one's wishes and intentions; having a handwritten signature.) and use consistent and validated outcome measures (Description:Operational activities conducted for the purposes of assessing the results (The result of a laboratory, radiologic, or other clinical test performed to determine the presence, absence, or degree of a condition.) of an activity, product, or service).

                "The findings of this review were inconclusive for a number of reasons. First, because the included trials measured different outcomes in different ways, we were unable to combine their results. Second, these trials presented the written information for patients in different ways, and most did not design the leaflets in a way that made them easy to read. Third, in many cases trials were not clearly reported, so we do not know if they were carried out correctly. Despite these limitations several trials, while using different types of information and different measures, found written information improved knowledge. This is encouraging for people who want to learn about their medicines from leaflets. None of the studies showed that written information was harmful. Future research needs to use improved methods, and needs to examine the same measures on many occasions. It is important that medicines information be well written and designed to maximise the possibility of improving knowledge. Consumers are increasingly seeking out health information, including information about medicines, on the internet, but we found no trials examining whether internet-based medicines information changed people's knowledge, attitudes, or behaviour."

We looked for randomised clinical trials (where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments groups) and used information from those we found to form our conclusions. We found evidence up to 21 March 2017. The review authors found two small randomised clinical trials, in which a total of 104 people with pleural mesothelioma were randomised. One trial compared the addition of surgery and radiotherapy to chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. The other trial compared the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy and surgery with chemotherapy and surgery alone. These two small trials suggested that there is no added value for either radiotherapy or combined radiotherapy and surgery. We could not combine the data from the trials as we had intended, because the two trials were too different. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate for survival and low quality for all the other outcomes studied. The review authors identified three ongoing randomised clinical trials, the results of which have not been published yet. We only found two relevant trials. Both were small, which made the results uncertain. It is not clear whether giving a combination of surgery and radical radiotherapy after chemotherapy is better than giving chemotherapy alone. Radical radiotherapy does not seem to improve the results of surgery alone."

                "This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10-minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow-up were high and 285 completed the post-test questionnaire in the third trimester. Only 5% of the intervention women recalled having obtained information on toxoplasmosis prevention during prenatal classes. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The other trial conducted in France involved 5023 pregnant women with no evidence of toxoplasmosis infection (seronegative) who were randomly assigned to receive a brochure and an audiotape containing information for toxoplasmosis prevention, or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow-up were high and 2790 completed both pre-test and post-test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow-up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow-up). Women's behavior did not change after the intervention. Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. This limits our confidence in the results. Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited."

                "Evidence in this review is current to July 2019. We included two randomised controlled trials (where participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either treatment) including 1674 adult participants who had one or more risk factors for developing CVD, which compared NP-guided treatment with standard care. We excluded patients with symptoms of heart failure. The mean age of participants varied between 64.1 and 67.8 years. Patients were followed-up for between 2 years and a mean of 4.2 years. Effects of NP-guided treatment on death due to CVD or for any other reason remain uncertain as our results were imprecise. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that NP-guided treatment probably reduces the number of hospitalisations due to cardiovascular events and due to all causes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. We would expect that of 1000 patients who received standard care, 163 would be admitted to hospital as the result of a cardiovascular event, compared to between 65 and 111 patients who received NP-guided treatment. Out of 1000 patients with cardiovascular risk factors who received standard care, 601 would be admitted to hospital for any reason, compared to between 457 and 553 patients who received NP-guided treatment. High-quality evidence indicates that NP-guided treatment reduces the risk of ventricular dysfunction (a condition that often leads to heart failure) compared to standard care. Our results suggest that of 1000 patients with cardiovascular risk factors who received standard care, 87 would develop ventricular dysfunction, compared to between 36 and 79 patients who received NP-guided treatment. No evidence suggests that NP-guided treatment affected NP level at completion of the studies. The quality of evidence ranged from low to high across outcomes. Key reasons for concern about the quality of the evidence included risk of bias, as patients and medical staff caring for patients knew whether they were in the control or intervention group and this may have affected the care they received; some results obtained were imprecise, and it is unclear if the intervention was beneficial or harmful. As we identified only two studies that were suitable for inclusion in this review, the generalisability of the review is limited."

The second trial compared two methods of manual reduction. These were a novel method of manual reduction where participants actively provided counter-traction without being given anaesthesia versus traditional manual reduction under intravenous regional anaesthesia. The participants of the novel method group suffered more but not intolerable pain during the reduction procedure, which was shorter in duration. No differences in anatomical outcome were detected. The third trial compared mechanical reduction involving a special device without anaesthesia versus manual reduction under haematoma block (local anaesthesia). Less pain during the reduction procedure was recorded for the mechanical traction group. Both methods yielded similar anatomical results. Fewer participants of the mechanical traction group had signs of neurological impairment, mainly finger numbness, at five weeks but this difference was not statistically significant by one year.

                "We found six studies, all from the USA, four of which targeted African Americans and two which targeted Latino or Chinese immigrants. Of the studies, four were experimental (1693 volunteers) and two reported the results of large, targeted campaigns run in whole communities and cities. The evidence is current to August 2016. The available evidence is insufficient to conclude whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more, less or equally effective in changing health behaviours than general mass media interventions. Only one study compared participants' smoking habits and intentions to quit following the receipt of either a culturally adapted smoking advice booklet or a booklet developed for the general population. They found little or no differences in smoking behaviours between the groups. When compared to no mass media intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit lines, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. This conclusion is based on findings from three studies. One study gave participants access to a series of 12 live shows on cable TV with information on how to maintain a healthy weight through diet and physical activity. Compared to women who did not watch the shows, participants reported slightly increased physical activity and some positive changes to their dietary patterns; however, their body weight was no different over time. Two other studies were large-scale targeted campaigns in which smokers were encouraged to call a quit line for smoking cessation advice. The number of telephone calls from the target population increased considerably during the campaign. This review also compared targeted mass media interventions versus mass media interventions with added personal interactions. These findings, based on three studies, were inconclusive. None of the studies reported whether the interventions could have had any adverse effects, such as possible stigmatisation or increased resistance to messages. Further studies directly comparing targeted mass media interventions with general mass media interventions would be useful. Few studies have investigated the effects of targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups who primarily speak a non-dominant language. Our confidence in the evidence of effect on all main outcomes is low to very low. This means that the true effect may be different or substantially different from the results presented in this review. We have moderate confidence in the estimated increase in the number of calls to smoking quit lines."

(An article or book published after examination of published material on a subject.) indicates that music (Sound that expresses emotion through rhythm, melody, and harmony.) listening (The process whereby auditory stimuli are selected, organized, and interpreted by the organism.) may have a beneficial effect (caused by some previous phenomenon.) on anxiety (Feelings or emotions of dread, apprehension, and impending disaster but not disabling as with ANXIETY DISORDERS.) in mechanically ventilated (A method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients by use of a powered device that forces oxygenated air into the lungs.) patients (Individuals participating in the health care system for the purpose of receiving therapeutic, diagnostic, or preventive procedures.).

(An article or book published after examination of published material on a subject.)s on the use of music (Sound that expresses emotion through rhythm, melody, and harmony.) intervention (In medicine, a treatment (Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s for anxiety (Feelings or emotions of dread, apprehension, and impending disaster but not disabling as with ANXIETY DISORDERS.) reduction (A chemical reaction that results (The result of a laboratory, radiologic, or other clinical test performed to determine the presence, absence, or degree of a condition.) in a gain of electrons by one of the chemical species involved in the reaction.) in medical patients (Individuals participating in the health care system for the purpose of receiving therapeutic, diagnostic, or preventive procedures.). The review (An article or book published after examination of published material on a subject.) furthermore suggests that music (Sound that expresses emotion through rhythm, melody, and harmony.) listening (The process whereby auditory stimuli are selected, organized, and interpreted by the organism.) consistently reduces (Made less in size or amount or degree.) respiratory rate (The rate of breathing (inhalation and exhalation) measured within in a unit time, usually expressed as breaths per minute.) and systolic blood pressure (The maximum pressure exerted into the systemic arterial circulation during the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart.). Finally, results (The result of a laboratory, radiologic, or other clinical test performed to determine the presence, absence, or degree of a condition.) indicate a possible beneficial impact on the consumption (The using or using up of goods and services, especially the rate at which they are used.) of sedative (Drugs used to induce drowsiness or sleep or to reduce psychological excitement or anxiety.)s and analgesics (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.). Therefore, we conclude that music (Sound that expresses emotion through rhythm, melody, and harmony.) intervention (In medicine, a treatment (Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s may provide a viable anxiety (Feelings or emotions of dread, apprehension, and impending disaster but not disabling as with ANXIETY DISORDERS.) management (Performing or possessing executive duties; acting as a supervisor or manager.) option to mechanically ventilated (A method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients by use of a powered device that forces oxygenated air into the lungs.) patients (Individuals participating in the health care system for the purpose of receiving therapeutic, diagnostic, or preventive procedures.).",

                "We included 14 controlled trials involving 805 critically ill participants on mechanical ventilation. All participants were alert. Slightly more patients (58%) included in these studies were male and their average age was 58 years. The majority of the studies examined the effects of patients listening to pre-recorded music. Most studies offered one 20 to 30-minute music session to the participants. The findings suggest that music listening may have a large anxiety-reducing effect on mechanically ventilated patients. The results furthermore suggest that music listening consistently reduces respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure, suggesting a relaxation response. No evidence of effect was found for diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, or oxygen saturation level and inconsistent results were found for heart rate and hormone levels. One large-scale study reported greater reductions in the intake of sedative and analgesic medications in the music listening group compared to the control group, and two other studies reported similar trends. Music listening did not result in any harm. Most trials presented some methodological weakness. Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with caution. However, the results are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions for anxiety reduction in medical patients. Therefore, we conclude that music interventions may provide a viable anxiety management option to mechanically ventilated patients."

                "In July 2018 we searched for randomised clinical trials where ketamine was injected before, during, or after operation in adults having an operation under general anaesthesia. Important outcomes were opioid use and pain at 24 and 48 hours after the operation, time to first request for a painkiller, and ketamine-related side effects. We found 130 eligible studies with 8341 participants. Compared to people given control treatment, those given intravenous ketamine used less opioid painkiller (by about 1 part in 10), and had less pain (by about 2 parts in 10; moderate- or high-quality evidence). Ketamine may be more effective in operations that are likely to cause more intense pain. People given ketamine requested painkillers 54 minutes later than those who did not receive ketamine (moderate-quality evidence). Ketamine reduced the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small amount (high-quality evidence). Ketamine produced no increased risk of central nervous system side effects (hallucination, nightmares or double vision) (high-quality evidence). Future research should assess ketamine's effect after operations that are accompanied by intense pain such as thoracotomy, back surgery, or amputations. Additionally, assessing ketamine's effects among particular patient groups, for example, the elderly or individuals with a history of substance abuse would be of interest. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We found the quality of evidence for most outcomes to be moderate. Many of the studies were small, which was the main reason for downgrading the evidence from high to moderate. We tested the results by operation type, timing of ketamine injection, and by looking at larger studies, and those with more pain were consistent, and provided confidence in the results. There was sufficient evidence to allow conclusions about ketamine's effect on pain, painkiller consumption and side effects after operation."

The majority of participants had suffered a broken tibia that had not healed as quickly as expected or at all. The results of this review suggest that there may be a benefit on bone healing from electromagnetic field stimulation. However, the available evidence was not good enough to be certain of this and it may not apply to current practice. Electromagnetic field stimulation appears to be safe.

                "Five studies involving 1382 patients were included in this review. All the included studies involved advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer. No study was of adequate size and duration. Few events were reported and they did not assess disease-specific survival or metastatic disease. Only one study evaluated biochemical outcomes. Studies primarily reported on adverse events. There are no data for the relative effectiveness of IAS versus CAS for overall survival, prostate cancer specific survival, disease progression, or quality of life. Limited information suggests IAS may have slightly reduced adverse events. In Hering 2000, IAS (18/25 versus 18/18) appears to be slightly more favorable than CAS in controlling impotence. Overall, IAS was also as effective as CAS for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%). More research is needed."

                "We did computer searches for randomised trials of IUDs inserted right after abortion or miscarriage. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies. Trials could compare types of IUDs or times for insertion. We found 12 studies to include. Four trials randomised women to an IUD inserted right away or at a later time. One had no major difference. Three recent trials (of levonorgestrel intrauterine system or CuT380A) showed use was greater at six months for an IUD inserted right away compared to one inserted later. Another trial assigned women to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T; more women with the Nova T stopped use due to pregnancy. A subanalysis showed more IUDs came out when inserted right after abortion or miscarriage rather than later. Seven trials looked at inserting the IUD right away. From two large trials, the TCu 220C was better than the Lippes Loop and the Copper 7 for preventing pregnancy and staying in. The IUD was more likely to come out on its own when inserted after a mid-pregnancy abortion than after an earlier one. In other work, when the Lippes Loop had copper arms added, fewer women got pregnant and the IUD stayed in more often. Moderate level evidence shows that inserting an IUD right after an abortion or miscarriage is safe and practical. However, the IUD is more likely to come out when inserted right away rather than at a later time. Women are more likely to use an IUD at six months if they had it inserted right away compared to some weeks after the abortion or miscarriage."
