Asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency department presentation and hospital admission. There remains uncertainty as to the long-term effect of education on other markers of asthma (Bleeding originating from the upper gastrointestinal tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach).) morbidity such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function. It remains unclear as to what type, duration and intensity of educational packages are the most effective in reducing acute care utilisation.",

Ketamine (Excision of the uterus.) was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. Types of surgery included ear (Paroxysmal, recurrent episodes of vomiting.), nose (A benefit, consideration, or positive motivational influence, financial or otherwise, given to induce a specific action.) or throat surgery (Increased pressure within the pulmonary arterial circulation.), wisdom tooth extraction (put in the body as a prosthesis, or for treat (Treatment of disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.)ment or diagnosis.), thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy (used in the treat (Treatment of disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.)ment of ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION and PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.), hip joint replacement surgery (higher.), knee joint replacement surgery, anterior cruciate ligament repair (One of the type I interferons produced by peripheral blood leukocytes or lymphoblastoid cells.), knee arthroscopy, mastectomy (Excision of one or more of the parathyroid glands.), haemorrhoidectomy (Highly specialized EPITHELIAL CELLS that line the HEART; BLOOD VESSELS; and lymph vessels, forming the ENDOTHELIUM.), abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy (Drugs that bind to but do not activate DOPAMINE RECEPTORS, thereby blocking the actions of dopamine or exogenous agonists.), thyroid surgery, elective caesarean section (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.), and laparoscopic surgery. Racemic ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions (The terminus of the aortic root; the point at which the aorta attains a tubular configuration.) 2 to 5 \u00b5g/kg/minute; 10 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter) used only S-ketamine (Thickening and loss of elasticity of the CORONARY ARTERIES, leading to progressive arterial insufficiency (CORONARY DISEASE).) and one only R-ketamine. Risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size; most had fewer than 50 participants per treat (Treatment of disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.)ment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery (A phenothiazine antipsychotic used principally in the treat (Treatment of disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.)ment of NAUSEA; VOMITING; and VERTIGO.) or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis. Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine (A group of islands in the southwest Pacific.) equivalents (95% CI 6 to 9; 19% from 42 mg consumed by participants given placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 65 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 4004 participants). Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (95% CI 10 to 15; 19% from 67 mg with placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 37 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 2449 participants). Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced pain at rest at 24 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (95% CI 4 to 7; 19% lower from 26/100 mm with placebo, high-quality evidence; 82 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 5004 participants), and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm (95% CI 3 to 7; 22% lower from 23/100 mm, high-quality evidence; 49 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 2962 participants). Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours (6/100 mm, 14% lower from 42/100 mm, moderate-quality evidence; 29 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 1806 participants), and 48 hours (6/100 mm, 16% lower from 37 mm, low-quality evidence; 23 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 1353 participants). Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity. No analysis by dose was possible. There was no difference when nitrous oxide (Any number of entities (members) considered as a unit.) was used. We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small-study effects likely but testing not possible. Ketamine (Excision of the uterus.) increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request by 54 minutes (95% CI 37 to 71 minutes), from a mean of 39 minutes with placebo (moderate-quality evidence; 31 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 1678 participants). Ketamine (Excision of the uterus.) reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia by 7 cm\u00b2 (95% CI \u221211.9 to \u22122.2), compared with placebo (very low-quality evidence; 7 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter) 333 participants). We downgraded the quality of evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400. CNS adverse event (deprived of oxygen.)s occurred in 52 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), while 53 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter) reported of absence of CNS adverse event (deprived of oxygen.)s. Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treat (Treatment of disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.)ment experienced an adverse event (deprived of oxygen.) (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4; high-quality evidence; 105 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 6538 participants). Ketamine (Excision of the uterus.) reduced postoperative nausea (Epileptiform activity refers to distinctive EEG waves or complexes distinguished from background activity found in in a proportion of human subjects with epilepsy, but which can also be found in subjects without seizures.) and vomiting (The induction of local hyperthermia by either short radio waves or high-frequency sound waves.) from 27% with placebo to 23% with ketamine (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96; the number needed to treat (Treatment of disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.) to prevent (The study of natural phenomena by observation, measurement, and experimentation.) one episode of postoperative nausea (Epileptiform activity refers to distinctive EEG waves or complexes distinguished from background activity found in in a proportion of human subjects with epilepsy, but which can also be found in subjects without seizures.) and vomiting (The induction of local hyperthermia by either short radio waves or high-frequency sound waves.) with perioperative intravenous ketamine administration was 24 (95% CI 16 to 54; high-quality evidence; 95 studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), 5965 participants). Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain intensity. Results were consistent in different operation types or timing of ketamine administration, with larger and smaller studies (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter), and by higher and lower pain intensity. CNS adverse event (deprived of oxygen.)s were little different with ketamine or control. Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative nausea (Epileptiform activity refers to distinctive EEG waves or complexes distinguished from background activity found in in a proportion of human subjects with epilepsy, but which can also be found in subjects without seizures.) and vomiting (The induction of local hyperthermia by either short radio waves or high-frequency sound waves.) by a small extent, of arguable clinical relevance.",

                "In July 2018 we searched for randomised clinical trials where ketamine was injected before, during, or after operation in adults having an operation under general anaesthesia. Important outcomes were opioid use and pain at 24 and 48 hours after the operation, time to first request for a painkiller, and ketamine-related side effects. We found 130 eligible studies with 8341 participants. Compared to people given control treatment, those given intravenous ketamine used less opioid painkiller (by about 1 part in 10), and had less pain (by about 2 parts in 10; moderate- or high-quality evidence). Ketamine may be more effective in operations that are likely to cause more intense pain. People given ketamine requested painkillers 54 minutes later than those who did not receive ketamine (moderate-quality evidence). Ketamine reduced the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small amount (high-quality evidence). Ketamine produced no increased risk of central nervous system side effects (hallucination, nightmares or double vision) (high-quality evidence). Future research should assess ketamine's effect after operations that are accompanied by intense pain such as thoracotomy, back surgery, or amputations. Additionally, assessing ketamine's effects among particular patient groups, for example, the elderly or individuals with a history of substance abuse would be of interest. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We found the quality of evidence for most outcomes to be moderate. Many of the studies were small, which was the main reason for downgrading the evidence from high to moderate. We tested the results by operation type, timing of ketamine injection, and by looking at larger studies, and those with more pain were consistent, and provided confidence in the results. There was sufficient evidence to allow conclusions about ketamine's effect on pain, painkiller consumption and side effects after operation."

No severe or systemic adverse effects were reported at doses of 13 to 15 \u00b5g of each antigen (The general condition of one's body.) (39 to 45 \u00b5g total). One small efficacy trial with 17 non-immune (Something distinguishable as an identifiable class based on common qualities.) participants with blood-stage parasites showed no reduction or delay in parasite growth rates after artificial challenge. In the second efficacy trial in 120 children aged five to nine years in Papua New Guinea, episodes of clinical malaria were not reduced, but MSP/RESA significantly reduced parasite density only in children who had not been pretreated with an antimalarial drug (The state of being free from intrusion or disturbance in one's private life or affairs.)

The MSP/RESA (Combination B) vaccine (Pathological processes involving the PERIODONTIUM including the gum (GINGIVA), the alveolar bone (ALVEOLAR PROCESS), the DENTAL CEMENTUM, and the PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT.) shows promise as a way to reduce the severity of malaria episodes, but the effect of the vaccine (Pathological processes involving the PERIODONTIUM including the gum (GINGIVA), the alveolar bone (ALVEOLAR PROCESS), the DENTAL CEMENTUM, and the PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT.) is MSP2 (An early local inflammatory reaction to insult or injury that consists of fever, an increase in inflammatory humoral factors, and an increased synthesis by hepatocytes of a number of proteins or glycoproteins usually found in the plasma.) variant-specific. Pretreatment for malaria during a vaccine (Pathological processes involving the PERIODONTIUM including the gum (GINGIVA), the alveolar bone (ALVEOLAR PROCESS), the DENTAL CEMENTUM, and the PERIODONTAL LIGAMENT.) trial makes the results difficult to interpret, particularly with the relatively small sample sizes of early trials.

Although all studies were blinded randomised placebo-controlled trials, each study had limitations. The primary measure of the clinical effectiveness of electromagnetic field stimulation was the proportion of participants whose fractures had united at a fixed time point. The overall pooled effect size was small and not statistically significant (risk ratio 1.96; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 4.48; 4 trials). There was substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity in this pooled analysis (I2 = 58%).

IUD expulsion (A highly vascularized mammalian fetal-maternal organ and major site of transport of oxygen, nutrients, and fetal waste products.) rates appear higher immediately after abortions compared to delayed insertion (Describes areas on an x-ray or CT scan that show up as whiter or brighter than normal.)s. However, at six months postabortion, IUD use is higher following immediate insertion (Describes areas on an x-ray or CT scan that show up as whiter or brighter than normal.) compared to delayed insertion (Describes areas on an x-ray or CT scan that show up as whiter or brighter than normal.).",

Trials could compare types of IUDs or times for insertion. We found 12 studies to include. Four trials randomised women to an IUD inserted right away or at a later time. One had no major difference. Three recent trials (of levonorgestrel intrauterine system or CuT380A) showed use was greater at six months for an IUD inserted right away compared to one inserted later. Another trial assigned women to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T; more women with the Nova T stopped use due to pregnancy. A subanalysis showed more IUDs came out when inserted right after abortion or miscarriage rather than later. Seven trials looked at inserting the IUD right away. From two large trials, the TCu 220C was better than the Lippes Loop and the Copper 7 for preventing pregnancy and staying in. The IUD was more likely to come out on its own when inserted after a mid-pregnancy abortion than after an earlier one. In other work, when the Lippes Loop had copper arms added, fewer women got pregnant and the IUD stayed in more often. Moderate level evidence shows that inserting an IUD right after an abortion or miscarriage is safe and practical. However, the IUD is more likely to come out when inserted right away rather than at a later time. Women are more likely to use an IUD at six months if they had it inserted right away compared to some weeks after the abortion or miscarriage."

Antibiotic prophylaxis (revealed to the subject and/or investigators conducting the clinical study.) was compared with no antibiotic (Postmortem examination of the body.) prophylaxis in one trial. All the trials were at high risk of bias. With the exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery; nor does it appear that there was high prevalence of MRSA carrier status in the people undergoing surgery. There was no sufficient clinical similarity between the trials to perform a meta-analysis. The overall all-cause mortality in four trials that reported mortality was 14/1401 (1.0%) and there were no significant differences in mortality between the intervention (A decapeptide that stimulates the synthesis and secretion of both pituitary gonadotropins, LUTEINIZING HORMONE and FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE.) and control groups in each of the individual comparisons.

Overall, 221/4032 (5.5%) people developed SSIs due to all organisms, and 46/4704 (1.0%) people developed SSIs due to MRSA. In the 15 comparisons that compared one antibiotic (Postmortem examination of the body.) regimen (The smaller lobe of the left lung, situated above and in front the oblique fissure, which includes the apex.) with another, there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed SSIs. In the single trial that compared an antibiotic (Postmortem examination of the body.) regimen (The smaller lobe of the left lung, situated above and in front the oblique fissure, which includes the apex.) with placebo, the proportion of people who developed SSIs was significantly lower in the group that received antibiotic (Postmortem examination of the body.) prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav (A benign tumor derived from smooth muscle tissue, also known as a fibroid tumor.)

To identify the best antibiotic(s), or dose pattern, for preventing development of MRSA infection after surgery, we investigated studies that compared different antibiotics with each other, or with no treatment, to prevent MRSA SSIs. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and set no limits regarding language, or date, of publication, or trial size. Two review authors identified studies and extracted data independently. We identified 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants. Eleven trials compared 16 preventative (prophylactic) antibiotic treatments, and one compared antibiotic prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Generally, MRSA status of the participants prior to surgery was not known. Four studies reported deaths (14/1401 participants): approximately 1% of participants died from any cause after surgery, but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Four trials reported on serious antibiotic-related adverse events - there were none in 561 participants. None of the trials reported quality of life, length of hospital stay or use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221 SSIs due to any bacterium developed in 4032 people (6%), and 46 MRSA SSIs developed in 4704 people (1%). There were no significant differences in development of SSIs between the 15 comparisons of one antibiotic treatment against another. When antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis, a significantly lower proportion of people developed SSIs after receiving co-amoxiclav (74% reduction in all SSIs, and 95% reduction in MRSA SSIs). Two trials reported that 19 participants developed MRSA infection in wounds (SSIs), chest, or bloodstream, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed them between the two comparisons. Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in people without cancer undergoing surgery for feeding tube insertion into the stomach using endoscopy, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence that either a combination of prophylactic antibiotics, or increased duration of antibiotic treatment, benefits people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections.

(standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to -0.17). Benefits of exercise on fatigue were observed for interventions delivered during or post-adjuvant cancer therapy. In relation to diagnosis (A period in a clinical study during which subjects receive induction therapy.), we identified benefits of exercise on fatigue for breast (Freedom from control or influence of another or others factors.) and prostate cancer (A currently accepted and widely used treatment for a certain type of disease, based on the results of past research.) but not for those with haematological malignancies. Finally, aerobic exercise significantly reduced fatigue but resistance training and alternative forms of exercise failed to reach significance. The findings of the updated review have enabled a more precise conclusion to be made in that aerobic exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with cancer-related fatigue during and post-cancer therapy, specifically those with solid tumours. Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity and timing of an exercise intervention.",

The current review was carried out to evaluate the effect of physical exercise on fatigue related to cancer. Fifty-six studies, involving a total of 4068 participants, were included in this review. Results suggest that physical exercise such as aerobic walking and aerobic cycling can help to reduce fatigue both during and after treatment for cancer.

            "input": "We screened 1796 records and identified five eligible trials in total i.e. one trial could be added on the previous review. These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). We included all five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses: the HD9 and HD14 trials were co-ordinated in Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials were performed in Italy and the EORTC 20012 was conducted in Belgium. The overall risk of performance and detection bias was low for overall survival (OS), but was high for other outcomes, as therapy blinding was not feasible. The remaining 'Risk of bias' domains were low and unclear. All trials reported results for OS and progression-free survival (PFS). In contrast to the our first published review (2011) the addition of results from the EORTC 20012 BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) escalated increases OS (3142 participants; HR 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.97; high-quality evidence). This means that only 90 (70 to 117) patients will die after five years in the BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) escalated arm compared to 120 in the ABVD arm. This survival advantage is also reflected in an increased PFS with BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) escalated (3142 participants; HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.64); moderate-quality evidence), meaning that after five years only 144 (121 to 168) patients will experience a progress, relapse or death in the BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) escalated arm compared to 250 in the ABVD arm. There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality (2700 participants, RR 2.15 (95% CI = 0.93 to 4.95), low-quality evidence). Although the occurrence of MDS or AML may increase with BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) escalated (3332 participants, RR 3.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 11.21); low-quality evidence)), there is no evidence for a difference between both regimens for overall secondary malignancies (amenable to surgical resection.) (A person who pays for goods or services.) (3332 participants, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.48), low-quality evidence). However, the observation time of the studies (A study that compares a group of participants receiving an intervention with a similar group from the past who did not.) included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours (Anti-inflammatory agents that are non-steroidal in nature.) which would not be expected to show significance until around 15 years after treatment. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile (The mass or quantity of heaviness of an individual.) due to chemotherapy (They are oval or bean shaped bodies (1 - 30 mm in diameter) located along the lymphatic system.) and which arm might be favoured (106 participants, RR 1.37 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.26), very low-quality evidence). This is a very small sample, and the age of the patients was not detailed. No analysis (A way of entering or leaving.) of male fertility was provided. Five trials reported adverse events (A radiologic finding that describes haziness around a bronchus or large bronchiole seen end on.) and the analysis (A way of entering or leaving.) shows that the escalated BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) regimens probably causes more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV ((anaemia: 2425 participants, RR 10.67 (95% CI 7.14 to 15.93); neutropenia: 519 participants, RR 1.80 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.13); thrombocytopenia (Hospital department responsible for the administration and provision of immediate medical or surgical care to the emergency patient.): 2425 participants, RR 18.12 (95% CI 11.77 to 27.92); infections (Any drug treatment modality designed to inhibit UTERINE CONTRACTION.): 2425 participants, RR 3.73 (95% CI 2.58 to 5.38), all low-quality evidence). Only one trial (EORTC 20012) planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported. This meta-analysis (A way of entering or leaving.) provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable and advanced stage HL (The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues.) benefit regarding OS and PFS from first-line chemotherapy (They are oval or bean shaped bodies (1 - 30 mm in diameter) located along the lymphatic system.) including escalated BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.). The proven benefit in OS for patients with advanced HL (The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues.) is a new finding (Redness of the skin produced by congestion of the capillaries.) of this updated review due to the inclusion of the results from the EORTC 20012 trial. Furthermore, there is only low-quality evidence of a difference in the total number of secondary malignancies (amenable to surgical resection.) (A person who pays for goods or services.), as the follow-up period might be too short to detect meaningful differences. Low-quality evidence also suggests that people treated with (The outer part of the hearing system of the body.) escalated BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) may have a higher risk to develop secondary AML (confined to one hemi-thorax and the regional lymph nodes.) or MDS. Due to the availability of only very low-quality evidence available, we are unable to come to a conclusion in terms of infertility. This review does for the first time suggest a survival benefit. However, it is clear from this review that BEACOPP (An assessment of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition where communication skills such as speech, language, listening, and conversation are evaluated.) escalated may be more toxic that ABVD, and very important long-term side effects of second malignancies (amenable to surgical resection.) and infertility have not been sufficiently analysed yet.",

For this updated review there are new data available resulting in a benefit in terms of overall survival (OS) for people with early unfavourable and advanced HL receiving BEACOPP escalated for first-line treatment. Furthermore, the analysis shows a better chance of avoiding recurrence of the tumour in patients who received chemotherapy including BEACOPP escalated. We analysed the following harms potentially caused by both regimens. There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality. There is evidence for a higher risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in patients receiving BEACOPP escalated, but the total number of secondary malignancies does not show evidence for a difference between both treatment groups. However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile due to chemotherapy and which arm might be favoured, as the evaluated sample is very small. No data for male patients and risk for infertility was provided. Treatment with BEACOPP escalated caused a higher risk of adverse events such as anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and infections. Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. One trial stated it would assess quality of life, however, there were no results reported. We assessed the quality of the evidence as high relating to overall survival, as moderate for progression-free survival and as low for secondary AML or MDS, secondary malignancies and treatment-related mortality and adverse events. The quality of evidence is very low for infertility."

Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interest. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged. Although not statistically significant using a strict P < 0.05 criterion, data were consistent with women allocated to admission CTG (A relatively thin sheetlike expanse or region lying over or under another.) having, on average, a higher probability of an increase in incidence of caesarean section (intended to prevent disease or alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.) than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (a plant or plant part used for its scent, flavor, or therapeutic properties.) (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.44, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I\u00b2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence).

There were no data reported for severe neurodevelopmental disability (involved in many metabolic processes.) assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age. Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the admission CTG (A relatively thin sheetlike expanse or region lying over or under another.) for low-risk women on admission in labour. Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG (A relatively thin sheetlike expanse or region lying over or under another.) increases the caesarean section (intended to prevent disease or alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.) rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG (A relatively thin sheetlike expanse or region lying over or under another.) not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour. Women should be informed that admission CTG (A relatively thin sheetlike expanse or region lying over or under another.) is likely associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section (intended to prevent disease or alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.) without evidence of benefit. Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel.

Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG (A relatively thin sheetlike expanse or region lying over or under another.) should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and before a formal diagnosis (Monitoring a person's health over time after treatment.) of labour.

This review includes four studies and there is one study that is not yet complete. The included studies (carried out in the UK and Ireland) involved more than 13,000 women with low-risk pregnancies. Three trials were funded by the hospitals were the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. Women allocated to admission CTG were probably more likely to have a caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of instrumental vaginal births (low quality evidence) or in numbers of babies who died during or shortly after labour (moderate quality evidence) between women in the two groups. Admission CTG was associated with an increase in the use of continuous EFM (with an electrode placed on the baby\u2019s scalp) (low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (a small blood sample taken from a baby's scalp) during labour. There were no differences in other outcomes measured such as artificial rupture of the membranes, augmentation of labour, use of an epidural, damage to the baby's brain due to lack of oxygen (very low quality evidence), or the baby having fits or seizures just after birth (low quality evidence). No studies reported if the babies developed any severe problems in brain or central nervous system growth and development after one year of age. Although many hospitals carry out CTGs on women when they are admitted to hospital in labour, we found no evidence that this benefits women with low-risk pregnancies. We found that admission CTGs may increase numbers of women having a caesarean section by about 20%. The included studies did not include enough women to show if admission CTGs or intermittent auscultation were better at keeping babies safe. However, studies to show which is better at keeping babies safe would have to be very large. Based on this review, low-risk pregnant women who have an admission CTG could be more likely to have a caesarean section. The benefits to these women of having an admission CTG are not certain. All of the included studies took place in developed Western European countries. The review findings might not be useful to people in very different countries or where different ways of FHR monitoring are used. However, countries that use admission CTGs should start to question why, because there are not clear benefits to using admission CTGs, and they could be causing women harm by making them more likely to have a caesarean section."

This Cochrane review suggests a modest to moderate benefit for psychological intervention (Individuals who leave school, secondary or college, prior to completion of specified curriculum requirements.)s, particularly those using a cognitive-behavioural framework, which was largely restricted to the first three months after the intervention (Individuals who leave school, secondary or college, prior to completion of specified curriculum requirements.). Hypnotherapy is also a possible alternative. However, these conclusions are limited by high heterogeneity in many of the results and low numbers of participants in individual studies (An achromatic color of any lightness between the extremes of black and white.). The evidence for other brief intervention (Individuals who leave school, secondary or college, prior to completion of specified curriculum requirements.)s was less clear.

For the other comparisons, the evidence for difference was either based on single small trials or there was no evidence of differences. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or time needed to return to work. Paucity of data meant that we could not assess transitivity assumptions and inconsistency for most analyses. When direct and indirect comparisons were available, network meta-analysis provided additional effect estimates for comparisons where there were no direct comparisons. However, the paucity of data decreases the confidence in the results of the network meta-analysis. Low-quality evidence suggests that liver resection (Devices designed to provide protection against injury.) using a radiofrequency dissecting sealer may be associated with more adverse events (The act or process of developing or preparing a mixture of ingredients to create a desired end drug product, such as a specific flavor, aroma, or polymer; or the desired final drug product itself; also, a listing of the ingredients and composition of the dosage form.) than with the clamp-crush method. Low-quality evidence also suggests that the proportion of people requiring a blood transfusion is higher with low central venous pressure than with acute normovolemic haemodilution plus low central venous pressure; very low-quality evidence suggests that blood transfusion quantity (red blood cells) was lower with fibrin sealant than control; blood transfusion quantity (fresh frozen plasma) was higher with oxidised cellulose (Skin breakdown or ulceration in the drainage area of a VARICOSE VEIN, usually in the leg.) than with fibrin sealant; and blood loss, total hospital stay, and operating time were lower with low central venous pressure than with control. There is no evidence to suggest that using special equipment for liver resection (Devices designed to provide protection against injury.) is of any benefit in decreasing the mortality, morbidity, or blood transfusion requirements (very low-quality evidence). Radiofrequency dissecting sealer should not be used outside the clinical trial setting since there is low-quality evidence for increased harm without any evidence of benefits.

Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The choice of whether the participants received local anaesthetic agents (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in people who were as similar as possible. There were no deaths in either group in eight trials (446 participants) that reported deaths. The studies reported very few or no serious complications in the groups. There were no local anaesthetic-related complications in nearly 1000 participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration in the different trials that reported complications. None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work. The small differences in hospital stay between the two groups were imprecise. Pain scores were lower in the participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration compared with those who received controls at four to eight hours and at nine to 24 hours as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10). Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that means that there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the study was conducted. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low. Serious adverse event rates were low in studies evaluating local anaesthetic intra-abdominal administration (very low quality evidence). There is very low quality evidence that local anaesthetic intra-abdominal administration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

                "Standard diagnosis of malaria in the past has depended on blood microscopy, but this requires a technician and a laboratory, and is often not feasible for basic health services in many areas. Sometimes in research studies, another technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used, but again this requires equipment and trained staff, and cannot be used routinely. Technological advances have led to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. These detect parasite-specific antigens in the blood, are simple to use, and can give results as a simple positive or negative result, within 15 minutes. This review evaluates the accuracy of RDTs compared with microscopy and PCR for detecting Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the blood. It includes 74 studies, giving a total of 111 RDT evaluations (of which 104 compared RDTs with microscopy), reporting a total of 60,396 RDT results. Results are presented by type of test, classified by the malaria antigen that they are designed to detect (either histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), or plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)). The results indicate that RDTs can be very accurate compared to microscopy and PCR. The performance of RDT types varied but the differences were not large. HRP-2-based tests tended to be more sensitive (ie they identified more true cases of malaria) and less specific (ie they wrongly identified more malaria that was not present) than pLDH-based tests. Choice will depend on prevalence of malaria, and we provide data in this review to assist these decisions, although policy makers will also take into account other factors relating to cost and test stability."

The choice of which antidepressant (A group forming a type within a larger type.) and/or benzodiazepine is prescribed can not be made on the basis of this review only, and should be based on evidence of antidepressant (A group forming a type within a larger type.)s (normally contained.) and benzodiazepines (Relating to human society and its members.) efficacy and tolerability, including data from placebo-controlled studies (supported by the nose and ears.), as a whole. Data on long-term tolerability issues associated with antidepressant (A group forming a type within a larger type.)s (normally contained.) and benzodiazepines (Relating to human society and its members.) exposure should also be carefully considered. The present review highlights the need for further higher-quality studies (supported by the nose and ears.) comparing antidepressant (A group forming a type within a larger type.)s (normally contained.) with benzodiazepines (Relating to human society and its members.), which should be conducted with high-methodological standards and including pragmatic outcome measures to provide clinicians with useful and practical data.

Studies with larger sample sizes and fewer risks of bias should be carried out, with head-to-head comparisons.

Polyethylene stents and stainless-steel alloy stents (Wallstent) are the most studied stents."

Four RCTs compared ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) with palpation, and one compared ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) with Doppler auditory assistance. Risk of bias varied across studies (severely limited, who are frequently subjected to COERCION in their DECISION MAKING, or who may be compromised in their ability to give INFORMED CONSENT.), with some studies (severely limited, who are frequently subjected to COERCION in their DECISION MAKING, or who may be compromised in their ability to give INFORMED CONSENT.) lacking details of allocation concealment. It was not possible to blind practitioners in all of the included studies (severely limited, who are frequently subjected to COERCION in their DECISION MAKING, or who may be compromised in their ability to give INFORMED CONSENT.); this adds a performance bias that is inherent to the type of intervention (Blockage of a passageway.) studied in our review. Only two studies (severely limited, who are frequently subjected to COERCION in their DECISION MAKING, or who may be compromised in their ability to give INFORMED CONSENT.) reported the rate of complications (A highly acidic mucopolysaccharide formed of equal parts of sulfated D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid with sulfaminic bridges.). Meta-analysis showed that ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) guidance produces superior success rates at first attempt (risk ratio (RR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34 to 2.85, 404 catheters (A change in disposition or state of mind.), four RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) and fewer complications (A highly acidic mucopolysaccharide formed of equal parts of sulfated D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid with sulfaminic bridges.), such as haematoma (Violence inflicted on an individual through physical contact.) formation (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.60, 222 catheters (A change in disposition or state of mind.), two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence). Our results suggest, but do not confirm, that a possible advantage of ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) guidance for the first attempt success rate over other techniques is more pronounced in infants and small children than in older children. Similarly, our results suggest, but do not confirm, the possibility of a positive influence of expertise in the use of ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) on the first attempt success rate. We also found improved success rates within two attempts (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.51, 134 catheters (A change in disposition or state of mind.), two RCTs, moderate-quality evidence) with ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) guidance compared with other types of guidance. No studies (severely limited, who are frequently subjected to COERCION in their DECISION MAKING, or who may be compromised in their ability to give INFORMED CONSENT.) reported data about ischaemic damage. We rated the quality of evidence for all outcomes as moderate owing to imprecision due to wide confidence intervals, modest sample sizes and limited numbers of events. We identified moderate-quality evidence suggesting that ultrasound (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) guidance for radial artery cannulation improves first and second attempt success rates and decreases the rate of complications (A highly acidic mucopolysaccharide formed of equal parts of sulfated D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid with sulfaminic bridges.) as compared with palpation or Doppler auditory assistance. The improved success rate at the first attempt may be more pronounced in infants and small children, in whom arterial line cannulation is more challenging than in older children.",

                "The evidence is current to January 2016. We found five eligible studies - four comparing ultrasound with palpation and one comparing ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. We included in the review children aged one month to 18 years. We found that ultrasound increased the rate of successful cannulation at the first attempt and reduced the formation of haematomas. Ultrasound also increased the success rate within two attempts. It is likely that ultrasound is more useful for infants and small children than for older children. It is also likely that ultrasound is more useful if the practitioner is experienced in its use. We noted variation in the risk of bias of included studies. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate mainly because the number of studies was limited. For the same reason, we could not confirm the effect of age and expertise in ultrasound usage. Our evidence suggests that ultrasound is superior to other techniques for arterial catheter insertion, particularly in babies and young children."

            "input": "We included one small RCT (80 male student participants conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009) and three ITS studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) (general population studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) in Canadian provinces conducted in the 1970s and 80s). The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with a low-alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) content drank less than men exposed to movies with a high-alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) content (mean difference (MD) -0.65 drinks; 95% CI -1.2, -0.07; p value = 0.03, very-low-quality evidence). Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) drank less (Infections resulting from the use of catheters.) (MD -0.73 drinks; 95% CI -1.30, -0.16; p value = 0.01, very-low-quality evidence). Outcomes were assessed immediately after the end of the intervention (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) (lasting 1.5 hours), so no follow-up data were available. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to a serious risk of bias, serious indirectness of the included population and serious level of imprecision. Two of the ITS studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) evaluated the implementation of an advertising ban and one study evaluated the lifting of such a ban. Each of the three ITS studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) evaluated a different type of ban (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period. The results from the three ITS studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of the two studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) that evaluated the implementation of a ban showed an overall mean non-significant increase in beer consumption in the general population of 1.10% following the ban (95% CI -5.26, 7.47; p value = 0.43; I2 = 83%, very-low-quality evidence). This finding is consistent with an increase, no difference, or a decrease in alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) consumption. In the study evaluating the lifting of a total ban on all forms of alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) advertising to a partial ban on spirits advertising only, which utilised an Abrupt Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average model, the volume of all forms of alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) sales decreased by 11.11 kilolitres (95% CI -27.56, 5.34; p value = 0.19) per month after the ban was lifted. In this model, beer and wine sales increased per month by 14.89 kilolitres (95% CI 0.39, 29.39; p value = 0.04) and 1.15 kilolitres (95% CI -0.91, 3.21; p value = 0.27), respectively, and spirits sales decreased statistically significantly by 22.49 kilolitres (95% CI -36.83, -8.15; p value = 0.002). Using the GRADE approach, the evidence from the ITS studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) was rated as very low due to a high risk of bias arising from a lack of randomisation and imprecision in the results. No other prespecified outcomes (including economic loss or hardship due to decreased alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) sales) were addressed in the included studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) and no adverse effects were reported in any of the studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.). None of the studies (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) were funded by the alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) or advertising industries. There is a lack of robust evidence for or against recommending the implementation of alcohol (Gentle or temperate in nature or degree.) advertising restrictions. Advertising restrictions should be implemented within a high-quality, well-monitored research programme to ensure the evaluation over time of all relevant outcomes in order to build the evidence base.",

                "The evidence we present is current to May 2014. We found four studies that evaluated the restriction or banning of alcohol advertising via any format. One was a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated drinking behaviour in 80 young men in the Netherlands exposed to movies with either a high or low alcohol content combined with a commercial with either a neutral content (interpreted as a ban on alcohol advertising) or a high alcohol content. The other three studies were interrupted time series (ITS) studies. ITS studies are studies in which changes, usually in the general public, are measured at various points before, during and after an intervention such as a change in policy. Two of the three ITS studies evaluated what happened after an advertising ban was introduced by two different Canadian provincial governments. The third ITS study evaluated what happened after a ban was lifted after being in place for 50 years in another Canadian province. Each study evaluated a different category of ban (either partial or full). None of the above studies were funded by the alcohol or advertising industries. The data arising from the included studies did not show a clear effect either for or against the banning or restriction of alcohol advertising. In the RCT, young men who watched movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men who watched movies with a high-alcohol content. Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol drank less. The trial was one and a half hours, so we do not know how long beyond the trial these effects lasted. The trial did not report on any harmful outcomes. The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent. We statistically combined the results of the two studies that assessed what happened after a ban was introduced. This showed an overall increase in beer consumption in the general population following the introduction of the ban, but the results were uncertain and could also be consistent with no difference or an overall decrease in alcohol consumption. The third ITS study, which evaluated the lifting of a total ban on all forms of alcohol advertising to a ban on spirits advertising only, also found uncertain results. None of the studies reported on any harms arising from the bans. Overall we judged the quality of evidence to be very low in the RCT. This was based on the fact that there were problems with the study methodology, the population included men only and the results were not very accurate. In the ITS studies, the quality was also judged to be very low due to problems with the study methodology and the results not being precise. The review cannot recommend for or against banning alcohol advertising. Governments that are considering implementing alcohol advertising bans would be advised to implement the ban in a research environment and monitor the effects over time to build the evidence base."

Similarly, meta-analysis of weight gain in g/d based on two studies showed no evidence of difference (WMD 2.09 g/d, 95% CI -1.46, 5.64). Length gain, based on five studies, showed a non-significant WMD of 0.14 cm/wk (95% CI -0.04, 0.31). Head circumference gain, based on data from five studies, showed a non-significant WMD -0.03 cm/wk (95% CI -0.15, 0.08). Only one study reported a statistically non-significant skin fold thickness gain, with a mean difference -0.15 mm/wk (95% CI -0.41, 0.11). Subgroup analyses according to % MCT in the high MCT formula, by 10% intervals showed no evidence of effect of high MCT on short-term weight gain within any subgroup.

For those outcomes we assessed using GRADE (postpartum endometritis (Affecting both the right and left sides of the body.), neonatal infection, and caesarean section (Frequent, loose, and watery stools are noted in most infants, even if they are fed formula, until they are six to eight weeks old; after that, the stools become firmer and less frequent.)), we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low - with downgrading decisions based on small numbers and a lack of information on blinding. The included study did not report on this review's other primary outcome (perinatal death or severe morbidity). The reduction in pyrexia, though not a pre-specified outcome of this review, may be of relevance in terms of benefits to the fetus of reduced exposure to heat. We postulate that the temperature reduction found may be a direct cooling effect of amnioinfusion (A boundary line or the area immediately inside the boundary.)

Themother's temperature at delivery, which was not a pre-defined outcome for our review, was lower in the women who received amnioinfusion, by 0.38 \u00b0C (with a likely range of 0.74 lower to 0.02 lower). The outcomedeath or severe illness in the babywas not reported, nor did the study report on the number of babies with alow Apgar scoreafter they were born (a low Apgar score could indicate that the baby is in need of medical attention). Similarly, the majority of other outcomes listed in this review were not reported in the included study. We did not identify any studies that looked at introducing the solution through the mother's abdomen (transabdominal route). There is not enough evidence to support the use of amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis in clinical practice. We suggest that the reduction in temperature may have been in part due to a direct cooling effect of the infused fluid, and that further research is justified to determine whether such a cooling effect may be beneficial for the baby. Further randomised controlled trials are needed in this area. Future trials should compare transabdominal or transcervical amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion for women with pregnancy fluid and sac infection (chorioamnionitis) and report on important outcomes listed in this review."

These studies compared amphetamines to placebo (something that looks like an amphetamine but with no active ingredient), and three studies also compared amphetamines with other drugs such as guanfacine, modafinil, and paroxetine. In this review, we assessed the effects of three different kinds of amphetamines: dexamphetamine (from 10.2 to 21.8 mg/d), lisdexamfetamine (from 30 to 70 mg/d), and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) (from 12.5 to 80 mg/d). Treatment length ranged from one to 20 weeks. Eighteen studies were conducted in the USA and one study in Canada and the USA. Ten studies were conducted at multiple sites. Study funding was reported in all but two studies. Sixteen studies were funded by the manufacturer, and one was funded by government agencies. All amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by patients. Lisdexamfetamine and MAS also reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians, but dexamphetamine did not. Overall, amphetamines did not make people more likely to stay in treatment and were associated with higher risk of treatment ending early as the result of adverse events. We found no evidence suggesting that higher doses worked better than lower ones. We did not find any difference in effectiveness between amphetamines that act for longer periods of time versus those that act for shorter periods of time. Therefore, it appears that short-term treatment with amphetamines reduces the severity of ADHD symptoms, but studies assessing the effects of amphetamines for longer periods of time are needed. We found no differences in effectiveness between amphetamines and guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes for several reasons, namely, it was possible for patients to know the treatment they were taking; the number of studies and included patients was low, leading to imprecise results for many outcomes; the studies had problems in their design; and, for some outcomes, results varied across trials."

It was important to do this review as it is not known whether or not PTCRA provides greater benefits to patients compared to balloon angioplasty. The review analysed data from 12 studies, which showed that there is limited evidence to support the routine use of PTCRA for in-stent re-stenosis; however, only for those people who were not suitable for surgery. For those with complex lesions, PTCRA may provide some benefit in comparison to balloon angioplasty. The review also showed that patients receiving PTCRA were more likely to have perforations during the procedure compared to patients receiving balloon angioplasty. This review was limited by the small number of studies and deficiency of data reported in some of the studies."

The other trial involved 120 women with pregnancy assisted by in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer who continued treatment until the completed 12th week of gestation. From the little evidence available, the two trials found no evidence that combined oestrogen and progestogen can prevent miscarriage (progestogen is a major class of hormones which includes progesterone) when compared with placebo or usual care. The first of the two studies indicated an increased risk for the mothers who used hormonal therapy during pregnancy of developing cancer later in life. Diethylstilboestrol is no longer in use and poses serious adverse effects while ethisterone contains androgenic properties thought to be responsible for genital abnormalities and has been replaced by progesterone. Overall, we acknowledge the lack of trials, especially large-scale trials, and therefore suggest further research is needed in this area before supporting or disproving the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for the prevention of miscarriages."

There has been doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care, and hence the impetus to do this review. Through extensive searches of the literature we found 14 studies conducted in adults (not the elderly) in primary care setting, in which tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were compared against a placebo control group in the treatment of depression. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were effective for depression. Most of the studies were supported by funds from pharmaceutical companies and were of short duration. There appeared to be more adverse effects with TCAs than with SSRIs, however rates of withdrawal from study medication due to adverse effects were very similar between the two antidepressant classes. Adverse effects not leading to medication cessation seemed to be more common with TCAs than SSRIs."

For the prespecified index tests (Female germ cells derived from OOGONIA and termed OOCYTES when they enter MEIOSIS.), we found six studies for the Mallampati test, 105 for the modified Mallampati test, six for the Wilson risk score, 52 for thyromental distance, 18 for sternomental distance, 34 for the mouth opening test, and 30 for the upper lip bite test (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.). Difficult face mask ventilation was the reference standard in seven studies, difficult laryngoscopy (revealed to the subject and/or investigators conducting the clinical study.) in 92 studies, difficult tracheal (responsible for managing or operating a business, organization, team or department.) intubation (primarily used as a bronchodilator agent to treat ASTHMA.) in 50 studies, and failed intubation in two studies. Across all studies, we judged the risk of bias to be variable for the different domains; we mostly observed low risk of bias for patient selection, flow and timing, and unclear risk of bias for reference standard and index test. Applicability concerns were generally low for all domains. For difficult laryngoscopy (revealed to the subject and/or investigators conducting the clinical study.), the summary sensitivity ranged from 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.33; mouth opening test) to 0.67 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.83; upper lip bite test (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)) and the summary specificity ranged from 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.85; modified Mallampati test) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; Wilson risk score).

Pregabalin (higher than the head.) increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain (Pertaining to the combined microscopic physical features of cells and their surrounding extracellular environment in tissues.) intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)). Substantial benefit with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.), but about 9% more with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence). Pregabalin (higher than the head.) increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain (Pertaining to the combined microscopic physical features of cells and their surrounding extracellular environment in tissues.) intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence). Moderate benefit with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.), but about 11% more with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence). A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'. NNT (A vasoconstrictor found in ergot of Central Europe.)s for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence). A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.), and concluded there was no difference in effect. Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration (A common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded erythematous, dry, scaling patches.), 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain (Pertaining to the combined microscopic physical features of cells and their surrounding extracellular environment in tissues.) relief (Monitoring a person's health over time after treatment.) after titration (A common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded erythematous, dry, scaling patches.) were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) daily) or a short down-titration (A common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded erythematous, dry, scaling patches.) to placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.) for 13 or 26 weeks. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. Of those randomised, 40% had MTR with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) and 20% with placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.) (high quality evidence). The NNT (A vasoconstrictor found in ergot of Central Europe.) was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. MTR had no imputation concerns. The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events. Specific adverse events were more common with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) than placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.), in particular dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema (Individuals licensed to practice DENTISTRY.), with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence). Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.) (very low quality evidence). Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) than placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.) only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design. Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with pregabalin (This gene plays a role in the regulation of ion transport.) than placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.), but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence). Pregabalin (higher than the head.) 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain (Pertaining to the combined microscopic physical features of cells and their surrounding extracellular environment in tissues.) intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo (A heparin fraction with a mean molecular weight of 4500 daltons.)) with moderate or severe pain (Pertaining to the combined microscopic physical features of cells and their surrounding extracellular environment in tissues.) due to fibromyalgia. The degree of pain (Pertaining to the combined microscopic physical features of cells and their surrounding extracellular environment in tissues.) relief (Monitoring a person's health over time after treatment.) is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function. These results are similar to other effective medicines (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) in fibromyalgia (milnacipran, duloxetine).",

The treatment had to last at least eight weeks. The evidence is current to March 2016. Eight studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, including three new studies for this update. Five studies randomised 3283 participants to immediate treatment with pregabalin or placebo. Two studies identified 687 out of 1492 participants who had a good pain response and could take the medicine, and then randomised them to continued treatment with pregabalin or placebo. Study quality was good. One other had no useful data. High quality evidence showed that 1 in 10 people with moderate or severe fibromyalgia pain reported a large fall in pain by a third to a half over 12 to 26 weeks. This is an outcome that people with fibromyalgia consider to be useful. The dose of pregabalin was 300 to 600 mg daily. Side effects occurred in 8 or 9 people in 10, often while adjusting to the medicine. Particular side effects were dizziness (affecting 1 in 4 participants), drowsiness (1 in 7), weight gain (1 in 18), and peripheral oedema (1 in 19) (high quality evidence). Serious side effects were no more common with pregabalin than with placebo, affecting 1 or 2 in 100. About 1 in 10 more participants taking pregabalin withdrew from the study because of side effects, and 1 in 17 fewer withdrew because the medicine was not working. The evidence was mostly of high quality, which means we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect in this review. Concern about how information was handled when people left the studies was offset by other information showing that results were not impacted by this to any important degree."

Regardless of the high risk of performance bias these studies were included based on the low weight the studies had in the meta-analysis (A decapeptide that stimulates the synthesis and secretion of both pituitary gonadotropins, LUTEINIZING HORMONE and FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE.). We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day, 60-day or ICU mortality). We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies) separately as subgroups for meta-analysis (A decapeptide that stimulates the synthesis and secretion of both pituitary gonadotropins, LUTEINIZING HORMONE and FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE.). The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality for the studies of general intensive care patients was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.09) and for the studies of high-risk surgery patients the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29). Of the eight studies of high-risk surgery patients, five evaluated the effectiveness of pre-operative optimization but there was no difference in mortality when these studies were examined separately. PAC (Any act or phenomena, or behavior, constituting a reply or reaction of a living organism or its part to some foregoing stimulus or agent.) did not affect general ICU LOS (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies).

We analysed the studies for any trial related risks and performed appropriate statistical analysis to minimize any risk of bias or errors. The quality of evidence is high from this review and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect except for cost analysis.

Two US studies were analysed for hospital cost associated with or without a PAC and showed no difference in the cost. Neither group of patients studied showed any evidence of benefit or harm from using a PAC. The catheter is a monitoring tool that helps in diagnosis and is not a treatment modality. Insertion of PACs to help make treatment decisions in ICU patients should be individualized and should be done by experts in the field after adequate training in the interpretation of data.

Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention (decreased synthesis of one or more hemoglobin polypeptide chains.) is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.). Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies (A method that provides the entirety of the nucleotide sequence of a specific DNA strand, allowing for reliable and thorough genotyping of the allele in question.) for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD (Rare chronic inflammatory disease involving the small blood vessels.) catheters. On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention (decreased synthesis of one or more hemoglobin polypeptide chains.) over the use of pharmaceutical agents (A disinfectant and topical anti-infective agent used also as mouthwash to prevent oral plaque.) in the acute setting. Pharmacological intervention (decreased synthesis of one or more hemoglobin polypeptide chains.)s appear to have a bridging role and long-term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.). The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical industry involvement. Further research is required to adequately address the question of the most efficacious and clinically appropriate technique for HD (Rare chronic inflammatory disease involving the small blood vessels.) catheter dysfunction.",

The quality of evidence is limited by small study size and high risk of bias. Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction. Catheter patency at two weeks is probably better following fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange compared to thrombolytic agent. Catheter exchange may be better than sheath disruption for long-term catheter survival and the use of both techniques together is probably best. There is currently insufficient evidence favouring any technique in terms of either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events.

This was from a cancer centre in the USA, looking at glioblastoma patients (those with the most aggressive gliomas) who had been treated between 2006 and 2016. The study involved 125 people and split them into those scanned within two days of surgery (early scan) with those who were not. They showed that doing the early scan made no change to the chance of being alive at one and two years after diagnosis. This might have been because the early scans were not used to change treatments, which mainly were to receive standard radiotherapy and temozolomide, and we could not tell if the patients' surgeon(s) were different or had different approaches to care. We judged this suggestion of little change in survival time with or without early scanning to be very uncertain. The number of people included over 10 years was small, and the decision whether or not to have a scan after surgery was based on surgeon's choice. It was not clear whether the surgeon(s) involved or their approaches to care differed, nor whether a person's care might have been changed in light of early imaging. The other search did not find any studies looking at the value of different imaging approaches. We still do not know whether doing scans regularly at specific times after glioma diagnosis changes how well patients do. The limited evidence, suggesting early scans after operations do not affect survival, is unreliable and more research is needed, especially as early scans may also help surgeons improve their practice, and decide whether to repeat the operation earlier than they might otherwise have chosen to do. The best timings and reasons for scanning brain gliomas in adults are not known. Lessons might be learned from studies involving children, and by looking at large collections of clinical trials.

Data were available for only two of our seven prestated main outcomes. Clinically important improvement in global state was measured using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI (The time frame after a meal or FOOD INTAKE.)). There was no clear difference between chlorpromazine (Habitual, repeated, rapid contraction of certain muscles, resulting in stereotyped individualized actions that can be voluntarily suppressed for only brief periods.) and metiapine (Pathological processes of the VESTIBULAR LABYRINTH which contains part of the balancing apparatus.) groups (2 RCTs, n = 120, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47, very low quality evidence) and numbers of participants with parkinsonism (spread widely throughout the body, or, in some cases, to a relatively large region of the body.) at eight weeks were similar (2 RCTs, n = 70, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.03, very low quality evidence). There were no useable data available for the other key outcomes of clinically important improvement in mental state, readmission due to relapse, satisfaction with treatment, aggressive or violent behaviour, or cost of care. Chlorpromazine (the defining agonist for the NMDA receptor subtype of glutamate receptors (RECEPTORS, NMDA).) has been the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia (Refraining from SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.) for decades, yet available evidence comparing this drug to metiapine (Pathological processes of the VESTIBULAR LABYRINTH which contains part of the balancing apparatus.) fails to provide high-quality trial based data. However, the need to determine whether metiapine (Pathological processes of the VESTIBULAR LABYRINTH which contains part of the balancing apparatus.) is more or less effective than chlorpromazine (Habitual, repeated, rapid contraction of certain muscles, resulting in stereotyped individualized actions that can be voluntarily suppressed for only brief periods.) seems to be lacking in clinical relevance and future research on this comparison seems unlikely.",

                "In November 2015, the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia group searched their specialised register for relevant clinical trials. The search identified four reports. We inspected these reports and found they referred to three trials, randomising people with schizophrenia to receive chlorpromazine or metiapine. Main results Our review now includes three studies with 161 participants. The studies revealed no real differences between chlorpromazine and metiapine for improvement in global state or incidence of parkinsonism (an umbrella term for symptoms such as tremor (shaking), bradykinesia (slow movement), rigidity (stiffness), and postural instability (difficulty in balancing). No data were reported for our other main areas of interest: mental state, service use, satisfaction with treatment, behaviour or cost of care. Conclusions We cannot draw firm conclusions from the data provided. The number of studies and number of participants in each study is small, all studies are also short term. Therefore, we rated the reported evidence as very low quality. However, metiapine is not a highly prescribed or used antipsychotic medicine, so although our evidence is poor, it probably will remain the best available evidence as it is unlikely new trials comparing metiapine with chlorpromazine will be conducted in the future."

Two studies (A standardized 10-item self-report scale that was developed by Cox et al 1987 to assist health professionals in identifying possible symptoms of depression in the postnatal period.) were considered in two comparisons. There were no data for the secondary outcome, alcohol-related harm (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.). The results were as follows. Comparison 1: cognitive-behavioural (The percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment.) coping skills training versus twelve-step programme (one study, 41 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol abstinence assessed with Substance Abuse Calendar (Lower than normal levels of magnesium in the circulating blood.) and breathalyser at one year: risk ratio (RR) 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10 to 55.06); and retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.62 to 1.29), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was very low. Comparison 2: brief intervention versus treatment as usual (three studies (A standardized 10-item self-report scale that was developed by Cox et al 1987 to assist health professionals in identifying possible symptoms of depression in the postnatal period.), 197 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured as scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) at three months: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.37); and retention in treatment, measured at three months: RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.13), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.

Comparison 3: motivational interviewing versus treatment as usual or educational intervention only (three studies (A standardized 10-item self-report scale that was developed by Cox et al 1987 to assist health professionals in identifying possible symptoms of depression in the postnatal period.), 462 participants) There was no significant difference between groups for either of the primary outcomes (alcohol use, measured as scores on the AUDIT or ASSIST at three months: SMD 0.04 (95% CI -0.29 to 0.37); and retention in treatment, measured at three months: RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.43), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.

There was no difference between groups for the other primary outcome, retention in treatment, measured at end of treatment: RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.02), or for any of the secondary outcomes reported.

                "We found seven studies that examined five talking therapies among 825 people with drug problems. Cognitive-behavioural coping skills training (CBCST) is a talking therapy that focuses on changing the way people think and act. The twelve-step programme is based on theories from Alcoholics Anonymous and aims to motivate the person to develop a desire to stop using drugs or alcohol. Motivational interviewing (MI) helps people to explore and resolve doubts about changing their behaviour. It can be delivered in group, individual and intensive formats. Brief motivational interviewing (BMI) is a shorter MI that takes 45 minutes to three hours. Brief interventions are based on MI but they take only five to 30 minutes and are often delivered by a non-specialist. Six of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health or by the Health Research Board; one study did not report its funding source. We found that the talking therapies led to no differences, or only small differences, for the outcomes assessed. These included abstinence, reduced drinking, and substance use. One study found that there may be no difference between CBCST and the twelve-step programme. Three studies found that there may be no difference between brief intervention and usual treatment. Three studies found that there may be no difference between MI and usual treatment or education only. One study found that BMI is probably better at reducing alcohol use than usual treatment (needle exchange), but found no differences in other outcomes. One study found that intensive MI may be somewhat better than standard MI at reducing severity of alcohol use disorder among women, but not among men and found no differences in other outcomes. It remains uncertain whether talking therapies reduce alcohol and drug use in people who also have problems with other drugs. High-quality studies are missing and are needed. The quality of the evidence was moderate for brief and intensive motivational interviewing, but low for brief interventions and standard motivational interviewing, and very low for CBCST versus twelve-step programme."

Quinine (Use of an inactive compound identical in appearance to drug or treatment being tested in experimental research, which may or may not be known to the physician and/or subject, administered to distinguish between drug action and suggestive effect of the drug or treatment under study.) was compared to placebo (used as a source of iodine in thyrotoxic crisis and in the preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.) (20 trials, n = 1140), vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) (four trials, n = 543), a quinine-vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) combination (three trials, n = 510), a quinine-theophylline (The amount of force generated by MUSCLE CONTRACTION.) combination (one trial, n = 77), and xylocaine injections into the gastrocnemius (well differentiated.) muscle (one trial, n = 24). The most commonly used quinine dosage was 300 mg/day (range 200 to 500 mg). We found no new trials for inclusion when searches were updated in 2014. The risk of bias in the trials varied considerably. All 23 trials claimed to be randomised, but only a minority described randomisation and allocation concealment adequately. Compared to placebo (used as a source of iodine in thyrotoxic crisis and in the preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.), quinine significantly reduced cramp number over two weeks by 28%, cramp intensity by 10%, and cramp days by 20%. Cramp (Recording of information on magnetic or punched paper tape.) duration was not significantly affected. A significantly greater number of people suffered minor adverse events (The preferred standard treatment for a particular condition.) (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) on quinine than placebo (used as a source of iodine in thyrotoxic crisis and in the preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.) (risk difference (RD) 3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0% to 6%), mainly gastrointestinal symptoms. Overdoses of quinine have been reported elsewhere to cause potentially fatal adverse effects, but in the included trials there was no significant difference in major adverse events (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) compared with placebo (used as a source of iodine in thyrotoxic crisis and in the preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.) (RD 0%, 95% CI -1% to 2%). One participant suffered from thrombocytopenia (0.12% risk) on quinine. A quinine-vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) combination, vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) alone, and xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius (well differentiated.) were not significantly different to quinine across all outcomes, including adverse effects. Based on a single trial comparison, quinine alone was significantly less effective than a quinine-theophylline (The amount of force generated by MUSCLE CONTRACTION.) combination but with no significant differences in adverse events (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.). There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that with use up to 60 days, the incidence of serious adverse events (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) is not significantly greater than for placebo (used as a source of iodine in thyrotoxic crisis and in the preparation of thyrotoxic patients for thyroidectomy.) in the identified trials, but because serious adverse events (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) can be rarely fatal, in some countries prescription of quinine is severely restricted. Evidence from single trials suggests that theophylline (The amount of force generated by MUSCLE CONTRACTION.) combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone, and the effects of xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius (well differentiated.) are not significantly different to quinine across all outcomes. Low or moderate quality evidence shows no significant difference between quinine and vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) or quinine and quinine-vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) mixture. Further research into these alternatives, as well other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, is thus warranted. There is no evidence to judge optimal dosage or duration of quinine treatment. Further studies using different dosages and measurement of serum quinine levels will allow a therapeutic range to be defined for muscle cramp (An increased sensation of pain or discomfort produced by mimimally noxious stimuli due to damage to soft tissue containing NOCICEPTORS or injury to a peripheral nerve.). Because serious adverse events (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) are not common, large population studies are required to more accurately inform incidence. Longer lengths of follow-up in future trials will help determine the duration of action following cessation of quinine as well as long-term adverse events (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.). The search for new therapies (conducted, recorded, and reported in accordance with the protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs), good clinical practice (GCP), and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).), pharmacological and nonpharmacological, should continue and further trials should compare vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure), quinine-vitamin E (Procedure to increase the size, shape, or volume of a body structure) combination, and quinine-theophylline (The amount of force generated by MUSCLE CONTRACTION.) mixture with quinine.",

However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death.

There is evidence from one trial that theophylline combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone.

In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps (A condition superior to an earlier condition.) the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed.

The four studies in older adults (a total of 322 participants including controls in cross-over studies) collectively suggest that magnesium is unlikely to provide a meaningful benefit in reducing the frequency or severity of cramps in that population. We consider this evidence to be of moderate quality. In contrast, the three studies in pregnant women (202 participants) are collectively inconclusive since one study found benefit in reducing both cramp frequency and cramp pain while the other two found no benefit. More research on magnesium in pregnant women is needed; however, older adult cramp sufferers appear unlikely to benefit from this therapy.

The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. The study was evaluator-blinded, but personnel and participants could not be blinded to the intervention (One who instructs or educates others.), which placed the results at a high risk of bias. Participants performed strength training (Abnormal passage communicating with the PANCREAS.) as prescribed, but 50% of the participants did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen. The trial used change in walking distance on the six-minute walk test as a measure of function; a minimal detectable change is 24.0 m. The change from baseline to six months' follow-up in the training group (9.4 m) was not detectably different from the change in the usual care group (-0.14 m) (mean difference (MD) 9.54 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -83.04 to 102.12; N = 12). Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity, assessed by the change from baseline to six months' follow-up in peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) was similar in the training group (-0.12 mL/kg/min) and the usual care group (-1.34 mL/kg/min) (MD 1.22 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -2.16 to 4.6; N = 12). A clinically meaningful increase in VO2max is 3.5 mL/kg/min. The trial assessed function on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE), which has a range of possible scores from 0 to 66, with an increase of 3 or more points indicating clinically meaningful improvement. The HFMSE score in the training group increased by 2 points from baseline to six months' follow-up, with no change in the usual care group (MD 2.00, 95% CI -2.06 to 6.06; N = 12). The training group showed a slight improvement in muscle strength, expressed as the manual muscle testing (MMT) total score, which ranges from 28 (weakest) to 280 (strongest). The change from baseline in MMT total score was 6.8 in the training group compared to -5.14 in the usual care group (MD 11.94, 95% CI -3.44 to 27.32; N = 12). The trial stated that training had no statistically significant effects on fatigue (Metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent acute arthritis, hyperuricemia and deposition of sodium urate in and around the joints, sometimes with formation of URIC ACID calculi.) and quality of life.

It is uncertain whether combined strength and aerobic exercise training is beneficial or harmful in people with SMA (Located or occurring outside the liver.) type 3, as the quality of evidence is very low. We need well-designed and adequately powered studies using protocols that meet international standards for the development of training intervention (One who instructs or educates others.)s, in order to improve our understanding of the exercise response in people with SMA (Located or occurring outside the liver.) type 3 and eventually develop exercise guidelines for this condition.",

Subgroup analyses revealed no clear subgroup effects for longer-term outcomes (four or more months) for assessment only versus alternative intervention controls; for university/college vs other settings; or for higher risk vs all/low risk participants. None of the studies (A crystalloid solution that contains 9.0g of SODIUM CHLORIDE per liter of water.) reported harms (Thickening and loss of elasticity of the CORONARY ARTERIES, leading to progressive arterial insufficiency (CORONARY DISEASE).) related to MI.

Seventy of these trials focused on higher risk individuals or settings. We were mainly interested in trials with a follow-up period of 4 or more months, and the typical follow-up period was 12 months. We also evaluated the quality of the studies' designs and their applicability to our research, finding that these studies provided moderate to low quality evidence. In 66 trials, the MI consisted of a single, individual session. In 12 studies, young people attended multiple individual sessions or mixtures of both individual sessions and group sessions. Six trials used group MI sessions only. The length of MI sessions varied, but in 57 studies it was one hour or less. The shortest MI intervention was 10 to 15 minutes, and the longest had five dedicated MI sessions over a 19-hour period. Settings for the trials varied: 58 of the 84 studies took place in college (mainly university but also four vocational) settings. The remaining trials took place in healthcare locations, a youth centre, local companies, a job-related training centre, an army recruitment setting, UK drug agencies and youth prisons. The total number of young adults was 22,872, aged on average from 15 to 24 years old. The proportion of males in the trials with both males and females ranged from 22% to 90%. The ethnicity of the young adults was typically mixed, but 52 of the 67 studies that reported ethnicity involved mostly white people. At four or more months follow-up, we found only small or borderline effects showing that MI reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed, frequency of alcohol consumption, alcohol problems and peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC). We didn't find any effects for binge drinking, average BAC, drink-driving or other alcohol-related risky behaviour. We found no relationship between the length of MI and its effectiveness. Also, there were no clear subgroup differences in effects when we examined the type of comparison group (assessment only control or alternative intervention, the setting (college/university vs other settings), or risk status (higher risk students vs all/low-risk students). None of the studies reported harms related to MI. Although we found some significant effects for MI, our reading of these results is that the strength of the effects was slight and therefore unlikely to confer any advantage in practice. Overall, there is only low or moderate quality evidence for the effects found in this review. Many of the studies did not adequately describe how young people were allocated to the study groups or how they concealed the group allocation to participants and personnel. Study drop-outs were also an issue in many studies. These problems with study quality could result in inflated estimates of MI effects, so we cannot rule out the possibility that any slight effects observed in this review are overstated. The US National Institutes of Health provided funding for half (42/84) of the studies included in this review. Twenty-nine studies provided no information about funding, and only eight papers had a clear conflict of interest statement."

All participants had asthma (Compounds that specifically inhibit PHOSPHODIESTERASE 5.), and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition biases and at high risk for biases associated with blinding. We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect. We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD (Agents used to enhance the color or contrast of target materials or samples.), computer app or game) and technique feedback devices. Differences between intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.)s, populations and outcome measures limited quantitative analyses, particularly for exacerbations, adverse events (Denotes a person of European, Middle Eastern, or North African ancestral origins whose family settled in a North American country such as the United States of America or Canada.), unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider and absenteeism from work or school. Enhanced inhaler technique education and multi-media training improved technique in most studies immediately after the intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.) and at follow-up, although the variety of checklists used meant that this was difficult to assess reliably. For both adults and children, how and when inhaler technique was assessed appeared to affect whether inhaler technique improved and by how much. Analyses of the numbers of people who demonstrated correct or 'good enough' technique were generally more useful than checklist scores. Adult studies of enhanced education showed benefit when this metric (The portion of the mitral valve annulus that attaches to the posterior mitral valve leaflet.) was used at 2 to 26 weeks' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 13.65; 258 participants; three studies; 31 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 69 (95% CI 45 to 86) in the education group; moderate-quality evidence). A similar result was seen in studies looking at feedback devices at four weeks' follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.87 to 12.33; 97 participants; one study; 51 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 83 (95% CI 66 to 93) in the feedback group; low-quality evidence). However, the benefit of multi-media training for adults even immediately after the intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.) was uncertain (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 5.50; 164 participants; two studies; I\u00b2 = 49%; 30 per 100 in the control group with correct technique compared with 47 (95% CI 26 to 70) in the multi-media group; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence tended to be less clear for children, usually because results were based on fewer and smaller studies. Some studies did not report exacerbations in a way that allowed meta-analysis; others provided inconclusive results. Inhaler technique intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.)s provided some benefit for asthma (Compounds that specifically inhibit PHOSPHODIESTERASE 5.) control and quality of life but generally did not lead to consistent or important clinical benefits for adults or children. Confidence intervals included no difference or did not reach a threshold that could be considered clinically important. Responder analyses sometimes showed improvement among more people in the intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.) groups, even though the mean difference between groups was small. We found no evidence about harms (Methods used to remove unwanted facial and body hair.). Although intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.)s to improve inhaler technique may work in some circumstances, the variety of intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.)s and measurement methods used hampered our ability to perform meta-analyses and led to low to moderate confidence in our findings. Most included studies did not report important improvement in clinical outcomes. Guidelines consistently recommend that clinicians check regularly the inhaler technique of their patients; what is not clear is how clinicians can most effectively intervene if they find a patient's technique to be inadequate, and whether such intervention (A METHYLXANTHINE derivative that inhibits phosphodiesterase and affects blood rheology.)s will have a discernible impact on clinical outcomes.",

                "We found 29 studies involving 2210 people with asthma. Studies lasted between 2 and 26 weeks. Studies reported inhaler technique on a range of different checklists. We grouped studies into three types: studies testing enhanced face-to-face training session(s), studies using multi-media to deliver inhaler training (e.g. a video, computer app or game) and studies testing devices that give people visual or audio feedback about technique. Studies tested different types of training and used different measures to gauge success, meaning that we could not bring data together. This was particularly true when we tried to assess effects on asthma attacks, adverse events, visits to a healthcare provider and absences from work or school. Both face-to-face and multi-media inhaler training improved inhaler technique in most studies, although results varied depending on how and when each technique was assessed. Some studies reported the number of people who had correct or 'good enough' technique. More people had correct or 'good enough' technique after face-to-face training and with feedback devices. But the benefit of multi-media training for adults was uncertain. Interventions that provide inhaler training may bring some benefit for quality of life and asthma control among adults and children, but results were varied and studies were small. Children may receive some benefit but results tended to be less clear for children because fewer and smaller studies have included children as participants. For studies like these, it is not possible to blind people to their assigned group. This may bias how people behave or respond to questionnaires, which reduced our confidence in the findings. We were uncertain about other results because studies did not provide enough data to show clear benefit. We cannot say for sure what is the best way to help people learn how to use their inhaler properly. It is important that patients understand how their inhaler works, so they should ask their doctor or nurse for help. We also use Cochrane Reviews to make suggestions for future research. We suggest that trials should last longer than six months and should report adherence information. The most useful information reported was the number of people who had 'good enough' inhaler technique, so we urge future trials to report this as well."

One study compared a fish oil extract (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 400 mg per day)), to placebo (pretend medicine); the second study compared vitamin A (15000 IU per day) to vitamin E (400 IU per day) and to very low levels of vitamins (vitamin A trace + vitamin E trace); and the third study compared DHA (1200 mg per day) + vitamin A (15000 IU per day) to vitamin A alone (15000 IU per day). The evidence is current to August 2013. All these studies measured the following outcomes: worsening in visual field, worsening in visual acuity (sharpness), and worsening in electroretinography results. Generally, comparison of participants who received vitamin A with or without fish oils (DHA) with participants who received placebo, did not show any difference for these outcomes, which means that the use of high-dose vitamin A or fish oils does not significantly slow progressive visual loss in people with RP. None of the studies reported any systemic adverse events from vitamin A or fish oil. However, the long-term adverse effects of high-dose vitamin A and fish oil are not known. The trials appear to have been well designed and well conducted, so we determined the quality was good for all included studies."

The majority of participants had IA, most with RA and to a lesser degree AS (Recording of the changes in electric potential of muscle by means of surface or needle electrodes.). The interventions aimed to prevent (possible or imminent.) job loss and improve work functioning in several ways: firstly by evaluating work changes or adaptations and secondly by providing any person-directed interventions including vocational counselling, advice or education. Interventions directly targeted at the work environment were minimal and included workplace visits (one trial) or any actions by an occupational physician (one trial). The duration or dose of the interventions varied from two 1.5-hour sessions (one RCT) over five months, two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months (one RCT), to six to eight individual or group sessions over six months (also one RCT). All participants were recruited through rheumatology clinics, both in or outside hospitals. Included trials investigated job loss (n = two RCTs; 382 participants), work absenteeism and work functioning (n = one RCT; 32 participants). Overall, we evaluated the two smaller trials as having a high risk of bias and the large trial as having a low risk of bias. Trials showed marked differences in how they performed on risk of bias items, particularly on performance bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach and judged there to be very low quality evidence across the three reported outcomes. Of the two RCTs investigating job loss, the larger one (n = 242 participants) reported a large statistically significant reduction in job loss (relative risk (RR) = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.68) and the other RCT (n = 140) reported similar effects in both groups, although the CI was very wide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.06). The latter one probably suffered from performance bias and we judged it to have a high risk of bias. The one small trial investigating sickness absenteeism found uncertain results at six months' follow-up (MD = -2.42 days, 95% CI -5.03 to 0.19). Finally, in the same small trial investigating work functioning using the Rheumatoid Arthritis-Work Instability Scale (RA-WIS), there was a moderate improvement of intermediate term work functioning (six months; scale range 0 to 23; mean improvement -4.67 points, 95% CI -8.43 to -0.91). We identified no adverse effects in the publications of the three trials. This Cochrane review of three RCTs found very low quality evidence overall for job loss prevent (possible or imminent.)ion interventions having an effect on job loss, work absenteeism and work functioning in workers with inflammatory arthritis. While this review highlights that further high quality RCTs are required, the results suggest that these strategies have potential to be effective.",

These trials first evaluated how the work environment could be adapted and then provided counselling, advice or education for work problems. One trial gave two 1.5-hour sessions over five months. Another trial gave two consultation and multidisciplinary treatments during three months. The third trial gave six to eight individual or group sessions over six months. The included trials compared the effects of interventions to usual care (two trials) or to written information only (one trial). Two of the included trials measured the effect of the intervention on job loss (382 participants) when the third measured effect on work absenteeism and work functioning (32 participants). When considered together, the evidence from the three trials was of very low quality. Two trials found different results on job loss measured at two years' follow-up: one trial on job counselling found a large reduction in people who lost their job and the other trial found similar effects in both groups. Another trial did not find a considerable effect on absenteeism at six months' follow-up but found a moderate improvement in work functioning. Because of positive results from one RCT with long term follow-up, we see potential for job loss prevention interventions in helping workers with inflammatory arthritis to stay at work. The certainty of these results is limited by the very low quality evidence of the three RCTs overall."

Six infants had to be treated, for one to benefit from treatment. Researchers reported no significant side effects directly attributable to too much arginine in the first 28 days, and one study reported no long-term (36 months) developmental delays. Possible effects of supplementing arginine include lower blood pressure and changes in blood glucose control. Arginine supplementation may reduce the incidence and severity of NEC in preterm infants.

Studies with high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy of 5-mg and 10-mg warfarin nomograms are needed. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was moderate for therapeutic INR and major bleeding, low for recurrent VTE and length of hospital stay, and very low for minor bleeding. The main reason for downgrading the quality of the evidence was differences between the studies in types of study participants and length of follow-up."

Two trials compared an enhanced care model provided in inpatient settings and at home after discharge with conventional care. Two trials compared geriatrician-led care in-hospital to conventional care led by the orthopaedic team. None of the interventions were designed specifically for people with dementia (The performance of the basic activities of self care, such as dressing, ambulation, or eating.), therefore the data included in the review were from subgroups of people with dementia (The performance of the basic activities of self care, such as dressing, ambulation, or eating.) or cognitive impairment (Educational institutions.) participating in randomised controlled trials investigating models of care for all older people following hip fracture. The end of follow-up in the trials ranged from the point of acute hospital discharge to 24 months after discharge. We considered all trials to be at high risk of bias in more than one domain. As subgroups of larger trials, the analyses lacked power to detect differences between the intervention groups. Furthermore, there were some important differences in baseline characteristics of participants between the experimental and control groups. Using the GRADE approach, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to low or very low. The effect estimates for almost all comparisons were very imprecise, and the overall certainty for most results was very low. There were no data from any study for our primary outcome of health-related quality of life. There was only very low certainty for our other primary outcome, activities of daily living and functional performance, therefore we were unable to draw any conclusions with confidence. There was low-certainty that enhanced care and rehabilitation in-hospital may reduce rates of postoperative delirium (The act of alteration or modification; changed or altered in form or character.) (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.22, 2 trials, n = 141) and very low-certainty associating it with lower rates of some other complications. There was also low-certainty that, compared to orthopaedic-led management, geriatrician-led management may lead to shorter hospital stays (mean difference 4.00 days, 95% CI 3.61 to 4.39, 1 trial, n = 162). We found limited evidence that some of the models of enhanced rehabilitation and care used in the included trials may show benefits over usual care for preventing delirium and reducing length of stay for people with dementia (The performance of the basic activities of self care, such as dressing, ambulation, or eating.) who have been treated for hip fracture. However, the certainty of these results is low. Data were available from only a small number of trials, and the certainty for all other results is very low.

The latest search was performed on 16 October 2019. We identified seven trials that studied a total of 555 people with dementia following hip fracture. Five trials compared an enhanced interdisciplinary rehabilitation and care programme where the various healthcare professionals worked collaboratively across hospital and community settings or just in hospital, to usual hospital care. Two trials compared care in-hospital led by a geriatrician versus care led by an orthopaedic surgeon. People with dementia who receive enhanced care and rehabilitation in hospital after a hip fracture may be less likely to develop delirium. When care is led by a geriatrician, they may have stays in hospital that are three to four days shorter than if care is led by an orthopaedic surgeon. There was no information on the effect of any of the care models on quality of life, and we could not be certain about their effects on other important outcomes such as an individual's ability to manage their daily activities, regaining mobility, cognitive function, pain, death rates, or the likelihood of the person returning to the same place they had been living before the fracture. The main issues with the evidence were that most of the studies were small and their results may have been subject to bias. Most of the results of the review are very uncertain. None of the care models had been designed specifically for people with dementia. All of the data included in the review came from people with dementia who had been included in larger trials for all older people with hip fractures, although people with dementia may have particular needs. There may be some benefits from the care models studied, but the currently available research is insufficient to determine the best ways to care for people with dementia after a hip fracture operation."

It is an update of our original review published in 2006. We found seven relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of total of 840 children aged from birth to 18 years with acute and/or chronic illnesses receiving either specialist home-based nursing services or conventional health care. The outcomes included use of health care services, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. We decided not to combine the results of these RCTs because of the variety in types of services provided, types of participants and the outcome measures used. The results of individual RCTs show improved satisfaction with home-based care with no adverse impact on physical health outcomes for children. There is some evidence that specialist home-based nursing services reduce the length of hospital stay; however, there is no evidence that it leads to a reduction in use of hospital services.

(n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies (A long-lasting, recombinant version of human insulin.). The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. The majority of studies (A long-lasting, recombinant version of human insulin.) had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies (A long-lasting, recombinant version of human insulin.) provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. 1. ICM versus standard care When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34,low-quality evidence). Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79, low-quality evidence). For the outcome adverse events (Wave-like oscillations of electric potential between parts of the brain recorded by EEG.), the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51, low-quality evidence). In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low-quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0, very low-quality evidence). 2. ICM versus non-ICM When ICM was compared with non-ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate-quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.21, moderate-quality evidence) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.05, moderate-quality evidence) compared to non-ICM. Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention (Widely spread; not localized or confined.) early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95,low-quality evidence) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84, low-quality evidence). Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non-ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74, very low-quality evidence). 3. Fidelity to ACT Within the meta-regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient -0.36, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline (Preliminary cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone/endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, hyperthermia, etc.)) hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline (Preliminary cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone/endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, hyperthermia, etc.)) hospital use' variable coefficient -0.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10). Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline (Preliminary cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone/endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, hyperthermia, etc.)) hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07, P = 0.0027). Based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness (the vascular structure that nourishes the crystalline lens in utero.). Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care. It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illness (the vascular structure that nourishes the crystalline lens in utero.)es (Description:Represents the HL7 V3 publishing sub-section that holds specifications related to the management of practice settings within the Administrative Management (AM) section.UsageNote:V3 Specifications are published in a set of \"domains\", which contain interactions and related specifications for a single area of health care within which can be supported by a single, coherent set of interoperability specifications.For publishing purposes, these domains are aggregated into sub-sections of related health care areas and these sub-sections are further aggregated into three major sets.) in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years). Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT model were more effective at reducing time in hospital. However, it is unclear what overall gain ICM provides on top of a less formal non-ICM approach. We do not think that more trials comparing current ICM with standard care or non-ICM are justified, however we currently know of no review comparing non-ICM with standard care, and this should be undertaken.",

The trials took place in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and the USA. When ICM was compared to standard care, those in the ICM group were more likely to stay with the service, have improved general functioning, get a job, not be homeless, and have shorter stays in hospital (especially when they had had very long stays in hospital previously).\u00a0When ICM was compared to non-ICM, the only clear difference was that those in the ICM group were more likely to be kept in care.

All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. Box model training versus no training: The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task (A hydroxylated metabolite of ESTRADIOL or ESTRONE that has a hydroxyl group at C3, 16-alpha, and 17-beta position.) completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22). Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88).

There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction. Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task (A hydroxylated metabolite of ESTRADIOL or ESTRONE that has a hydroxyl group at C3, 16-alpha, and 17-beta position.) when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65).

There were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons (box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; single incision versus multiport box model training; Z-maze box training versus U-maze box training). The only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with Z-maze box training than U-maze box training (1 trial; 16 participants; SMD 1.55; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.71). One trial (36 participants) found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer (SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56). Another trial (22 participants) found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training (SMD 1.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.84). There were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons. None of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials. The results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience. The impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown. There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary.

We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation. Evidence was moderate-to-low quality."

The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments (The duration of a surgical procedure in hours and minutes.) in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.), which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (Process by which organic tissue becomes hardened by the physiologic deposit of calcium salts.) (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events (The act of being present (at a meeting or event etc.)) showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders (Joined in some kind of relationship.). The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments (The duration of a surgical procedure in hours and minutes.), high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) and placebo, but between benzodiazepines (The period of confinement of a patient to a hospital or other health facility.) and other agents (The linear extent in space from one end of something to the other end, or the extent of something from beginning to end.), notably SSRIs (Following the fourth position in an ordering or series; coming next after the fourth and just before the sixth in position.), both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms (exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs.) from treatment in a long-term perspective.",

                "We found consistent evidence for a possible advantage of benzodiazepines in the improvement of panic symptoms and in the number of participants dropping out of treatment. Furthermore, benzodiazepines may improve social functioning more than placebo. However, there may be more dropouts due to side effects and more participants who experience at least one side effect when treated with benzodiazepines. We found several severe limitations in the design of the included studies. For example, it seems that at least in some studies participants and physicians were able to guess to which treatment arm the participants were allocated, thus it is possible that some trials were not really blinded. These limitations may have led to an overestimation of the treatment effect. Another major limitation is that our included studies were only short-term studies and did not reflect the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, it is unclear if the effect is maintained after the end of treatment. High-quality long-term studies should be carried out to establish whether the benefits of treatment can be maintained and to put the benefits in context of withdrawal effects and the risk of dependency. However, it is unlikely that the general conclusions regarding the short-term efficacy and the dependency potential of benzodiazepines will change. Comparisons with other active treatment including psychotherapy, for example in multiple-treatment meta-analyses, may thus be more suitable to inform clinical practise."

Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver (Cannot add RN: EC 3.6.1.-) and kidney (Greatest in amount, extent, or degree; constituting a majority.) yin deficiency syndrome. No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality or non-fatal events as most studies were short term (all studies had follow-up of one year or less). There was also considerable heterogeneity between studies, which meant that it was not possible to combine studies statistically for cardiovascular risk (I2 statistic for systolic blood pressure (SBP (The act of alteration or modification; changed or altered in form or character.)) was 96%, for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 96%, for total cholesterol 96%, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 95%, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C (Sharp instruments used for puncturing or suturing.)) 98%, triglyceride (A measure of the mortality and morbidity rates among patients who receive CRITICAL CARE and INTENSIVE CARE as determined from the date of hospital discharge or release.)s 75%).

A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs (A syndrome with excessively high INSULIN levels in the BLOOD.). Three trials reported lipid levels and two found reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride (A measure of the mortality and morbidity rates among patients who receive CRITICAL CARE and INTENSIVE CARE as determined from the date of hospital discharge or release.)s (total cholesterol reductions ranged from -1.30 mmol/L (95% CI -1.57 to -1.03) to -0.50 mmol/L (95% CI -0.74 to -0.26): LDL-C reductions ranged from -0.76 mmol/L (95% CI -0.93 to -0.59) to -0.59 mmol/L (95% CI -0.80 to -0.38): triglyceride (A measure of the mortality and morbidity rates among patients who receive CRITICAL CARE and INTENSIVE CARE as determined from the date of hospital discharge or release.) reductions ranged from -0.46 mmol/L (95% CI -0.62 to -0.30) to -0.37 mmol/L (95% CI -0.67 to-0.07)) and increased HDL-C (Sharp instruments used for puncturing or suturing.) with the intervention (Capacity of the ovary to provide viable eggs.)

There are currently no long-term trials examining tai chi for the primary prevention (Profuse lacrimation.) of CVD. Due to the limited evidence available currently no conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of tai chi on CVD risk factors.

We found 13 trials, none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of tai chi on reducing cardiovascular deaths or non-fatal endpoints. There were variations in the duration and style of tai chi and the follow-up of the interventions ranged from three to 12 months. Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies. None of the included studies reported on adverse events. Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.

            "input": "Twenty-seven RCTs were included. The interventions were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention, the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco (Extending relatively far inward.), the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. Two interventions were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct interventions were tested only by one RCT. Twenty-three interventions were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India. The control conditions (placed in some person or thing; conviction of the truth of some statement or the reality of some phenomenon.) fell into two main groups: no intervention or usual care; or school-based interventions provided to all participants. These two groups of studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) were considered separately. Most studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. Although there was heterogeneity between studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results. We were unable to extract data from all studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis. There was moderate quality evidence family-based interventions had a positive impact on preventing (Agents that are capable of inducing a total or partial loss of sensation, especially tactile sensation and pain.) smoking when compared to a no intervention control. Nine studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data. The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention arms (The number of occurrences of something within a given time period.) (risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.84). Most of these studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) used intensive interventions. Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide. Two studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17). Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention only. Of the three studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). The other five studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis. One RCT also compared a family intervention to a school 'good behaviour' intervention and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388). No studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) identified any adverse effects of intervention. There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based interventions can have a positive effect on preventing (Agents that are capable of inducing a total or partial loss of sensation, especially tactile sensation and pain.) children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There were more studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.) of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention, than there were for other compairsons. The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school interventions. Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old. Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies (Inflammation of the BRONCHIOLES.). Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting.",

                "We identified 27 trials; 23 in the USA and one each in Australia, India, the Netherlands, and Norway. The focus varied amongst the studies. Fifteen trials focused on substance use prevention: six focused only on tobacco prevention; one focused on alcohol; one on general substance abuse; three on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana; two on alcohol and tobacco; and two on tobacco and cardiovascular health. Two trials focused on HIV and unsafe sex prevention. Ten trials focused on family functioning, child development and modifying adolescent behaviour. Duration of follow-up after the intervention was very varied, ranging from 6 months to over 15 years for the studies which intervened with mothers of very young children. Nine trials provided data to compare a family tobacco intervention to no intervention on future smoking behaviour for those who did not smoke at the start of the study. We could not include data from a further eight trials. The results showed a significant benefit of family-based interventions over the control comparison on preventing experimentation with or taking up regular smoking. Our estimate suggested that family interventions could reduce the number of adolescents who tried smoking at all by between 16 and 32%. Two trials provided data to compare a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention and also favoured the family-based intervention. The estimate suggested that the addition of a family intervention might reduce the onset of smoking by between 4 and 25%. We could not include data from a further five trials. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting. Because most of the randomised controlled trials included in the review did not report their methods in sufficient detail to be confident that the results were not biased, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate, which means that the estimate of effect is uncertain. There is moderate quality evidence that family-based interventions can prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke. Intensive programs may be more likely to be successful than those of lower intensity. There is also evidence to suggest that adding a family-based component to a school intervention may be effective. As the interventions and settings in the review differed considerably, it is important that family-based programmes continue to be evaluated."

Of three studies that included children with HIV, one was funded by an International Aid Agency, another by government and the third by a charity. Of four studies that included children with cystic fibrosis, three were funded by charities and one by government. The one study that included children with sickle cell disease was funded by government and the study that included children with cancer was funded by government, industry and charity. The funding source for the study that included newborns with underlying respiratory disorders was not specified. In children with HIV, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of contracting tuberculosis. Overall there was no improvement in death rates, but there was a marked reduction in hospital admission with antibiotic use in one study. In children with cystic fibrosis, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of infection with Pseudomonas bacteria, but there was a reduction in flare-ups, where bacterial infection makes it harder for the child to breathe. In one study of children with sickle cell disease, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting blood infections. In one study of children with cancers, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting Pneumocystis infection in the lungs. In low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of lung infections. In children with HIV, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics for preventing tuberculosis as moderate because of differences in how the antibiotics were administered. We rated the quality of the evidence for antibiotic use in reducing deaths as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for hospital admissions. In children with cystic fibrosis, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pseudomonas infection as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. We rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing 'flare-ups' as high. In children with cancer, we rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pneumocystis infection as moderate because of the likelihood of indirectness of the study results. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of blood infections in children with sickle cell disease, or in reducing the likelihood of lung infections in low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders; the two studies had low probability and high probability of bias respectively."

We identified nine clinical trials with 519 participants, of which three trials (196 participants) compared nitrous oxide (laughing gas) with carbon dioxide, five trials (177 participants) compared helium with carbon dioxide, and one trial (146 participants) compared room air with carbon dioxide. Studies were conducted in the USA, Australia, China, Finland, and Netherlands. The age of the participants in the trials ranged from 19 to 62 years. We are uncertain as to whether there are differences in the number of people with heart or lung complications or surgical complications between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. We are uncertain as to whether there are any differences in heart or lung complications, surgical complications, or pain scores between helium and carbon dioxide. There were no serious side effects related to the use of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, or room air, but generally serious side effects are rare events and it would take larger studies with many more participants to be sure that these gases are equally safe. There were three serious side effects when helium was used. Room air seemed to be associated with lower total hospital costs compared with carbon dioxide for insufflation of the abdominal cavity. Because of the few participants included in the review, the safety of using nitrous oxide, helium, or room air is unknown. There is no evidence for any clinical improvement by using nitrous oxide, helium, or room air instead of carbon dioxide. Overall, the quality of the evidence for the results is very low. Thus, future well-designed trials examining complications, harms, quality of life, and pain are urgently needed."

Despite the fact that some studies reported a modulating effect of treatment regimens (The determination of the amount of insulin-like growth factor-1 present in a sample.) in favor of higher-dosage regimens on the incidence of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment (Healthcare administered to an individual in the individual's residence.), recommendations on the optimal type of corticosteroid, the optimal dosage, or the optimal timing of initiation for the prevention (A group with aims to conduct, develop, coordinate, and stimulate laboratory and clinical research in Europe to improve the management of cancer and related problems by increasing survival but also patients' quality of life.) of BPD in preterm infants cannot be made based on current level of evidence.

Those studies comparing a high versus a lower-dosage regimen showed an increased risk of BPD and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome for infants receiving a lower cumulative dose. Those studies investigating an early versus later administration of steroids did not show any difference in outcome. Furthermore, pulse regimens showed inferior results for the outcome BPD compared with continuous treatment. An individualized dosage regimen showed no differences compared to the standard tapering course.

Investigators in five studies (below the normal range.) did not report adverse events. The three studies (below the normal range.) reporting on adverse events reported substantial adverse events. However, all results should be interpreted with caution because of the age of the studies (below the normal range.) and the substantial risk of bias. Little evidence of benefit was found when corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulins were used to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions (Nitrogen oxide (N2O).) in patients with acute rheumatic fever. The antiquity of most of the trials restricted adequate statistical analysis of the data and acceptable assessment of clinical outcomes by current standards. In addition, risk of bias was substantial, so results should be viewed with caution. New randomised controlled trials in patients with acute rheumatic fever are warranted to assess the effects of corticosteroids such as oral prednisone (converted to PYRIDOXAL PHOSPHATE which a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, aminolevulinic acid.)

At follow-up, 1-7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. Physical functioning, depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms were also more reduced when compared with other psychological therapies. However at follow-up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Very few studies reported on the acceptability of CBT and no studies examined side effects. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches."

The included study had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data (high dropout rate in the placebo (Cessation of air flow due to abnormal central nervous system control.) group), but a low risk of bias for other domains such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. Compared to the placebo (Cessation of air flow due to abnormal central nervous system control.) group, the vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) group had significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( (The study of the mechanics of a living body, especially of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on the skeletal structure.)A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) (25(OH)D) levels at eight weeks, mean difference 29.79 (95% confidence interval 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, mean difference 12.67 (95% confidence interval 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, mean difference 15.52 (95% confidence interval 13.50 to 17.54). We determined the quality of the evidence for this outcome to be moderate. There was no significant difference of adverse events (caused by some previous phenomenon.) (tingling of lips or hands (Naturally occurring or synthetic substances that inhibit or retard oxidation reactions.)) between the vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) and placebo (Cessation of air flow due to abnormal central nervous system control.) groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 72.84), but the quality of the evidence was low. Regarding the frequency of pain (Combine together into a single unit, group, or sample.), the vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) group had significantly fewer pain (Combine together into a single unit, group, or sample.) days compared to the placebo (Cessation of air flow due to abnormal central nervous system control.) group, mean difference -10.00 (95% confidence interval -16.47 to -3.53), but again the quality of the evidence was low. Furthermore, the review included physical functioning PedsQL scores which was reported as absolute change from baseline. The vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) group had a lower (worse) health-related quality of life score than the placebo (Cessation of air flow due to abnormal central nervous system control.) group but this was not significant at eight weeks, mean difference -2.02 (95% confidence interval -6.34 to 2.30). However, the difference was significant at both 16 weeks, mean difference -12.56 (95% confidence interval -16.44 to -8.69) and 24 weeks, mean difference -12.59 (95% confidence interval -17.43 to -7.76). We determined the quality of evidence for this outcome to be low. We included only one low-quality clinical study which had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data. Therefore, we consider that the evidence is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) supplementation (A ticlopidine analog and platelet purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist that inhibits adenosine diphosphate-mediated PLATELET AGGREGATION.) (e.g. the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines) and dietary reference intakes for calcium (A pathologic condition that results from a disease, treatment, or injury.) and vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) (e.g. from the USA Institute of Medicine). Evidence of vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) supplementation (A ticlopidine analog and platelet purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist that inhibits adenosine diphosphate-mediated PLATELET AGGREGATION.) in sickle cell disease (used in the treatment of HERPES ZOSTER and HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTION of the skin and mucous membranes, including GENITAL HERPES.) from high quality studies is needed. Well-designed, randomised, placebo (Cessation of air flow due to abnormal central nervous system control.)-controlled studies of parallel design, are required to determine the effects and the safety of vitamin D (A storage reservoir for BILE secretion.) supplementation (A ticlopidine analog and platelet purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist that inhibits adenosine diphosphate-mediated PLATELET AGGREGATION.) in children and adults with sickle cell disease (used in the treatment of HERPES ZOSTER and HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTION of the skin and mucous membranes, including GENITAL HERPES.).",

                "The review included one study which recruited 46 people with sickle cell disease aged between seven and 21 years; of these 39 people in the study were randomly selected to take vitamin D tablets or placebo tablets for six weeks and then followed up for six months. The study reported results from 37 people. People taking a vitamin D supplement had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood when it was measured after eight, 16 and 24 weeks. There were no differences in the number of people reporting side effects, such as tingling in the lips or hands between the vitamin D group and the placebo group. The vitamin D group had fewer days of pain compared to the placebo group. The study also reported on health-related quality of life (physical functioning scores). After eight weeks the vitamin D group had a slightly worse score than the placebo group, but the difference was much greater after 16 and 24 weeks. Given these results from this small single study with moderate to low quality of the evidence, we do not think the results of our review are of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation (e.g. the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines), and recommendations for calcium and vitamin D intake (from e.g. the USA Institute of Medicine). High-quality studies looking at the effects of supplementing vitamin D in children and adults with sickle cell disease are needed. We do not think there are risks of bias in the way people were put into the different groups and we do not think anyone (either the participant or the doctor) could guess which group they were in once the study started. Even though the adverse events were not reported in the original report, the study author provided the information upon request. More people dropped out of the placebo group (68.4%) than the vitamin D group (5%), and two people assigned to vitamin D group but not included in the analysis. We considered there was a high risk of bias in the way the study reported results. The evidence is only applicable to people with sickle cell disease when they are in a steady state, i.e. at least 30 days from blood transfusion and at least 14 days from any acute sickle complication. The quality of evidence for the outcomes ranged from moderate to low. We considered the quality of the evidence for vitamin D blood levels to be moderate, and for adverse events, days of pain and health-related quality of life, the quality of the evidence was low."

This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause, and compared two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). Children were allocated randomly to one of the two treatments. Treatments were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia. Speech pathology students delivered the treatments in the English language. Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy. Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only. A number of cases in each cohort had recommenced usual treatment by their speech and language pathologist between one month and four months post-treatment (clinically significant based on judgment.) (NDP-3: 9/13 participants; ReST: 9/13 participants). Hence, maintenance of treatment effects to four months post-treatment (clinically significant based on judgment.) could not be analysed without significant potential bias, and thus this time point was not included for further analysis (Headwear designed to protect against injuries) in this review. We judged all core outcome domains to be low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified. Both the NDP-3 and ReST therapies (Annotation used to indicate the size or magnitude of something that was determined by comparison to a standard.) demonstrated improvement at one month post-treatment (clinically significant based on judgment.). For three outcomes the effect was marginally greater for NDP-3 than ReST: accuracy of production on treated words (used in the treatment of RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS; ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS; PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS and CROHN'S DISEASE.)

ReST (MD = 18.3) demonstrated a marginally greater effect than NDP-3 (MD = 18.2) for accuracy of production on non-treated words (used in the treatment of RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS; ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS; PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS and CROHN'S DISEASE.) at one month post-treatment (clinically significant based on judgment.) (absolute MD = 0.1 between groups). The study did not assess the outcome of functional communication. There is limited evidence that, when delivered intensively, both NDP-3 and ReST may effect improvement in word accuracy in 4- to 12-year-old children with CAS, measured by the accuracy of production on treated and non-treated words (used in the treatment of RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS; ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS; PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS and CROHN'S DISEASE.), speech production (Products of non-enzymatic reactions between GLUCOSE and HEMOGLOBIN A, occurring as a minor fraction of the hemoglobin components of human erythrocytes.) consistency and the accuracy of connected speech. The study did not measure functional communication. No formal analyses were conducted to compare NDP-3 and ReST by the original study authors, hence one treatment cannot be reliably advocated over the other. We are also unable to say whether either treatment is better than no treatment or treatment as usual. No evidence currently exists to support the effectiveness of other treatments for children aged 4 to 12 years with idiopathic CAS without other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (Immunoglobulin molecules having a specific amino acid sequence by virtue of which they interact only with the ANTIGEN (or a very similar shape) that induced their synthesis in cells of the lymphoid series (especially PLASMA CELLS).).

One study conducted in Brazil in both adults and children compared trimethoprim-sulfamexacocol (The action of obtaining something by payment.) over 20 months to no treatment and was judged to be at high risk of performance, detection (Electromagnetic radiation in the portion of the spectrum from about 380 nm (violet) to 800 nm (red).), and attrition bias.

Only the study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Foods eaten between MEALTIMES.) over 12 months, in participants with healed lesions, reported the effect of treatment on visual acuity.

The UK study of pyrimethamine (A rare disease caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), most commonly types 6 and 11, that affects tissue along the respiratory tract with the majority of cases affecting the larynx.) for four weeks reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in treated compared with control participants (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.19; 29 participants; low-quality evidence). The study in Brazil of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Foods eaten between MEALTIMES.) for 12 months stated that the severity of inflammation was higher in the comparator group when compared to the antibiotic (The ratio of two odds.)-treated group but did not provide further details.

Treatment with antibiotic (The ratio of two odds.)s probably reduces the risk of recurrent toxoplasma retinochoroiditis, but there is currently no good evidence that this leads to better visual outcomes. However, absence of evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect.

Three studies examined the effect of antibiotics on reducing the number of recurring episodes of the disease. Two of these three studies were conducted in Brazil in adults infected with the more aggressive South American strains of the parasite, which can cause frequently recurring eye symptoms. The studies from Brazil found that the long-term antibiotics over 14 and 12 months, respectively, reduced the number of recurrent episodes of retinochoroiditis. The other study did not find that short-term (eight weeks) treatment with antibiotics made any difference. Two studies reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in antibiotic-treated compared with untreated participants, and one study reported no changes. Two studies investigated side effects of giving antibiotics such as decreased white blood cells, loss of appetite, rashes and other allergic reactions and found only weak evidence that antibiotics increase the risk of side effects. There were problems with the design, conduct, and analyses of all of the studies, which could have biased the results.

Other trials involved newer varieties of intramedullary nails. Most older trials showed a tendency for the nails to be associated with an increased risk of fracture of the thigh bone both during and after the operation. More recent trials testing newer varieties of nails seemed to avoid this specific problem to some extent. The review found that using intramedullary nails resulted in one extra reoperation in every 50 people. Mortality and, where data were available, other long-term outcomes were similar between the implants. The review concluded that current evidence supports the continued use of the sliding hip screw for fixing the more common types of extracapsular hip fractures. This may not be the case for some of the more recently developed designs of intramedullary nails or for specific fracture types, but further research is required to confirm this."

Temozolomide increased OS (hazard ratio (HR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.79, P value 0.0003) and increased PFS (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92, P value 0.02), when compared with radiotherapy alone, although these benefits only appear to emerge when therapy is given in both concomitant and adjuvant phases (Endoscopic examination, therapy or surgery of the interior of the uterus.) of treatment. A single RCT found that temozolomide did not have a statistically significant effect on QoL (A drug combination with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.). Risk of haematological complications (Presence or formation of GALLSTONES in the BILIARY TRACT, usually in the gallbladder (CHOLECYSTOLITHIASIS) or the common bile duct (CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS).), fatigue and infections were increased with temozolomide. In recurrent HGG, two RCTs enrolling 672 patients in total found that temozolomide did not increase OS compared to standard chemotherapy (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.06, P value 0.2) but it did increase PFS in a subgroup analysis of grade IV GBM tumours (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90, P value 0.008). Adverse events were similar between arms (A system for quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis (MS).). In the elderly, 2 RCTs of 664 patients found OS and PFS was similar with temozolomide alone versus radiotherapy alone. QoL (A drug combination with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.) did not appear to differ between arms (A system for quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis (MS).) in a single trial but certain adverse events were significantly more common with temozolomide. Temozolomide when given in both concomitant and adjuvant phases (Endoscopic examination, therapy or surgery of the interior of the uterus.) is an effective primary therapy in GBM compared to radiotherapy alone. It prolongs survival and delays progression (Acute or chronic inflammation of JOINTS.) without impacting on QoL (A drug combination with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.) but it does increase early adverse events. In recurrent GBM, temozolomide compared with standard chemotherapy improves time-to-progression (Acute or chronic inflammation of JOINTS.)

The short-term adverse events associated with temozolomide are low but can be severe, while the long-term effects are unknown. No RCTs investigated the use of temozolomide in HGGs other than GBM. In recurrent GBM, temozolomide delayed progression but did not improve overall survival. In the elderly population (age over 60 years), temozolomide alone appears to be a suitable alternative to radiotherapy alone for primary therapy of GBM. Either treatment has similar overall survival, progression-free survival and quality of life, but there are possibly more adverse events with temozolomide. All these trials enrolled highly selected patients with good prognostic features that are not entirely representative of all patients with HGG limiting the general applicability of these results."

Of these 12 trials, eight trials recruited only people with fatigue and were primarily intended to treat fatigue, no trial was primarily intended to prevent fatigue and the other four trials were not primarily intended to treat or prevent fatigue but reported fatigue as an outcome. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of any intervention to treat or prevent fatigue in people with stroke. The general study quality was low.

The sample sizes of the three trials were very small with 12 (Malone 1991), 19 (Singh 2002) and 40 infants enrolled (Hu 1999). The intervention (An infection of the small intestine (enteritis) by clostridium difficile.) and the outcome assessments could not be blinded to the clinical staff in two trials (Malone 1991; Hu 1999). One study (Malone 1991), glucose and insulin, compared to cation-exchange resin (Cessation of breathing and/or cardiac function.), caused a reduction in all cause mortality that was of borderline statistical significance: RR 0.18 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.15); RD -0.66 (95% CI -1.09 to -0.22); NNTB 2 (95% CI 1 to 5)]. In the study of Hu (Hu 1999), the incidence of intraventricular haemorrhage \u2265 grade 2 was significantly reduced [RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.93); RD -0.35 (95% CI -0.62 to -0.08); NNTB 3 (95% CI 2 to 13).

No differences noted in mortality or other clinical outcomes (Singh 2002). No serious side effects were noted with either the combination of insulin and glucose or albuterol (A membrane on the vitreal surface of the retina resulting from the proliferation of one or more of three retinal elements: (1) fibrous astrocytes; (2) fibrocytes; and (3) retinal pigment epithelial cells.) inhalation. Other intervention (An infection of the small intestine (enteritis) by clostridium difficile.)s listed in our objectives have not been studied to date. In view of the limited information from small studies (Cyclical movement of a body part that can represent either a physiologic process or a manifestation of disease.) of uncertain quality, no firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

Two studies enrolling 52 infants that assessed the use of a combination of insulin and sugar to reduce the blood levels of potassium were identified. This combination reduced the duration of high blood levels of potassium and the risk for bleeds in the brains of the infants. One study that enrolled 19 patients reported on the use of albuterol (a medication that helps to move potassium from the blood to the body cells). Albuterol lowered the blood levels of potassium both at four and at eight hours after the treatment had started.

Seven trials with a variable risk of bias compared IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) with PE in 623 severely affected participants. In five trials with 536 participants for whom the outcome was available, the mean difference (MD) of change in a seven-grade disability scale after four weeks was not significantly different between the two treatments (A complex disorder characterized by infertility, HIRSUTISM; OBESITY; and various menstrual disturbances such as OLIGOMENORRHEA; AMENORRHEA; ANOVULATION.): MD of 0.02 of a grade more improvement in the intravenous immunoglobulin (Aspiration of the contents of the uterus with a vacuum curette.) than the plasma exchange group; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to -0.20. There were also no statistically significant differences in the other measures considered. Three studies (A synthetic, N-alkylated imino analogue of D-glucose.) including a total of 75 children suggested that IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) significantly hastens recovery compared with supportive care. The primary outcome for this review, available for only one trial with 21 mildly affected children, showed significantly more improvement in disability grade after four weeks with IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) than supportive treatment alone, MD 1.42, 95% CI 2.57 to 0.27. In one trial involving 249 participants comparing PE followed by IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) with PE alone, the mean grade improvement was 0.2 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.54) more in the combined treatment (Used with disease (The quality of being opaque to a degree; the degree to which something reduces the passage of light.)s for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) group than in the PE alone group; not clinically significantly different, but not excluding the possibility of significant extra benefit. Another trial with 34 participants comparing immunoabsorption followed by IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) with immunoabsorption alone did not reveal significant extra benefit from the combined treatment (Used with disease (The quality of being opaque to a degree; the degree to which something reduces the passage of light.)s for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.). Adverse events were not significantly more frequent with either treatment, but IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) is significantly much more likely to be completed than PE. One trial in altogether 51 children showed no significant difference when the standard dose was given over two days rather than five days. A previous Cochrane review has shown that PE hastens recovery compared with supportive treatment alone. There are no adequate comparisons of IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) with placebo (Persons admitted to health facilities which provide board and room, for the purpose of observation, care, diagnosis or treatment.) in adults, but this review provides moderate quality evidence that, in severe disease (The quality of being opaque to a degree; the degree to which something reduces the passage of light.), IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) started within two weeks from onset hastens recovery as much as PE. Adverse events were not significantly more frequent with either treatment but IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) is significantly much more likely to be completed than PE. Also, according to moderate quality evidence, giving IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) after PE did not confer significant extra benefit. In children, according to low quality evidence, IVIg (An antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties.) probably hastens recovery compared with supportive care alone. More research is needed in mild disease (The quality of being opaque to a degree; the degree to which something reduces the passage of light.) and in patients whose treatment starts more than two weeks after onset.

                "We included trials of IVIg compared to no treatment, dummy treatment, PE, immunoabsorption (in which specific antibodies are removed from blood) or other immune treatments. We also considered trials of IVIg added to another treatment. We found 12 trials. Some of these compared more than two treatments. - Seven trials compared IVIg with PE (in 623 participants with severe GBS). - One compared PE alone to PE followed by IVIg (in 249 participants). - Three compared IVIg with supportive care (in a total of 75 children). - One compared a two-day to a five-day IVIg treatment plan (in 51 children). - One compared IVIg with immunoabsorption (in 48 participants). - One compared IVIg plus immunoabsorption with immunoabsorption (in 34 participants). For this review, we chose change in a disability scale after four weeks\u2019 treatment as the main measure of the effect of IVIg. Five of the trials comparing IVIg and PE measured change in disability. IVIg and PE produced a similar amount of improvement in disability in the 536 trial participants. This evidence was of moderate quality. Harmful effects were no more frequent with PE or IVIg, but people were more likely to finish a course of IVIg. In one trial involving 249 participants who received PE or PE followed by IVIg, there was slightly more improvement from PE and IVIg together. The effect was probably not large enough to be noticeable but the results do not rule out the possibility. This evidence was of moderate quality. Three studies in children suggested that IVIg speeds up recovery compared with supportive care. Only one used the disability scale. They provided low quality evidence. In one small trial in children, the effect on disability appeared similar with a standard dose over two days rather than five days. Giving IVIg after immunoabsorption provided no extra benefit over immunoabsorption alone. No conclusions can be drawn from the trial comparing IVIg with immunoabsorption. The risk of bias in the included studies was variable. More research is needed to find the best dose of IVIg in adults and children, and one trial of giving a second dose to people who otherwise would be expected to do badly is in progress. The evidence is current to December 2013."

In a trial sequential analysis (Express the need or desire for; ask for.), the required information size was not reached and the analysis (Express the need or desire for; ask for.) could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) was not associated with all-cause mortality to the longest follow-up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow-up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) associated with the risk of surgical site infection (oxidized to form CYSTINE.) in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference -0.06 days, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics (Any natural or laboratory-made substance that has some or all of the biologic effects of progesterone, a female hormone.), a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) was associated with a decrease in surgical site infection (oxidized to form CYSTINE.)s (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality).

As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) of 60% or higher on surgical site infection (oxidized to form CYSTINE.), our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A subject selection method whereby subjects with similar characteristics are assigned as a pair, with the intention that each will receive different treatment within the course of the clinical trial.) during anaesthesia and surgery.

In the 23 studies many different antibiotics were used and the children were of different ages and had suffered from glue ear for various lengths of time. They looked at the benefits at various time points after the treatment was given. The most important outcomes that we measured were the difference in the proportion of children who no longer had glue ear two to three months after the treatment was started and adverse effects of antibiotics (diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash). We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have glue ear resolved two to three months after the treatment was started than those allocated to control treatment. The number of children needed to treat for one beneficial outcome (NNTB) was five. However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash than those allocated to control treatment.

In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results.

Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube (grommet) insertions (two trials, 121 children) or in adverse consequences for the tympanic membrane (ear drum) (one trial, 103 children). Low quality evidence indicated that children treated with oral antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media (ear infection) episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months after treatment was started (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5). It should however be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on ear infection episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when studies with high risk of bias were excluded. Moderate quality evidence is available that children with glue ear do benefit from oral antibiotics in terms of resolving glue ear at various time points and reducing acute otitis media episodes during follow-up compared with control treatment. Low quality evidence is available that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting and skin rash than those receiving the control treatment. Currently only two trials have assessed the impact of oral antibiotics on hearing and these showed conflicting results (low quality evidence). Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube insertions or in adverse consequences for the tympanic membrane."

However, questions concerning the level of protein (Partial or complete opacity on or in the lens or capsule of one or both eyes, impairing vision or causing blindness.) intake and compliance remain. Further longer-term research on large representative groups of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (A plant genus of the family VALERIANACEAE, order Dipsacales, subclass Asteridae, class Magnoliopsida.) is necessary. Because of the variability amongst patients, there might perhaps be a six month therapeutic trial of protein (Partial or complete opacity on or in the lens or capsule of one or both eyes, impairing vision or causing blindness.) restriction in all individuals, with continuation (Any number of entities (members) considered as a unit.) only in those who responded best.

However, individual variation existed, therefore a low-protein diet may benefit some individuals. A low-protein diet can be difficult to adhere to, especially over the long term. Reducing the amount of animal protein is the usual method but some evidence suggests that a shift from red meat to white meat and fish or vegetables may give similar results. We found no data on the effects of low-protein diet on health-related quality of life and costs."

For moderate to severe injury, 'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.), and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) early after injury results in better outcomes. For participants with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.), 'strong evidence' revealed that more intensive programmes are associated with earlier functional gains, and 'moderate evidence' suggested that continued outpatient therapy could help to sustain gains made in early post-acute rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.). The context of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) appears to influence outcomes. 'Strong evidence' supports the use of a milieu-oriented model for patients with severe brain injury, in which comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation (Medical and/or social characteristics that prevent a subject from being allowed to participate in a clinical study, as outlined in the study protocol.) (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) takes place in a therapeutic environment and involves a peer group of patients. 'Limited evidence' shows that specialist in-patient rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) and specialist multi-disciplinary community rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) may provide additional functional gains, but studies (known to be associated with a health-related condition considered important to prevent.) serve to highlight the particular practical and ethical restraints imposed on randomisation of severely affected individuals for whom no realistic alternatives to specialist intervention (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.) are available. Problems following ABI vary. Consequently, different intervention (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.)s and combinations of intervention (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.)s are required to meet the needs of patients with different problems. Patients who present acutely to hospital with mild brain injury benefit from follow-up and appropriate information and advice. Those with moderate to severe brain injury benefit from routine follow-up so their needs for rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) can be assessed. Intensive intervention (Complete closure of the normally patent lumen of the blood vessels which carry blood away from the heart.) (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.) appears to lead to earlier gains, and earlier intervention (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.) whilst still in emergency and acute care has been supported by limited evidence. The balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined. Patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) benefit from access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs.

Not all questions in rehabilitation (The muscular membranous segment between the PHARYNX and the STOMACH in the UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. For example, trial-based literature does not tell us which treatments (A measurement expressed in words rather than numbers.) work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care. In the future, such questions will need to be considered alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic longitudinal cohort studies (known to be associated with a health-related condition considered important to prevent.) conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.",

                "Studies eligible for inclusion in this review were controlled trials, in which one group of people received treatment (such as MD rehabilitation) and was compared with a similar group that received a different treatment. We found 19 relevant studies, which involved a total of 3480 people. We searched the medical literature worldwide on 14 September 2015. We used the Van Tulder system to rate the strength of the evidence as it distinguished better between trials of different quality than the standard GRADE system on criteria that are important in the context of rehabilitation. For mild brain injury, information and advice were usually more appropriate than intensive rehabilitation. As a whole, studies suggest that patients with moderate to severe brain injury who received more intensive rehabilitation showed earlier improvement, and that earlier rehabilitation was better than delayed treatment. Strong evidence supports the provision of cognitive rehabilitation in a therapeutic 'milieu', that is, an environment in which patients receive predominantly group-based rehabilitation alongside a peer group of others who are facing similar challenges. Trial-based literature provided little evidence related to other aspects of MD rehabilitation, so the review authors recommend that additional research should be done. Rehabilitation for brain injury is such an individualised and long-term process that research studies do not necessarily facilitate general conclusions. Overall the included studies were of good quality; 12 of 19 studies were judged to be of high quality according to the van Tulder scoring system. The other studies were at risk of bias because of elements of their design, for example, in one study, treatment depended on the availability of a bed in the rehabilitation unit. Bed availability is a haphazard way of allocating treatment to patients, and this makes results of the study prone to bias."

The factorial design took into account two factors (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.), i.e. infant location in relation to the mother and the type of infant apparel. We combined three of the groups as the intervention (rooming-in) group and the fourth group acted as the control (separate care) and we analysed the results as a single pair-wise comparison. Primary outcomes The primary outcome, duration of any breastfeeding, was reported by authors as median values because the distribution was found to be skewed. They reported the overall median duration of any breastfeeding to be four months, with no difference found between groups. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the proportion of infants being exclusively breastfed at six months of age was not reported in the trial. There was no difference found between the two groups in the proportion of infants receiving any breastfeeding at six months of age (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.39; one trial; 137 women; low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes The mean frequency of breastfeeds per day on day four postpartum for the rooming-in group was 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 2.2), slightly higher than the separate care group, i.e. seven times per day. However, between-group comparison of this outcome was not appropriate since every infant in the separate care group was breastfed at a fixed schedule of seven times per day (SD = 0) resulting in no estimable comparison. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding on day four postpartum before discharge from hospital was significantly higher in the rooming-in group 86% (99 of 115) compared with separate care group, 45% (17 of 38), (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.76; one trial, 153 women; low-quality evidence).

This review shows that when given PDE5 inhibitors, on average people walked 48 meters further in six minutes (8 trials, 880 people). They also improved their functional class (reducing the physical limitations associated with PH), and were less likely to die (high-certainty evidence). They were also more likely to have side effects, including headache, flushing and muscle aches. Five trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to left-heart disease. This review shows that when given PDE5 inhibitors, these people were on average able to walk 34 metres further in six minutes (3 trials, 284 people; low-certainty evidence). However, there was no difference in survival, compared to those who were not given PDE5 inhibitors. Five trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease (mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and some idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). When given PDE5 inhibitors, they were able to walk 27 meters further in six minutes (low-certainty evidence), but with no difference in survival, compared to those who were not given PDE5 inhibitors. Three trials included people with pulmonary hypertension due to blood clots; there was no significant difference in outcomes for those who used PDE5 inhibitors compared to those who did not. There was good-quality evidence for those with pulmonary arterial hypertension, giving us some confidence that the results are correct. The evidence for those with pulmonary hypertension due to heart disease was less certain. The quality of evidence in this group was low because there were few trials, small numbers of people taking part, and the trials were quite different from each other, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions."

'Risk of bias' assessment indicated that trial design and conduct were generally adequate; the most common areas of weakness (Of or relating to or practicing gynecology; pertaining to the health issues of women.) were in blinding and allocation concealment. Nine trials comparing double versus single injections (The giving of drugs, chemicals, or other substances by mouth.) showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.89, high-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve location showed that the effect size was greater when neurostimulation (A chest X-ray finding indicating the presence of a radio-opaque area in the lung.) was used rather than the transarterial technique. Nine trials comparing multiple with single injections (The giving of drugs, chemicals, or other substances by mouth.) showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.42, high-quality evidence). Pooled data from five trials also showed a significant decrease in incomplete motor block (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.96, high-quality evidence) in the multiple-injection group. Twelve trials comparing multiple versus double injections (The giving of drugs, chemicals, or other substances by mouth.) showed a statistically significant decrease in primary anaesthesia failure (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.39, high-quality evidence). Pooled data from six trials also showed a significant decrease in incomplete motor block (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.85, high-quality evidence) in the multiple injection group.

Otherwise there were no statistically significant differences between groups in any of the three comparisons on secondary analgesia failure, complications (prevented from erupting by a physical barrier, usually other teeth.) and patient discomfort. Compared with multiple injections (The giving of drugs, chemicals, or other substances by mouth.), the time for block performance was significantly shorter for single injection (MD 3.33 minutes, 95% CI 2.76 to 3.90) and double injections (The giving of drugs, chemicals, or other substances by mouth.) (MD 1.54 minutes, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.29); however there was no difference in time to readiness for surgery. This review provides evidence that multiple-injection techniques using nerve stimulation (An acute inflammatory process that leads to necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma.) for axillary plexus block produce more effective anaesthesia than either double or single-injection techniques. However, there was insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions regarding differences in other outcomes, including safety.",

These trials involved a total of 2193 participants who were given regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery. The trials used methods that were generally adequate and did not affect the validity of the findings. Nine trials compared double versus single injections. These found that people in the double-injection group had a 45% reduction in their chance of needing additional anaesthesia. The effect was more certain in the four trials where the nerves were located using the more precise method of neurostimulation. In the nine trials comparing multiple with single injections, and the 12 trials comparing multiple with double injections, there were significant reductions in the chance of needing additional anaesthesia in the multiple-injection groups (75% and 73% reductions when compared to single and double injections respectively). In addition, people in the multiple-injection group were 47% less likely to experience pain from the surgical tourniquet compared to the double-injection group. There were no other statistically significant differences in complications or patient discomfort between the two groups for any of the three comparisons. Single and double injections took less time to perform than multiple injections, but this did not reduce the total time required for adequate surgical anaesthesia to be established. Overall, there is high-quality evidence showing that multiple injections of anaesthetic close to three or four nerves in the armpit provide more complete anaesthesia for hand and forearm surgery than one or two injections. There was, however, not enough evidence to determine if there was a significant difference in the other outcomes, including safety."

Neither treat (An inflammatory process with loss of supporting bone in the tissues surrounding functioning DENTAL IMPLANTS.)ment is associated with adverse outcomes. Further studies (The organ of sight constituting a pair of globular organs made up of a three-layered roughly spherical structure specialized for receiving and responding to light.) should employ a rigorous randomisation technique, blinded outcome assessment, a post-treat (An inflammatory process with loss of supporting bone in the tissues surrounding functioning DENTAL IMPLANTS.)ment Dix-Hallpike test as an outcome measure and longer-term follow-up of patients.",

                "We included 11 studies in this review, with a total of 855 participants. Nine studies looked at post-treatment postural restrictions (using a neck brace/head movement restrictions/instructions to sleep upright) following the Epley manoeuvre. There was a statistically significant difference found when these restrictions were compared to a control treatment of the Epley manoeuvre alone. Although there was a difference between the groups, adding postural restrictions conferred only a small additional benefit since the Epley manoeuvre was effective alone in just under 80% of patients. Four of the studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV (a subtype of BPPV which is similar to posterior canal BPPV, but has some distinct differences in terms of the signs and symptoms), dizziness and disequilibrium (the feeling of unsteadiness on ones feet) in some patients. Additionally, two studies looked into the application of oscillation/vibration to the mastoid region during the Epley manoeuvre compared to control; the intervention produced no difference in outcome between these groups. One study that also researched post-treatment postural restrictions looked into extra steps in the Epley manoeuvre. Compared to the control treatment there were no significant differences in outcomes. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies in the review. The results should be interpreted carefully and further trials are needed."

                "Four randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 231 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, are included in this review. The number of patients in each study ranged from 34 to 109. The studies took place in ENT departments in several European countries. All patients were adults and most of the studies enrolled more men than women. In all studies the patients were randomly assigned to either surgery or medical treatment (such as antibiotics or steroid tablets or injections) in addition to topical steroids given as nasal sprays or drops. Both the type of surgery performed and the medical treatments used varied widely between the studies, and did not allow all of the studies to be looked at together. Rather, we considered the treatment groups in the four studies as three separate pairs of comparisons instead of simply 'surgical' versus 'medical' treatments. The main outcome measures were patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores and health-related quality of life scores, as well as generic health-related quality of life scores. There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) did not find a difference in general health-related quality of life scores. Two studies reported changes in polyp size (when looked at with an endoscope) using a score. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a significantly better score in the surgery group than in the steroids group at 12 months. In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups. There were no reported differences between the different medical and surgical treatment groups in any study for any other objective (clinician-based) measurements. Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but nosebleeds (epistaxis) were the most commonly described complication with both medical and surgical treatment; severe complications were reported rarely in either group. The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. One positive finding (polyps size scores) from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. There is not enough evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the most appropriate treatment for this condition. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has significant implications for quality of life and the use of healthcare services. Further research to investigate this problem is justified. Overall, we found this evidence to be of low or very low quality. We have low confidence in the estimates of these studies; further research will very likely change these estimates. There were serious limitations in how the studies were carried out or reported (or both), and the number of participants involved was small. In addition, some of the treatment regimens used in the trials are no longer current standards of therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. This evidence is up to date to 20 February 2014."

Participants receiving antiandrogens were also more likely to stop treatment as the result of side effects. The risk of suffering breast pain, enlargement of breast tissue or symptoms of physical weakness was also increased with non-steroidal antiandrogens. The risks of feeling intense heat with sweating and rapid heartbeat and of bleeding, the need to get up in the night to urinate, loss of sexual interest, extreme tiredness and the need to urinate more often than usual were increased with castration. No difference was noted for other side effects. The effect of non-steroidal antiandrogens on cancer-specific survival and biochemical progression remained unclear.

The studies which provided the most reliable information showed that screening did not reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies that were potentially more biased (less carefully done) found that screening reduced breast cancer mortality. However, screening will result in some women getting a cancer diagnosis even though their cancer would not have led to death or sickness. Currently, it is not possible to tell which women these are, and they are therefore likely to have breasts or lumps removed and to receive radiotherapy unnecessarily.

The study comparing 20,000 units hCG (The interactions between parent and child.) with 10,000 units hCG (The interactions between parent and child.) did not report sufficient data to enable us to calculate odds ratios.

Analyses assessing the effects of treatment over time found that both ERT (The study of chance processes or the relative frequency characterizing a chance process.) and HRT (Antigen-type substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity (HYPERSENSITIVITY, IMMEDIATE).) did not maintain or improve cognitive function and may even adversely affect this outcome (WMD = -0.45, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.09; WMD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.26, respectively at maximum follow up).

Results from smaller trials assessing effects on individual cognitive domains mostly reported no evidence of benefit. There is good evidence that both ERT (The study of chance processes or the relative frequency characterizing a chance process.) and HRT (Antigen-type substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity (HYPERSENSITIVITY, IMMEDIATE).) do not prevent cognitive decline (Multi-subunit proteins which function in IMMUNITY.) in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. It is not known whether either specific types of ERT (The study of chance processes or the relative frequency characterizing a chance process.) or HRT (Antigen-type substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity (HYPERSENSITIVITY, IMMEDIATE).) have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy (Organizations which provide an environment encouraging social interactions through group activities or individual relationships especially for the purpose of rehabilitating or supporting patients, individuals with common health problems, or the elderly.) in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory test (College, University or institute with scholastic life or environment.)s and a small improvement in a test (College, University or institute with scholastic life or environment.) of figural memory. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy (Organizations which provide an environment encouraging social interactions through group activities or individual relationships especially for the purpose of rehabilitating or supporting patients, individuals with common health problems, or the elderly.) could benefit from treatment. It remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age (< 60 years of age), type of menopause (surgical (A drug used to reduce hemorrhage in diabetic retinopathy.) or natural) and type of treatment (type of estrogen (a precursor of VITAMIN A.) with or without a progestagen (Physical and behavioral responses associated with death)), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular) and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level. In addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. Large RCTs currently underway in the USA may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010. In the meantime, based on the available evidence, ERT (The study of chance processes or the relative frequency characterizing a chance process.) or HRT (Antigen-type substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity (HYPERSENSITIVITY, IMMEDIATE).) cannot be recommended for overall cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment (Smoke from burning tobacco (cigarettes, cigars, or pipes) and exhaled by a smoker.).",

Based on analysis (The procedure or activity of determining something by mathematical or logical methods.) of primary and secondary outcomes, we are uncertain whether once-daily ICS/LABA, combined in one inhaler (The act of alteration or modification; changed or altered in form or character.), has a different efficacy or adverse effect profile compared to LAMA for treatment of people with COPD. However, the current review is based on only two trials with the main focus on primary outcomes other than those considered in this review. The short follow-up period and the very low quality of evidence limit our confidence in the result and increase uncertainty. Further trials of longer duration are needed. Current evidence is not strong enough to demonstrate important differences between inhaler (The act of alteration or modification; changed or altered in form or character.)s in terms of effects, nor to establish that once-daily fluticasone/vilanterol (The part of the respiratory system between the nose or mouth and the lungs.) 100/25 mcg and tiotropium (Agents that prevent fibrinolysis or lysis of a blood clot or thrombus.) 18 mcg are equivalent.",

The main reasons for such judgement include the small number of identified studies and the fact that these studies were not focused on the outcomes of interest for this review.

Adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and none of the people in the active treatment groups were reported to have dropped out of the studies because of treatment-emergent adverse events. There is preliminary evidence from one trial of CBT that the effects of CBT may persist once treatment has ended. Treatment response in the medication trials was not effected by the degree to which people had insight into their condition.

Our evidence assessment of plasma interleukin-6 concentrations for the diagnosis of sepsis (Persistent difficulty with speech sound production such that it interferes with verbal communication.) in critically ill (creation of a fistula between the anterior chamber of the eye and the subconjunctival space by surgical removal of a portion of the trabecular meshwork, performed to facilitate drainage of the aqueous humor in glaucoma.) adults reveals several limitations. High heterogeneity of collected evidence regarding the main diagnosis, setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis (Persistent difficulty with speech sound production such that it interferes with verbal communication.) criteria, year of publication, and the origin of infection (involved in glycolysis.), among other factors (A stretching or tearing of a ligament.), along with the potential number of misclassifications, remain significant constraints for its implementation. The 20 conference proceedings assessed as studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once they are fully published and evaluated. Further studies about the accuracy of interleukin-6 for the diagnosis of sepsis (Persistent difficulty with speech sound production such that it interferes with verbal communication.) in adults that apply rigorous methodology for conducting diagnostic test accuracy studies are needed. The conclusions of the review will likely change once the 20 studies pending publication are fully published and included.",

                "We performed a thorough literature search for studies reporting the use of IL-6 levels for detection of sepsis up to January 2019. We found 23 studies enrolling 4192 severely ill adults. Our assessment of the evidence reveals the complexity of the research topic, represented in the high variability of information reported by the studies. We found the characteristics of assessed patients to vary considerably between studies in terms of age, gender, setting, initial diagnosis, indicative value for sepsis, and source of infection, among other factors. This variability in the collected data prevented a formal numerical synthesis of the findings. Using the available data to perform an approximated estimation of the consequences, we found that 700 out of 1000 patients under suspicion of sepsis might be correctly classified, but 130 out of 1000 patients would be wrongly considered as having sepsis, while 170 out of 1000 patients might be incorrectly considered as not having sepsis. These errors would result in a serious increase in the risk of further morbidity and death due to delays of adequate treatment. This information should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the collected data. We judged the included studies to have important limitations in their validity, hence they are at high risk of providing distorted results (i.e. to be at high risk of bias)."

Primary outcome: SSI It is uncertain whether wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared with alternative options investigated: we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for most comparisons (and low for others), with downgrading (according to GRADE criteria) largely due to risk of bias and imprecision. We summarise the results of comparisons with meta-analysed data below: - film dressings (Abnormal communication most commonly seen between two internal organs, or between an internal organ and the surface of the body.) compared with basic wound contact dressings (Abnormal communication most commonly seen between two internal organs, or between an internal organ and the surface of the body.)

Secondary outcomes There was limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring, acceptability of dressing and ease of removal (A potentially life-threatening condition in which EMBRYO IMPLANTATION occurs outside the cavity of the UTERUS.), and uncertainty whether wound dressings (A powerful central nervous system stimulant and sympathomimetic.)

It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings (A powerful central nervous system stimulant and sympathomimetic.) (Abnormal communication most commonly seen between two internal organs, or between an internal organ and the surface of the body.) reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring, reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove.

This review examined data from 29 randomised controlled trials (which provide the most reliable evidence). These investigated the use of dressings in surgery that had a low risk of surgical site infection (clean surgery) and surgery with a higher risk (potentially contaminated surgery). We found no clear evidence to suggest that one dressing type was better than any other at reducing the risk of surgical site infection, nor that covering wounds with any dressing at all reduced the risk of surgical site infection. Additionally, there was no clear evidence that any dressing type improves scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of removal. Currently decision makers may opt to make decisions about whether and how to dress a wound based on patient and clinician preferences and dressing costs. It is important to note that many trials in this review were small and the evidence was of low or very low certainty meaning that current information is uncertain.

The trial randomised 179 women but outcome data were only provided for 85 women. Eighty-three women were randomised to each arm of the trial. Sixty-one women completed the selenium (A lack of occurrence or performance.) arm, 44 of whom completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In the placebo (A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei.) arm, 64 women completed the trial, 41 of whom completed an EPDS. This included study (n = 85) found selenium (A lack of occurrence or performance.) had an effect on EPDS scores but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). There was a mean difference (MD) of -1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.92 to 0.12) of the self-reported EPDS completed by participants within eight weeks of delivery. There was a high risk of attrition bias due to a large proportion of women withdrawing from the study or not completing an EPDS.

One study examined the effect of selenium supplements taken by women from the first trimester to birth in preventing postnatal depression.

It may also have been difficult to ensure that the women took their supplements because of concerns that exist about taking supplements during pregnancy. More high-quality studies would be required to confirm any benefit in preventing postnatal depression using selenium. This review also identified one randomised controlled study that compared docosahexanoic and eicosapentaenoic acid to placebo in women at risk of postpartum depression. This study found that neither docosahexanoic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid prevented postpartum depression. Overall, there is not enough evidence at this stage to recommend selenium, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or any other dietary supplement for the prevention of postnatal depression. Unfortunately there were no other studies of other dietary supplements that met our selection criteria. Other dietary supplements need to be studied in trials where depressed women are excluded from entry to determine if supplements prevent postnatal depression."

Since there is only a small amount of data for children and data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion (General increase in bulk of a part or organ due to CELL ENLARGEMENT and accumulation of FLUIDS AND SECRETIONS, not due to tumor formation, nor to an increase in the number of cells (HYPERPLASIA).) durations should be evaluated further in children. We identified no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure in participants treated with (Difficult to analyze or understand.) a doxorubicin (A human monoclonal antibody directed against the human interleukins 12 (IL-12) and 23 (IL-23), with immunomodulating activity.) peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 or more.

Only a small amount of data was available for children and individuals with leukaemia, since most studies evaluating different anthracycline infusion durations were performed in adults with solid tumours.

Most studies commenced treatment immediately on admission to hospital or after craniotomies (The region of the upper limb in animals, extending from the deltoid region to the HAND, and including the ARM; AXILLA; and SHOULDER.) and all treatment was maintained for at least 24 hours.

Studies were generally poorly reported and we were unable to assess risk of bias adequately. Heterogeneity was evident both in the trial designs and participant inclusion. Inconsistencies in results may be explained by heterogeneity among study participants or bias introduced by individual study methodology but we did not explore this in detail in subgroup or sensitivity analyses.

We analysed seven randomised controlled trials including 960 participants that compared drain insertion with no drainage after axillary lymphadenectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. We found that the chance of getting a seroma if a drain was inserted was less than if no drain was inserted (0.46 times less likely), and that the number of aspirations required (using a needle to drain seroma fluid in the outpatient clinic) was lower (on average, 0.79 fewer per participant). These benefits must be balanced against a longer average hospital stay of 1.47 days in the drained population, although increasingly patients can be discharged with their drain in place, to be removed at a later date. Risk of infection, volume of fluid aspirated and rates of lymphoedema (arm swelling) or haematoma (bruising) did not differ between drained and undrained participants."

The calculated number needed to treat to achieve an increase in sustained virological response proportions was nine (meaning that among nine participants treated for 72 weeks instead of 48 weeks, only one more will achieve a sustained virological response compared to the participants treated for 48 weeks). The higher sustained virological response after 72 weeks of treatment was caused by a reduction in the number of patients in this group who experienced a virological relapse after treatment. Adherence to treatment was not different between the two groups. Serious adverse events were mentioned in only one trial, and they were not different in the two treatment groups.

Subgroup analysis (A feeling of mental or physical uneasiness, pain, or distress.) of included studies using lightweight mesh (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.) showed the reduction of chronic pain (Made or joined or united into one or involving the joint activity of two or more.) was less profound and insignificant (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.17). Subgroup analysis (A feeling of mental or physical uneasiness, pain, or distress.) of included studies using heavyweight mesh (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.) resulted in a significant benefit from the fixation with glue (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.82). Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.28; 12 studies, 1932 participants, low-quality evidence). Fixation (The smaller lobe of the liver extending into the left side of the body.) with glue was superior to suture (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.) regarding duration of the operation (A large group of rod-shaped bacteria that retains the crystal violet stain when treated by Gram's method.)

We also investigated adverse events (A chest X-ray finding indicating the presence of a radio-opaque area in the lung.). There were no significant differences between the two groups.

Finally, six trials involving 1009 participants reported postoperative length of stay, resulting in non-significant difference between the two groups (MD \u22120.12, 95% CI: \u22120.35 to 0.10) Due to the lack of data, it was impossible to draw any distinction between synthetic glue and biological glue. Eight out of 12 trials showed high risk of bias in at least one of the investigated domains. Two studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and the allocation sequence of one trial was not concealed. Nearly half of the included trials either did not provide adequate information or had high risk of bias regarding blinding processes. The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies varied from low to high risk of bias. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant (A collective generic term that refers here to a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states.). Therefore, according to the 'Summary of findings' tables, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low. Based on the short-term results, glue may reduce postoperative chronic pain (Made or joined or united into one or involving the joint activity of two or more.) and not simultaneously increase the recurrence rate, compared with suture (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.)s for mesh (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.) fixation in Lichtenstein hernia repair. Glue may therefore be a sensible alternative to suture (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.) for mesh (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.) fixation in Lichtenstein repair. Larger trials with longer follow-up and high quality are warranted. The difference between synthetic glue and biological glue should also be assessed in the future.",

Glue fixation is superior to suture for the outcomes of chronic pain, duration of operation, haematoma and recovery time to daily activities. Glue fixation is not associated with an increased risk of infection, hernia recurrence, seroma (a collection of fluid that builds up under the surface of the skin after surgery), persisting numbness (loss of sensation or feeling), quality of life, and postoperative length of stay. We do not know the role of glue fixation in people with recurrent hernia, femoral hernia or complicated hernia. Meanwhile no conclusions could be drawn on which type of glue should be used because of lack of trials. Eight out of 12 trials showed high risk of bias in at least one of the investigated domains.

The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies is low to high. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant. As the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low and the results of chronic pain is not robust, the findings should be interpreted with caution. However, the evidence is still sufficient to conclude that glue fixation of mesh for the Lichtenstein procedure is comparable, if not superior, to fixation with suture.

Eleven studies (Express the need or desire for; ask for.) reported treatment group mean measures of pain intensity or pain relief; overall for these outcome measures, codeine or codeine plus (The tree-in-bud pattern represents centrilobular branching structures that resemble a budding tree.) paracetamol was numerically superior to placebo (Precursor of an alkylating nitrogen mustard antineoplastic and immunosuppressive agent that must be activated in the LIVER to form the active aldophosphamide.) and equivalent to the active comparators. Adverse event reporting was poor: only two studies (Express the need or desire for; ask for.) reported the number of participants with any adverse event specified by treatment group and only one reported the number of participants with any serious adverse event.

We cannot be certain about how many people will get this benefit, and we do not know whether, or by how much, adding paracetamol increases its effect. Codeine increases nausea, vomiting, and constipation, and may cause drowsiness or dizziness if used for more than a week. Some people will stop taking codeine because of the side effects. More trials comparing codeine with other treatments and using patient-centred outcomes are needed.

Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and the post-intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. The heterogeneity of the included trials, which encompasses setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, interventional method and time of assessment, ranged from 'not important' to 'moderate to substantial' for different review outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low for selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and blinding of outcome assessment. Incomplete outcome reporting and blinding of personnel showed mixed bias representations. Patient knowledge was assessed by four trials (160 participants) with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. There was evidence that educational programs improved patient knowledge, standardised mean difference 0.87 points (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 1.45, moderate quality evidence), which improved further when a trial with high bias was removed in a sensitivity (The determination of oxygen-hemoglobin saturation of blood either by withdrawing a sample and passing it through a classical photoelectric oximeter or by electrodes attached to some translucent part of the body like finger, earlobe, or skin fold.) analysis. Caregiver knowledge, reported in a single trial of 20 families, also showed an improvement, standardised mean difference 0.52 points (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.00, moderate quality evidence). The effect on patient knowledge was sustained at longer follow-up periods, whereas the effect on caregiver knowledge was not sustained. There were two primary outcomes related to the effectiveness of educational programs on the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease-related morbidity. No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self-management. Data from two trials were analysed for the utilization of health services and showed no evidence of an effect, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -0.57 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence). With regard to the review's secondary outcomes, depression (manually pulled through the birth canal.) showed a statistically significant decline in intervention groups, standardised mean difference -0.66 points (95% confidence interval -1.18, to -0.14, moderate quality evidence). Adherence to treatment was not assessed in any of the identified trials. No effects of interventions were seen on coping, family relationships or health-related quality of life of patients.

Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effect on knowledge was significant but small and whether it offers any clinical benefit is uncertain. Significant factors limiting these effects could be trials being under powered as well as attrition rates. Effects were not statistically significant in assessments of secondary outcomes, possibly due to the paucity of the number of trials and patients and caregivers. Trials showed moderate to high heterogeneity which might impact the results. To better study effects on outcomes, further controlled trials are needed with rigorous attention given to improve recruitment (The giving of advice and assistance to individuals with educational or personal problems.) and retention and to decrease bias.

Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and post-intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. Educational programs and other interventions have resulted in improvements in patient knowledge or understanding of sickle cell disease, and a decrease in depression. Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effects are shown to be small but may result from the fact that most studies had very small numbers of participants and there was much variation between studies.

No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self-management. No trials assessed the adherence to treatment.

We judged two studies (necessary for normal growth in infants and for NITROGEN balance in adults.) to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of bias.

One study did not describe how blinding was maintained, and another noted discrepancies in reporting.

Brivaracetam, when used as add-on therapy for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, is effective in reducing seizure frequency and can aid patients in achieving seizure freedom (Failure to meet, or late achievement of developmental milestones.). However, add-on brivaracetam (A child between 1 and 23 months of age.) is associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events compared with placebo. It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies (necessary for normal growth in infants and for NITROGEN balance in adults.) included participants with generalised epilepsy. None of the studies (necessary for normal growth in infants and for NITROGEN balance in adults.) included participants under the age of 16, and all studies (necessary for normal growth in infants and for NITROGEN balance in adults.) were of short duration. Consequently, these findings are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Future research should thus focus on investigating the tolerability and efficacy of brivaracetam (A child between 1 and 23 months of age.) during longer-term follow-up, and should also assess the efficacy and tolerability of add-on brivaracetam (A child between 1 and 23 months of age.) in managing other types of seizures (A vital statistic measuring or recording the rate of death from any cause in hospitalized populations.) and its use in other age groups.",

Evidence regarding the tolerability of brivaracetam, for example, the number of people who withdrew from these studies and the number of people who experienced side effects, however, was of low quality. This means that we cannot be sure that trial findings are completely accurate, and that more research is needed to fully investigate the tolerability of brivaracetam. All study participants were adults, and most had focal epilepsy. As a result, the review cannot inform us about how effective brivaracetam is in children or in individuals with other types of epilepsy, for example, generalised epilepsy, which is epilepsy that involves the whole brain.

There were no differences in overall dropout rates between individual psychological therapies and TAU (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.). Two trials found a non-specific specialist therapy (Specialist Supportive Clinical Management) or an Optimised TAU (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) delivered by therapists with eating disorder (Condition changed and/or recovered) expertise was similar in outcomes to cognitive behaviour therapy (An extremely rare multiple congenital malformation syndrome with the association of ablepharon, macrostomia, abnormal external ears, syndactyly of the hands and feet, skin findings (such as dry and coarse skin or redundant folds of skin), absent or sparse hair, genital malformations and developmental delay in two thirds of cases.) (BMI (a trace element and member of the halogen family.) MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.91; 197 participants, low-quality evidence). When comparing individual psychological therapies with each other, no specific treatment was consistently superior to any other specific approach. Dietary advice as a control arm had a 100% non-completion rate in one trial (35 participants). None of the trials identified any adverse effects. Insufficient power was problematic for the majority of trials. There was a suggestion in one trial that focal psychodynamic therapy might be superior to TAU (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.), but this is in the context of TAU (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) performing poorly. An alternative control condition of dietary advice alone appeared to be unacceptable, but again this is based on just one trial. Owing to the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents. Larger RCTs of longer treatment duration and follow-up are needed.",

Most therapies appeared as acceptable as any other approach, except for dietary advice which had a 100% non-completion rate in one small trial. Because of the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents.

One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades. The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.)) versus standard silicone oil (A narcotic analgesic proposed for severe pain.) (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference). In participants with RD associated with PVR (formed primarily in the kidney by enzymatic hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (CALCIFEDIOL).), outcomes after pars plana vitrectomy and infusion of either silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.), perfluropropane gas, or sulfur hexafluoride gas appeared comparable for a broad variety of cases. There were no significant differences between silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) and perfluoropropane gas (To fasten, grip, or support with or as if with a clamp.) in terms of the proportion of participants achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.31) or achieving macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) at a minimum of one year. Although sulfur hexafluoride gas was reported to be associated with significantly worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) at one year (quantitative data not reported), there were no significant differences between silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) and sulfur hexafluoride gas in terms of achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66). For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) received significantly more favourable outcomes than did participants who received sulfur hexafluoride at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86). The first two trials did not perform any sample size calculation or power detection (Discharge or drainage of fluid from the ear.). In the third trial, which had a power of 80% to detect differences, heavy silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) was not shown to be superior to standard silicone oil (A narcotic analgesic proposed for severe pain.) (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.). There were no significant differences between standard silicone oil (A narcotic analgesic proposed for severe pain.) (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) and heavy silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) in the change in visual acuity at one year using adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29). Adverse events (Procedure to cause two adjacent structures to be structurally joined together) were not reported for the first two trials. For the third trial, only the total number of adverse events (The detailed planning of studies of the safety, efficacy, or optimum dosage schedule (if appropriate) of one or more diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic drugs, devices, or techniques selected according to predetermined criteria of eligibility and observed for predefined evidence of favorable and unfavorable effects.) was reported, and adverse events (The detailed planning of studies of the safety, efficacy, or optimum dosage schedule (if appropriate) of one or more diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic drugs, devices, or techniques selected according to predetermined criteria of eligibility and observed for predefined evidence of favorable and unfavorable effects.) for each group were not specified. Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal (Infections caused by bacteria that retain the crystal violet stain (positive) when treated by the gram-staining method.) detachment, 22 developed glaucoma, four developed a cataract, and two had capsular fibrosis. All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors. The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias. All trials appear to be free of reporting bias. The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation. The use of either perfluropropane or standard silicone oil (A narcotic analgesic proposed for severe pain.) (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.) appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR (formed primarily in the kidney by enzymatic hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (CALCIFEDIOL).). Because there do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between the two agents (Having to do with nerves or the nervous system.), the choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. Heavy silicone oil (Decompression external to the body, most often the slow lessening of external pressure on the whole body (especially in caisson workers, deep sea divers, and persons who ascend to great heights) to prevent DECOMPRESSION SICKNESS.), which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has not demonstrated evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil (A narcotic analgesic proposed for severe pain.)

                "We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 516 participants that compared tamponade agents. All participants underwent surgery to treat RD associated with PVR. The Silicone Study compared the use of silicone oil to either sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas in two RCTs. Both gases and silicone oil are less dense than water, so that they float upwards or towards the top of the eye while a patient is sitting or standing. This is sometimes but not always beneficial, so a denser-than-water silicone oil called heavy silicone oil has been investigated, primarily outside the US. The Heavy Silicone Oil Study compared the use of heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil in participants with RD involving the lower parts of the retina. The evidence was current to June 2013. When silicone oil was compared to SF6 gas, eyes randomized to receive silicone oil more often achieved a visual acuity of 5/200 or better at one year, and more often achieved macular attachment at one year but with no difference at two years. When silicone oil was compared with C3F8 gas, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to visual acuity or macular attachment at one year. When heavy silicone oil was compared to standard silicone oil, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to retinal re-attachment or visual acuity at one year. Heavy silicone oil did not demonstrate any significant benefit over standard silicone oil. Adverse events were only reported for the Heavy Silicone Oil Study; however, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and the numbers for each group were not specified: of the 94 participants, there were four deaths, 26 recurrent RDs, 22 patients with glaucoma, four patients with cataract, and two patients with capsular fibrosis (scarring behind a lens implant). The overall quality of these studies was moderately satisfactory. Although all trials employed proper randomization methods for participants, the masking of participants was unclear in all of the three RCTs, and masking of outcome assessors was not performed in two RCTs."

(risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.), 1459 women (evidence graded high)). There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis (A cylindrical column of tissue that lies within the vertebral canal.) by gestational age, gestational week or condition (formed by the distal end of the RADIUS, the articular disc of the distal radioulnar joint, and the proximal row of CARPAL BONES; (SCAPHOID BONE; LUNATE BONE; triquetral bone).). Planned early delivery (A dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound.) was associated with lower risk of HELLP syndrome (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93, 1628 women; three studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.)) and severe renal impairment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.92, 100 women, one study). There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on composite infant mortality and severe morbidity. We observed a high level of heterogeneity between the two studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.) in this analysis (A cylindrical column of tissue that lies within the vertebral canal.) (two studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.), 1459 infants, I2 = 87%, Tau2 = 0.98), so we did not pool data in meta-analysis (A cylindrical column of tissue that lies within the vertebral canal.).

Planned early delivery (A dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound.) was associated with higher levels of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.20 to 4.18, three studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.), 1511 infants), and NICU admission (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40, four studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.), 1585 infants). There was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (Incision of SPHINCTER OF ODDI or VATER'S AMPULLA performed by inserting a sphincterotome through DUODENOSCOPE often following or performed during ERCP (ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY).)

Two fairly large, well-designed trials with overall low risk of bias contributed the majority of the evidence. Other studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.) were at low or unclear risk of bias. No studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.) attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation, potentially introducing bias as women and staff would have been aware of the intervention (A syndrome characterized by progressive life-threatening RESPIRATORY INSUFFICIENCY in the absence of known LUNG DISEASES, usually following a systemic insult such as surgery or major TRAUMA.) and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making. The level of evidence was graded high (composite maternal mortality and morbidity), moderate (caesarean section (Incision of SPHINCTER OF ODDI or VATER'S AMPULLA performed by inserting a sphincterotome through DUODENOSCOPE often following or performed during ERCP (ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY).), duration of hospital stay after delivery (A dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound.) for mother, and duration of hospital stay after delivery (A dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound.) for baby) or low (composite infant mortality and morbidity). Where the evidence was downgraded, it was mostly because the confidence intervals were wide, crossing both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm. For women suffering (The total score for myelodysplastic syndrome progression that considers the percentage of blasts in bone marrow (scored on a scale from zero to 2), chromosome abnormalities (scored from zero to 1), and the patient's blood counts (scored as zero or 0.5).) from hypertensive disorders (Stones in the KIDNEY, usually formed in the urine-collecting area of the kidney (KIDNEY PELVIS).) of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery (A dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound.) is associated with less composite maternal morbidity and mortality. There is no clear difference in the composite outcome of infant mortality and severe morbidity; however, this is based on limited data (from two trials) assessing all hypertensive disorders (Stones in the KIDNEY, usually formed in the urine-collecting area of the kidney (KIDNEY PELVIS).) as one group. Further studies (The fourth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.) are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive disease (a delay in development based on that expected for a given age level or stage of development.)s and the optimal timing of delivery (A dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound.) for these condition (formed by the distal end of the RADIUS, the articular disc of the distal radioulnar joint, and the proximal row of CARPAL BONES; (SCAPHOID BONE; LUNATE BONE; triquetral bone).)s.

Fewer women who received planned early delivery experienced severe adverse outcomes (1459 women, high-quality evidence). There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on the number of babies born with poor health, with a high level of variability between the two studies (1459 infants, low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference between planned early delivery and delayed delivery for the number of caesarean sections (four studies, 1728 women, moderate-quality evidence), or the duration of the mother\u2019s hospital stay after the birth of the baby (two studies, 925 women, moderate-quality evidence) (or for the baby (one study, 756 infants, moderate-quality evidence)). More babies who were delivered early had breathing problems (respiratory distress syndrome, three studies, 1511 infants), or were admitted to the neonatal unit (four studies, 1585 infants). Fewer women who delivered early developed HELLP syndrome (three studies, 1628 women) or severe kidney problems (one study, 100 women). Two studies compared women who had labour induced at 34 to 36 weeks and at 34 to 37 weeks with a comparison group who were monitored until 37 weeks, when induction was begun if labour had not started spontaneously. Three studies compared induction of labour at term or closer to term, at 37 completed weeks and at 36 to 41 weeks, with women who were monitored until 41 weeks when induction was begun if labour had not started spontaneously. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria also differed between the five studies. No studies attempted to blind the women or their clinicians to which group they were in. Women and staff were aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making. Most of the evidence was of moderate quality, so we can be moderately certain about the findings. Overall, if a woman\u2019s baby was delivered immediately after 34 weeks, there was less risk of a complication for the mother and no clear difference in the overall rate of complications for the baby, but information was limited. These findings are applicable to general obstetric practice when high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy are considered together. Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive disorders individually."

It was clearly evident that preventative therapy, as intravenous infusion of factor concentrate repeated more times a week and started early in childhood was able to reduce joint deterioration as compared to treatment administered after bleeding occurred. This favourable effect is due to a consistent reduction in total bleeds and hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints) and leads to a significant improvement in quality of life. Preventative therapy is linked to an increased factor usage and cost of treatment. We found weaker evidence (due to lack of data) to show preventative therapy reduced joint deterioration when treatment is started after joint damage has been established. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventative regimen, i.e. for example starting time, dosage frequency, minimally effective dose."

                "This review assessed if these medications would be useful in patients with diabetes. We included eight trials with 21,379 patients and a mean duration of follow-up ranging from 365 to 913 days. Specific data for patients with diabetes were only available in full for one of these trials and partial data were available for two trials. Analysis of the available data demonstrated that adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, ticlopidine) were not more effective than other blood thinning drugs or placebo for death from any cause, death related to cardiovascular disease, heart attacks or strokes. There was no available information on the effects of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists on health-related quality of life, adverse effects specially for people with diabetes, or costs. The use of adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists in patients with diabetes needs to be guided by the information available from trials which included patients with and without diabetes. All future trials on adenosine-diphosphate receptor antagonists should include data which relate specifically to patients with diabetes in order to inform evidence-based clinical guidelines."

Seven trials evaluated single treatment (One of the radioactive isotopes of technetium, a gamma/beta-emitter with a half life of 6 hours.) sessions, one evaluated a two-week intervention (Of, or related to, anatomic sites that are located in the cranium, brain, and eye.), one evaluated a six-week intervention (Of, or related to, anatomic sites that are located in the cranium, brain, and eye.) and one a three-month intervention (Of, or related to, anatomic sites that are located in the cranium, brain, and eye.). It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory support to the outcome assessors. In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions. The six-week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains. One single intervention (Of, or related to, anatomic sites that are located in the cranium, brain, and eye.) trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Six trials (151 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure. Three trials used nasal masks (Swelling due to an excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain.), one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece (A chromone complex that acts by inhibiting the release of chemical mediators from sensitized mast cells.) and one trial used a face mask (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.) and in one trial it is unclear. Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life). Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis (The continents and countries situated on those continents; the UNITED STATES and each of the constituent states arranged by region; CANADA and each of its provinces; AUSTRALIA and each of its states; the major bodies of water and major islands on both hemispheres; and selected major cities.) may prefer it. We were unable to find any evidence that non-invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters. Three trials (27 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory support compared to oxygen or room air using nasal masks (Swelling due to an excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain.) (two trials) and nasal masks (Swelling due to an excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain.) or full face mask (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.)s (one trial). Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (Irreversible cessation of all bodily functions, manifested by absence of spontaneous breathing and total loss of cardiovascular and cerebral functions.)). Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide (deemed sensitive when the disclosure could impact the privacy, well-being, or safety of that subject, and requires additional protection.Usage Note:If there a jurisdictional, organizational, or individual mandate, then use the applicable ActPrivacyLaw or ActConsentDirective code from the ActCode system to and specify the law in addition to this more generic code.). Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between non-invasive ventilation compared with oxygen or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks. One trial (13 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes. The trial found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation compared to no non-invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes. Three trials reported on adverse effects. One trial, evaluating non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain on respiratory muscle (Presence of fluid in the pleural cavity resulting from excessive transudation or exudation from the pleural surfaces.) testing. One trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure (The occupational discipline of the traditional Chinese methods of ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY for treating disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.). A second trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non-invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax (A system in which medical doctors and other healthcare professionals (such as nurses, pharmacists, and therapists) treat symptoms and diseases using drugs, radiation, or surgery.) when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia (To stop or end, permanently or temporarily.) which resolved (Organizations which provide an environment encouraging social interactions through group activities or individual relationships especially for the purpose of rehabilitating or supporting patients, individuals with common health problems, or the elderly.) when inspiratory positive airway pressure (The occupational discipline of the traditional Chinese methods of ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY for treating disease by inserting needles along specific pathways or meridians.) was decreased. Non-invasive ventilation (The lobe of the right lung that lies above the oblique and horizontal fissures and includes the apical, posterior and anterior bronchopulmonary segments; in the left lung, the lobe lies above the oblique fissure and contains the apicoposterior, anterior, superior lingular and inferior lingular segments.) may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (The continents and countries situated on those continents; the UNITED STATES and each of the constituent states arranged by region; CANADA and each of its provinces; AUSTRALIA and each of its states; the major bodies of water and major islands on both hemispheres; and selected major cities.) who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Non-invasive ventilation (The lobe of the right lung that lies above the oblique and horizontal fissures and includes the apical, posterior and anterior bronchopulmonary segments; in the left lung, the lobe lies above the oblique fissure and contains the apicoposterior, anterior, superior lingular and inferior lingular segments.), used in addition to oxygen, may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen therapy alone in moderate to severe disease. The effect of NIV on exercise is unclear. These benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single treatment (One of the radioactive isotopes of technetium, a gamma/beta-emitter with a half life of 6 hours.) sessions with small numbers of participants. The impact of this therapy on pulmonary exacerbations and disease progression remain unclear. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials which are adequately powered to determine the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation in cystic fibrosis (The continents and countries situated on those continents; the UNITED STATES and each of the constituent states arranged by region; CANADA and each of its provinces; AUSTRALIA and each of its states; the major bodies of water and major islands on both hemispheres; and selected major cities.) airway clearance and exercise.",

                "This review includes 10 trials (191 people with cystic fibrosis) - seven single-treatment sessions and a two-week trial, a six-week trial and a three-month trial. Six single-treatment trials, the two-week trial and the three-month trial compared non-invasive ventilation with other airway clearance techniques. Two single-treatment trials and the six-week trial looked at non-invasive ventilation for overnight breathing support compared to oxygen or normal room air. One single-treatment trial compared non-invasive ventilation with no additional treatment during an exercise test. Single-treatment trials of non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance showed that this may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it to other methods. We could not find evidence that non-invasive ventilation increased the amount of mucus coughed up, but it did improve some measures of lung function, at least in the short term. The two-week trial did not demonstrate clear benefits between groups. The original three-month trial report stated an improvement in lung clearance index. One person in one of these trials reported pain on respiratory muscle testing. The three trials comparing overnight support from non-invasive ventilation measured lung function, quality of life and carbon dioxide levels; they showed it is effective, safe and acceptable. We found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation and oxygen or room air, except for exercise performance which improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air after six weeks. Two trials reported side effects. In the first trial, one person found the mask uncomfortable. In the second trial, one person in the room air group had collapsed lungs and two people could not tolerate increased pressure when breathing in. The trial comparing the effects of non-invasive ventilation to no treatment on exercise capacity found no clear differences between groups. Non-invasive ventilation may help alongside other airway clearance techniques, particularly when people with cystic fibrosis have difficulty coughing up mucus and during sleep. Long-term trials are needed with enough people to show the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation on airway clearance, during sleep and exercise training in severe disease. The benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single-treatment sessions with only small numbers of people. There is limited evidence of some longer-term improvement in lung function in one trial. Our results from the trials of overnight breathing support differed from those in the original analyses, this is likely due to the small numbers of participants and some statistical issues. We judged only the six-week trial to be free from any bias. In the remaining trials, we thought there were low or unclear chances of the results being affected because data were either reported only partially or not at all. We were not sure if the way in which participants were put into the different treatment groups would affect the results of the trials."

We obtained IPD (A device for smoking herbal substances that filters and cools the smoke by passing it through water.) for all participants in all included studies (broken.). The 95% confidence interval (CI) of all outcomes included zero. These included partial pressure of CO2 (Use of antibiotics before, during, or after a diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedure to prevent infectious complications.)

The mean effect on 6MWD was small at 27.7 m and not statistically significant. Given the width of the 95% CI (-28.1 to 66.3 m), the real effect of NIPPV (A therapeutic procedure used in patients with kidney failure.) on 6MWD is uncertain and we cannot exclude an effect that is clinically significant (considering that the minimal clinically difference on 6MWD is around 26 m). Nocturnal-NIPPV (A therapeutic procedure used in patients with kidney failure.) at home for at least three months in hypercapnic patients with stable COPD had no consistent clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, exercise tolerance, HRQoL, lung function, respiratory muscle strength or sleep efficiency.

Five of these studies looked at the effects after using NIPPV compared to regular treatment (without NIPPV) for at least three months. Two studies looked for a longer period of time, for at least 12 months. The mean age of all participants included in our meta-analysis was 67 years. All studies included men and women, but 77% of participants were men. We used data from 245 people for our meta-analysis. NIPPV during the night for 3 and 12 months in people with COPD who had raised levels of carbon dioxide had no clinically or statistically significant effect on gas exchange, six-minute walking distance, health-related quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle strength and sleep efficiency. This means we found little or no difference in the outcomes. Because some trials had very small numbers of participants, our confidence in the quality of evidence is moderate when looking at the effects on gas exchange. All seven trials measured this outcome. Other outcomes were not always measured or available leading to a lower quality of evidence for the other outcomes such as six-minute walking distance, health-related quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle function and sleep efficiency."

            "input": "We included four trials, involving 1190 women. It was not possible to blind women and staff to the intervention, but for other 'Risk of bias' domains these studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to expectant management, there was no clear effect of induction of labour for suspected macrosomia on the risk of caesarean section (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.09; 1190 women; four trials, moderate-quality evidence) or instrumental delivery (A cognitive process involving the formation of ideas generalized from the knowledge of qualities, aspects, and relations of objects.) (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.13; 1190 women; four trials, low-quality evidence). Shoulder dystocia (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.98; 1190 women; four trials, moderate-quality evidence), and fracture (any) (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79; 1190 women; four studies, high-quality evidence) were reduced in the induction of labour group. There were no clear differences between groups for brachial plexus injury (two events were reported in the control group in one trial, low-quality evidence). There was no strong evidence of any difference between groups for measures of neonatal asphyxia; low five-minute infant Apgar scores (less than seven) or low arterial cord blood pH (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 9.02; 858 infants; two trials, low-quality evidence; and, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.22; 818 infants; one trial, moderate-quality evidence, respectively). Mean birthweight was lower in the induction group, but there was considerable heterogeneity between studies for this outcome (mean difference (MD) -178.03 g, 95% CI -315.26 to -40.81; 1190 infants; four studies; I2 = 89%). In one study with data for 818 women, third- and fourth-degree perineal tears were increased in the induction group (RR 3.70, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.17). For outcomes assessed using GRADE, we based our downgrading decisions on high risk of bias from lack of blinding and imprecision of effect estimates. Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia has not been shown to alter the risk of brachial plexus injury, but the power of the included studies to show a difference for such a rare event is limited. Also antenatal estimates of fetal weight are often inaccurate so many women may be worried unnecessarily, and many inductions (The state of being free from intrusion or disturbance in one's private life or affairs.) may not be needed. Nevertheless, induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia results in a lower mean birthweight, and fewer birth fractures and shoulder dystocia (Denotes a person with ancestral origins are in any of the countries of Africa.). The unexpected observation in the induction group of increased perineal damage, and the plausible, but of uncertain significance, observation of increased use of phototherapy, both in the largest trial, should also be kept in mind. Findings from trials included in the review suggest that to prevent (Technique based on muscle relaxation during self-hypnotic exercises.) one fracture it would be necessary to induce labour in 60 women. Since induction of labour does not appear to alter the rate of caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery (A cognitive process involving the formation of ideas generalized from the knowledge of qualities, aspects, and relations of objects.), it is likely to be popular with many women. In settings where obstetricians can be reasonably confident about their scan assessment of fetal weight, the advantages and disadvantages of induction at or near term for fetuses suspected of being macrosomic should be discussed with parents. Although some parents and doctors may feel the evidence already justifies induction, others may justifiably disagree. Further trials of induction shortly before term for suspected fetal macrosomia are needed. Such trials should concentrate (The ratio of interstitial fluid volume to total body fluid.) on refining the optimum gestation of induction, and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of macrosomia.",

                "We found four trials that assessed induction of labour at 37 to 40 weeks for women when it was suspected that their baby was large. A total of 1190 pregnant, non-diabetic women were involved. We searched for evidence on 31 October 2015. The studies were of moderate or good quality although it was not possible to blind the women and staff providing care to which group women had been assigned. This may have introduced bias. The number of births where the baby's shoulder became stuck (shoulder dystocia) or a bone was fractured (usually the clavicle, which heals well without consequences) were reduced in the induction of labour group. The evidence was assessed as moderate quality for shoulder dystocia and high quality for fracture. No clear differences between groups were reported for damage to the network of nerves that send signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm and hand (brachial plexus injury) of the baby (low-quality evidence due to very few events occurring) or signs of not enough oxygen during birth. A policy of labour induction reduced the average birthweight of babies by 178 g. The trials did not show any differences in the number of women who had caesarean sections or instrumental births. There is limited evidence that more women in the induction of labour group had severe damage to the perineum. We conclude that there appear to be benefits, but there may also be some disadvantages of induction of labour shortly before term. The option of having an induction should be discussed with parents when their baby is suspected to be extra large. Although some parents and doctors may feel the existing evidence is sufficient to justify inducing labour, others may disagree. Further high-quality studies are needed in order to find out what is the best time to induce labour towards the end of pregnancy, and how to improve the accuracy in diagnosing macrosomia.

Ninety-four trials reported no mortality, and nine trials reported mortality but did not report in which intervention (Deterioration in memory function.) group the mortality occurred. Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases. Vitamin D (Restoration of an organ or other structure to its original site.) was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Forty-five trials (80%) reported the baseline vitamin D status of participants based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (A transmembrane-protein belonging to the TNF family of intercellular signaling proteins.). Participants in 19 trials had vitamin D adequacy (at or above 20 ng/mL). Participants in the remaining 26 trials had vitamin D insufficiency (less than 20 ng/mL).

More than 8% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality. When different forms of vitamin D were assessed in separate analyses, only vitamin D3 (A repeat operation for the same condition in the same patient due to disease progression or recurrence, or as followup to failed previous surgery.) decreased mortality (4,153/37,817 (11.0%) vs 4,340/38,110 (11.4%); RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98); P = 0.002; I2 = 0%; 75,927 participants; 38 trials). Vitamin D (Restoration of an organ or other structure to its original site.)2, alfacalcidol and calcitriol (The outer margins of the ABDOMEN, extending from the osteocartilaginous thoracic cage to the PELVIS.) did not significantly affect mortality. A subgroup analysis of trials at high risk of bias suggested that vitamin D2 may even increase mortality, but this finding could be due to random errors. Trial sequential analysis supported our finding regarding vitamin D3 (A repeat operation for the same condition in the same patient due to disease progression or recurrence, or as followup to failed previous surgery.), with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent one additional death. We did not observe any statistically significant differences in the effect of vitamin D on mortality in subgroup analyses of trials at low risk of bias compared with trials at high risk of bias; of trials using placebo (The magnitude of something in a particular direction, especially length or width or height.) compared with trials using no intervention (Deterioration in memory function.) in the control group; of trials with no risk of industry bias compared with trials with risk of industry bias; of trials assessing primary prevention (A benign epithelial tumor with a glandular organization.) compared with trials assessing secondary prevention; of trials including participants with vitamin D level below 20 ng/mL at entry compared with trials including participants with vitamin D levels equal to or greater than 20 ng/mL at entry; of trials including ambulatory participants compared with trials including institutionalised participants; of trials using concomitant calcium (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.) supplementation (Code specifying observations related to living situation for a person in a private residence.) compared with trials without calcium (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.); of trials using a dose below 800 IU per day compared with trials using doses above 800 IU per day; and of trials including only women compared with trials including both sexes or only men.

Vitamin D (Restoration of an organ or other structure to its original site.)3 combined with calcium (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.) increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (Increased susceptibility to infections.)

Vitamin D3 also seemed to decrease cancer mortality, showing a reduction in mortality of 4 per 1000 persons treated for five to seven years. We also observed adverse effects to vitamin D such as renal stone formation (seen for vitamin D3 combined with calcium) and elevated blood levels of calcium (seen for both alfacalcidol and calcitriol). In conclusion, we found some evidence that vitamin D3 seems to decrease mortality in elderly people not dependent on help or living in institutional care. A large number of study participants left the trial before completion, and this raises concerns regarding the validity of the results. More randomised clinical trials are needed on the effects of vitamin D3 on mortality in younger, healthy persons, as well as in elderly community-dwelling and institutionalised persons without apparent vitamin D deficiency."

No significant differences favoured VGB or CBZ in terms of time to treatment withdrawal and time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation (Treatment of disease by exposure to light, especially by variously concentrated light rays or specific wavelengths.) from randomisation, but results did show a disadvantage for VGB on time to first seizure (Devices worn in the vagina to provide support to displaced uterus or rectum.) after randomisation. Compared with CBZ, VGB was associated with more occurrences of weight gain and fewer occurrences of skin rash and drowsiness. No differences in visual field defects and visual disturbances were noted. Data are currently insufficient to address the risk-benefit balance of VGB versus CBZ monotherapy for epilepsy (1.). Given the high prevalence of visual field defects reported in an existing systematic review of observational studies (The edges of tissue removed in a surgery for assessment of the effectiveness of a surgical procedure in achieving the local control of a neoplasm and the adequacy of tumor removal.) (Maguire 2010), VGB monotherapy should be prescribed with caution for epilepsy (1.) and should not be considered a first-line choice. If necessary, the visual field should be frequently assessed.

Only seven trials used a quality of life measures and no study looked at economic outcomes. Seven of the trials recruited women with symptoms of incontinence, while the others required women with urodynamic stress incontinence, apart from one where the inclusion criteria were uncertain. This review provides some evidence that weighted vaginal cones are better than no active treatment (A muscarinic antagonist structurally related to ATROPINE but often considered safer and more effective for inhalation use.) in women with SUI and may be of similar effectiveness to PFMT and electrostimulation.

When vaginal weights were compared to other treatments, such as pelvic floor muscle training without the weights, and electrical stimulation of the pelvic floor, no clear differences between the treatments were evident. This may have been because the numbers of participants in the trials were small, and larger numbers may be required for any differences in the effectiveness of treatments to become clear. Some women find vaginal weights unpleasant or difficult to use, so this treatment may not be useful for all women. Many women with stress urinary incontinence will not be cured by these treatments, and so it is important for trials to assess quality of life during and after treatment, but few of these trials did. Most of the trials were of fairly short duration, so it is difficult to say what happens to women with stress urinary incontinence in the longer term."

There were small and positive effects on anxiety and depression in individuals who received education compared to those who received usual care. There were small and negative effects on decision conflict in individuals who received decision aids compared to those who received usual care.

However, cot-nursing with warming of the nursery during week one when compared to incubator care revealed poorer weight gain. The primary outcomes related to temperature control (mean body temperature and episodes of cold stress) indicated on overall analysis no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. Episodes of hyperthermia in the cot-nursing group were reported more frequently in one trial. The secondary outcomes of oxygen consumption, breast feeding at hospital discharge, episodes of nosocomial sepsis, maternal perceptions of infant's condition, maternal stress and anxiety and death prior to hospital discharge revealed there was no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. There was, however, a strong trend towards less death prior to hospital discharge. This was largely related to the results were obtained from the trials undertaken in Turkey and Ethiopia and thus may not be applicable to neonatal nurseries in developed countries.

                "The evidence in this review is up-to-date as of February 2017. Authors with Cochrane Oral Health found three relevant studies, involving 146 participants who had eye teeth displaced in the roof of the mouth, either on one or both sides. The majority of participants were female and the average age in the studies ranged from 14 to 17 years. Two studies were designed in a way that made them likely to be biased. We combined results from three studies and found that one technique did not seem to have an advantage over the other for ensuring the movement of the tooth into the correct position without the need for repeat surgery. Five out of 141 participants analysed were surgical failures, one of which was due to the complication of detachment of the gold chain during surgery. One study reported complications after surgery and found one participant in the closed group had a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and another participant in the closed group experienced pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate. We were unable to combine results from studies for any other outcomes, but individual studies did not show evidence of a difference between the two techniques for pain, discomfort, appearance, gum health, length of treatment time or cost (low to very low quality evidence). Overall, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low, which means we cannot be certain of the findings. It does not seem that one surgical technique is better than the other for moving displaced eye teeth into the correct position, or for other outcomes, but this finding is uncertain because the quality of the evidence is low. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three studies are currently in process. When they are completed, we will include them in an update of this review and may be able to reach firmer conclusions."

Compared with the endoscopic (The removal of fluids or discharges from the body, such as from a wound, sore, or cavity.) group, the surgical group had a higher proportion of participants with pain relief (Conditions or pathological processes associated with pregnancy.), both at middle/long-term follow-up (two to five years: risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 2.15) and long-term follow-up (\u2265 five years, RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.05).

No differences were found in terms of major post-intervention (An abnormal growth in the adrenal gland.)al complications or mortality, although the number of participants did not allow for this to be reliably evaluated. One trial, including 32 participants, compared surgical intervention (An abnormal growth in the adrenal gland.) with conservative treatment (Refers to the physical structures needed to conduct research as well as the basic services needed for support, eg shipping and receiving services, waste management, and utilities.): 17 in the surgical group and 15 in the conservative group.

The trial had methodological limitations, and the number of participants was relatively small. For patients with obstructive chronic pancreatitis (Procedures and programs that facilitate the development or skill acquisition in infants and young children who have disabilities, who are at risk for developing disabilities, or who are gifted.) and dilated pancreatic duct, this review shows that surgery is superior to endoscopy in terms of pain relief (Conditions or pathological processes associated with pregnancy.). Morbidity and mortality seem not to differ between the two intervention (An abnormal growth in the adrenal gland.) modalities, but the small trials identified do not provide sufficient power to detect the small differences expected in this outcome. Regarding the comparison of surgical intervention (An abnormal growth in the adrenal gland.) versus conservative treatment (Refers to the physical structures needed to conduct research as well as the basic services needed for support, eg shipping and receiving services, waste management, and utilities.), this review has shown that surgical intervention (An abnormal growth in the adrenal gland.) in an early stage of chronic pancreatitis is a promising approach in terms of pain relief (Conditions or pathological processes associated with pregnancy.) and pancreatic function.

We found that surgery achieved pain relief in a higher proportion of participants than endoscopy. Surgery also had other advantages like improved quality of life for the first two years after intervention, although this difference disappeared with time. Similarly, surgery reduced the risk of developing malabsorption due to failure of the pancreas, but with longer follow-up this advantage became smaller. The studies seemingly showed no difference between endoscopy and surgery in complications after interventions. We also compared surgery with conservative treatment. The results of one trial suggested that surgery early in the condition achieved better pain relief and preservation of pancreatic function. For endoscopy versus surgery, the quality of the evidence for pain relief, quality of life and pancreatic function was moderate (according to GRADE). For both complications and mortality this was low, since the two trials were too small to make reliable conclusions. The quality of evidence regarding surgery versus conservative treatment was low, since the trial was small, which precluded drawing reliable conclusions regarding all outcomes."

There was little or no difference in number of participants who achieved remission (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45 in favour of monthly dexamethasone (formed as the walls of the bladder converge and become contiguous with the proximal urethra.); moderate-quality evidence), or change in disability or impairment after one year (low-quality evidence). Change of grip strength or Medical Research Council (MRC) scores demonstrated little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality to low-quality evidence). Eight of 16 people in the prednisolone (Surgical removal of the vermiform appendix.) group and seven of 24 people in the dexamethasone (formed as the walls of the bladder converge and become contiguous with the proximal urethra.) group deteriorated. Side effects were similar with each regimen (caused by some previous phenomenon.), except that sleeplessness was less common with monthly dexamethasone (formed as the walls of the bladder converge and become contiguous with the proximal urethra.)

Experience from large non-randomised studies suggests that corticosteroids (Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) are beneficial, but long-term use causes serious side effects. We are very uncertain about the effects of oral prednisone (A hair-containing cyst or sinus, occurring chiefly in the coccygeal region.) compared with no treatment, because the quality of evidence from the only RCT that exists is very low. Nevertheless, corticosteroids (Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) are commonly used in practice, supported by very low-quality evidence from observational studies. We also know from observational studies that corticosteroids (Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) carry the long-term risk of serious side effects. The efficacy of high-dose (administered, generally via injection, over a short period of time.) monthly oral dexamethasone (formed as the walls of the bladder converge and become contiguous with the proximal urethra.) is probably little different from that of daily standard-dose oral prednisolone (Surgical removal of the vermiform appendix.). Most side effects occurred with similar frequencies in both groups, but with high-dose (administered, generally via injection, over a short period of time.) monthly oral dexamethasone (formed as the walls of the bladder converge and become contiguous with the proximal urethra.) moon facies is probably less common and sleeplessness may be less common than with oral prednisolone (Surgical removal of the vermiform appendix.).

A 1982 US study compared daily prednisone tablets for 12 weeks with no treatment. Thirty-five people took part. Fourteen participants received prednisone (10 male and four female, with a median age of 46.5 years) and 14 did not receive prednisone (nine male and five female, with a median age of 50 years). Those taking part and the trialists were aware of which treatment the participants received (i.e. they were not 'blinded'), which carries a risk of bias. The second study compared two six-month corticosteroid treatment regimens: daily standard-dose prednisolone tablets, and high-dose dexamethasone tablets for four days each month. Multiple European centres did the trial, which reported its findings in 2010. Forty-one people took part but one person withdrew after one day because they did not want to continue and the diagnosis was wrong. Of those who continued, 24 (18 men and six women, average age 59.9 years) received monthly dexamethasone and 16 (10 men and six women, average age 60.8 years) received daily prednisolone. There was no commercial support for either study. Funding for both came from an academic centre or charitable funds. Neither included study reported our preferred primary outcome, which was a disability score. After 12 weeks, in the trial of prednisone compared to no treatment, 12 of 19 participants on prednisone improved compared with five of 16 participants not on prednisone, based on measurement of disease severity by neurologists. Thus, improvement was about twice as common with prednisone. The small numbers in the trial and its limitations meant that even with this difference we are very uncertain about the size of any effect of prednisone. The trial authors did not report side effects in detail, but one person who received prednisone died. Corticosteroids are commonly used for CIDP in practice, based on favourable reports from non-randomised studies. Corticosteroids are well known to cause side effects, especially when people take large doses for a long time. In the RCT comparing two corticosteroid regimens, 10 of 24 people on monthly dexamethasone and six of 16 people on daily prednisolone were well and off treatment after a year, which indicates effects that are probably similar. Changes in grip strength and scores of muscle strength were also probably similar between the treatment groups. Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone had similar side effects to one another, except that with high-dose monthly dexamethasone, sleeplessness may be less common and a moon-shaped facial appearance is probably less common. The benefit and harm from prednisone in CIDP is uncertain. The quality of evidence is very low because only one small randomised trial with a high risk of bias is available. Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone may be of similar benefit in CIDP, but monthly dexamethasone may have fewer side effects. The evidence is up to date to 8 November 2016."

We could not say whether more people who had a remote check-up needed oral corticosteroids (A non-Hodgkin lymphoma with an indolent clinical course.) for an asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) exacerbation than those who were seen face-to-face because the confidence intervals (CIs (Spectroscopic method of measuring the magnetic moment of elementary particles such as atomic nuclei, protons or electrons.)) were very wide (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.44; 278 participants; one study; low quality evidence). In the face-to-face check-up groups, 21 participants out of 1000 had exacerbations that required oral steroids over three months, compared to 36 (95% CI nine to 139) out of 1000 for the remote check-up group. Exacerbations that needed treatment in the Emergency Department (ED (A phenylephrine-related beta-1 adrenergic and alpha adrenergic agonist used as a cardiotonic and antihypotensive agent.)), hospital admission or an unscheduled healthcare visit all happened too infrequently to detect whether remote check-ups are a safe alternative to face-to-face consultations. Serious adverse events were not reported separately from the exacerbation outcomes. There was no difference in asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) control measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or in quality of life measured on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) between remote and face-to-face check-ups. We could rule out significant harm of remote check-ups for these outcomes but we were less confident because these outcomes are more prone to bias from lack of blinding. The larger implementation study that compared two general practice populations demonstrated that offering telephone check-ups and proactively phoning participants increased the number of people with asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) who received a review. However, we do not know whether the additional participants who had a telephone check-up subsequently benefited in asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) outcomes. Current randomised evidence does not demonstrate any important differences between face-to-face and remote asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) check-ups in terms of exacerbations, asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) control or quality of life. There is insufficient information to rule out differences in efficacy, or to say whether or not remote asthma (The number of breaths (inhalation and exhalation) taken per minute time.) check-ups are a safe alternative to being seen face-to-face.",

People in the four pooled studies in general took regular medications and we excluded those with severe asthma or other lung diseases. We looked at two other studies with very different designs to the main four separately: one compared a practice where people with asthma were given the option of a telephone check-up or a practice visit where they came to the clinic as usual, and one looked specifically at using technology to monitor people while cutting down their oral steroids dose. We last looked for studies on 24 November 2015. We cannot say whether or not people who had a check-up over the phone or internet were more or less likely to need oral corticosteroids for an asthma attack than those seen face-to-face, and we were uncertain of the result for several reasons. Too few people had asthma attacks that needed treatment in the Emergency Department or hospital, or an unscheduled visit to see their doctor to tell if remote check-ups were as good as face-to-face consultations. There didn't appear to be a difference in asthma control or quality of life, but we were able to rule out the possibility that remote check-ups are not as good as face-to-face consultations on these measures. The evidence was all considered to be of low or moderate quality. The study that tested the possible benefit of giving people the option of a telephone check-up showed that this increased the number of people reviewed, but did not show an overall benefit on asthma outcomes."

All the included studies (Studies comparing two or more treatments or interventions in which the subjects or patients, upon completion of the course of one treatment, are switched to another.) fulfilled at least seven of 10 methodological criteria. The outcome data of the following measures were homogenous and were pooled in a meta-analysis: functional ability (n = 198; WMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08), quality of life (CHQ-PhS: n = 115; WMD -3.96, 95% CI -8.91 to 1.00) and aerobic capacity (n = 124; WMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.19). The results suggest that the outcome measures all favoured the exercise therapy (Surgery performed on the heart.) but none were statistically significant. None of the studies (Studies comparing two or more treatments or interventions in which the subjects or patients, upon completion of the course of one treatment, are switched to another.) reported negative effects of the exercise therapy (Surgery performed on the heart.).

The low number of available RCTs limits the generalisability. The included and excluded studies (Studies comparing two or more treatments or interventions in which the subjects or patients, upon completion of the course of one treatment, are switched to another.) were all consistent about the adverse effects of exercise therapy (Surgery performed on the heart.); no short-term detrimental effects of exercise therapy (Surgery performed on the heart.) were found in any study. Both included and excluded studies (Studies comparing two or more treatments or interventions in which the subjects or patients, upon completion of the course of one treatment, are switched to another.) showed that exercise does not exacerbate arthritis.

This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. No short-term adverse effects of exercise therapy were found in the studies that make up this review. What is exercise therapy and what is JIA? Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children and is an important cause of short-term and long-term disability. In JIA the cause of the arthritis is unknown. It generally begins in children younger than age 16 years. It always lasts for at least six weeks. A physician will rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms before diagnosing JIA. Several types of exercise therapy are described in this review, for example, physical training programs such as strength training for improving muscle strength and endurance exercise for improving overall fitness (either land based or in a pool). Best estimate of what happens to children with JIA and exercise Ability to function: a child's ability to function changed less than 1 more point on a scale of 0 to 3. Other studies state that a change of 0.13 on the score of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) is a clinically important improvement from the perspective of children and their parents. This level of change has not been found in this review Quality of life: a child's quality of life changed between 2.5 and 4 more points on a scale of 1 to 50. There may be little or no difference with exercise. It is possible that these differences are the result of chance. Adverse effects: no short-term effects have been reported after exercise therapy for children with JIA."

                "Evidence gathered for this review is current to September 2018. We found 19 randomised studies that compared antibiotics versus placebo in a total of 2663 COPD patients with a wide range of flare-up severity. Analyses show that currently used antibiotics reduced treatment failures (no improvement in symptoms, despite treatment, within 7 to 28 days, depending on the study) compared with placebo in outpatients with mild to moderate flare-ups, as well as in patients admitted to an intensive care unit for very severe flare-ups with respiratory failure. However, antibiotics did not reduce treatment failures among hospitalised patients with severe flare-ups, although we are less certain about this result because the effect estimate also suggested findings similar to those seen in outpatients, but the confidence interval crossed 1.0. Use of antibiotics led to reduced mortality only in patients admitted to an intensive care unit, but not in patients with mild to moderate (outpatients) or severe (inpatients) flare-ups, although deaths were rare in these latter groups. Antibiotics did not reduce length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients. Patients treated with antibiotics experienced diarrhoea more often than those given placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. Reviewers could not compare the severity of underlying COPD across trials because trial authors inconsistently reported lung function and other parameters. The quality of evidence for review outcomes was low to moderate. Although trial results show that antibiotics were effective across outcomes for patients with very severe flare-ups and respiratory failure who needed treatment in an intensive care unit, researchers report inconsistent effects in patients with mild to severe flare-ups. Future high-quality studies should examine clinical signs or blood tests at the time of presentation that are useful for identifying patients who can benefit from antibiotic therapy."

Four trials compared PFMT as a treatment for prolapse against a control group (n = 857 women); two trials included women having surgery for prolapse and compared PFMT as an adjunct to surgery versus surgery alone (n = 118 women). PFMT versus control There was a significant risk of bias in two out four trials in this comparison. Prolapse (unknown, that born without signs of life at the time of delivery, and with an Apgar score of zero at both one and five minutes.) symptoms and women's reports of treatment outcomes (primary outcomes) were measured differently in the three trials where this was reported: all three indicated greater improvement in symptoms in the PFMT group compared to the control group. Pooling data on severity of prolapse from two trials indicated that PFMT increases the chance of an improvement in prolapse stage (A loosely defined grouping of drugs that have effects on psychological function.) by 17% compared to no PFMT. The two trials which measured pelvic floor muscle function found better function (or improvement in function) in the PFMT group compared to the control group; measurements were not known to be blinded. Two out of three trials which measured urinary outcomes (urodynamics, frequency and bother of symptoms, or symptom score (Immunoglobulin molecules having a specific amino acid sequence by virtue of which they interact only with the ANTIGEN (or a very similar shape) that induced their synthesis in cells of the lymphoid series (especially PLASMA CELLS).)) reported differences between groups in favour of the PFMT group. One trial reported bowel outcomes, showing less frequency and bother with symptoms in the PFMT group compared to the control group. PFMT supplementing surgery versus surgery alone Both trials were small and neither measured prolapse-specific outcomes. Pelvic floor (A synthetic analogue of the endogenous hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), with potential antineoplastic activity.) muscle function findings differed between the trials: one found no difference between trial groups in muscle strength, whilst the other found a benefit for the PFMT group in terms of stronger muscles. Similarly findings relating to urinary outcomes were contradictory: one trial found no difference in symptom score (Immunoglobulin molecules having a specific amino acid sequence by virtue of which they interact only with the ANTIGEN (or a very similar shape) that induced their synthesis in cells of the lymphoid series (especially PLASMA CELLS).) change between groups, whilst the other found more improvement in urinary symptoms (A method, developed by Dr. Virginia Apgar, to evaluate a newborn's adjustment to extrauterine life.) and a reduction in diurnal frequency in the PFMT group compared to the control group. There is now some evidence available indicating a positive effect of PFMT for prolapse symptoms and severity. The largest most rigorous trial to date suggests that six months of supervised PFMT has benefits in terms of anatomical and symptom improvement (if symptomatic) immediately post-intervention. Further evidence relating to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PFMT, of different intensities, for symptomatic prolapse in the medium and long term is needed. A large trial of PFMT supplementing surgery is needed to give clear evidence about the usefulness of combining these treatments (Impaired ability to eat related to problems gathering food and getting ready to suck, chew, or swallow it.). Other comparisons which have not been addressed in trials to date and warrant consideration include those involving lifestyle change interventions, and trials aimed at prolapse prevention.",

                "Six trials were included. Four trials compared pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with no intervention, and two trials compared pelvic floor muscle training plus surgery to surgery alone. PFMT compared to no intervention was found in individual trials to improve prolapse symptoms, but data could not be combined. Data on prolapse severity was combined from two trials and results indicated that PFMT increases the chance of improvement in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no treatment. Pelvic floor muscle function appeared to be improved in women who received PFMT in the two trials which measured this. Bladder symptoms were improved with PFMT in two out of three trials measuring this; bowel symptoms were measured in one trial, and an improvement with PFMT was found. The two trials which looked at the benefit of PFMT in addition to surgery, were small but of good quality. Findings were contradictory: women benefited from PFMT, in terms of urinary symptoms and pelvic floor muscle strength, in one trial but not the other. The evidence from the trials suggests there is some benefit from conservative treatment of prolapse, specifically for PFMT as compared to no intervention. More randomised controlled trials are still needed to look at different regimens of PFMT, the cost in relation to benefit, and the long-term effects. The combination of PFMT and surgery requires to be evaluated in a large randomised trial. There is a dearth of trials addressing lifestyle changes as a treatment for prolapse, and trials aimed at prevention of prolapse. Trials of one type of conservative intervention versus another, and combinations of conservative interventions, are also lacking."

Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) differentiated schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity (Quotient of quantities of the same kind for different components within the same system.) of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%), and a specificity of 81.4% (74% to 87.1%) In seven studies, FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) differentiated schizophrenia from non-psychotic mental health disorders (An indication that a study participant has removed itself from the study.) with a sensitivity (Quotient of quantities of the same kind for different components within the same system.) of 61.8% (51.7% to 71%) and a specificity of 94.1% (88% to 97.2%). In sixteen studies, FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) differentiated schizophrenia from other types of psychosis (This gene plays a role in the regulation of transcription of steroid processing genes.) with a sensitivity (Quotient of quantities of the same kind for different components within the same system.) of 58% (50.3% to 65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%). The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) correctly identifies people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time. The use of FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will incorrectly diagnose around five to 19 people in every 100 who have FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) as having schizophrenia and specialists will not agree with this diagnosis (A heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the blood vessel walls.). These people will still merit specialist assessment and help due to the severity of disturbance in their behaviour and mental state. Again, with a sensitivity (Quotient of quantities of the same kind for different components within the same system.) of FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) of 60%, reliance on FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will not correctly diagnose around 40% of people that specialists will consider to have schizophrenia. Some of these people may experience a delay in getting appropriate treatment. Others, whom specialists will consider to have schizophrenia, could be prematurely discharged from care, if triage relies on the presence of FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) to diagnose schizophrenia. Empathetic, considerate use of FRS (Malignant neoplasms involving the ductal systems of any of a number of organs, such as the MAMMARY GLANDS, the PANCREAS, the PROSTATE, or the LACRIMAL GLAND.) as a diagnostic (Perceptible especially by the eye; open to easy view.) aid - with known limitations - should avoid a good proportion of these errors.

We found 21 studies, with 6253 participants, that looked at how good FRS are at diagnosing schizophrenia when compared to a diagnosis made by a psychiatrist. These studies showed that for people who actually have schizophrenia, FRS would only correctly diagnose just over half of them as schizophrenic. For people who do not have schizophrenia, almost 20% would be incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Therefore, if a person is experiencing a FRS, schizophrenia is a possible diagnosis, but there is also a chance that it is another mental health disorder. We do not recommend that FRS alone can be used to diagnose schizophrenia. However, FRS could be useful to triage patients who need to be assessed by a psychiatrist."

There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.)s and 44 participants in the 1 psychological study. Some included studies (Increased chance of taking one's life intentionally) had methodological weaknesses (Neural blockade of the sympathetic nerve roots.); for example, we judged four studies (Increased chance of taking one's life intentionally) to have high risk of detection bias, attrition bias, or other bias. Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (The 1st letter of the Greek alphabet.))), and improvement in sleep and quality of life. No study reported participant-rated global assessment or improvement of sleep. The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) groups. It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group education sessions. Statistically significant improvements in objective severity using the SCORAD clinical tool were recorded for all intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) groups when compared with controls. Improvements in objective severity (intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) minus no intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.)) by age group were as follows: age 3 months to 7 years = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.8; age 8 to 12 years = 6.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 11.2; and age 13 to 18 years = 9.9, 95% CI 4.3 to 15.5.

However, in all of the above studies (Increased chance of taking one's life intentionally), the confidence interval limits do not exceed the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD. The largest study measured quality of life using the German 'Quality of life in parents of children with atopic dermatitis' (A sensation of discomfort emanating from the inferior quadrants of the abdomen, which may be peritoneal or visceral in origin, or referred from an extra-abdominal location.) questionnaire, a validated tool with five subscales. Parents of children under seven years had significantly better improvements in the intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) group on all five subscales. Parents of children aged 8 to 12 years experienced significantly better improvements in the intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) group on 3 of the 5 subscales.

Few use an explicit theoretical base, and the components of each intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) are not sufficiently well described to allow replication. A relative lack of rigorously designed trials provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of educational and psychological intervention (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.)s in helping to manage the condition (A conference between two or more people to consider a particular question; the act of deliberating together; confering with another researcher, physician, or expert about an issue or a case.) of atopic eczema (A characteristic symptom complex.) in children.

Details of the interventions used and the educational theory base are generally poorly described. Outcome measures varied between studies.

In particular, two studies showed promise. One large study (n = 992) using a multi-disciplinary group education intervention in a hospital setting showed modest improvements in disease severity and quality of life. The single study using psychological approaches indicated that relaxation methods reduced the severity of eczema when compared to discussion only. There is a need for further research into this subject, and priority should be given to comparing the relative cost effectiveness of health professionals educating parents either in teams or by nurses alone.

The use of blunt needles (The complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.) will thus prevent (usually regular and done with the intention of improving or maintaining PHYSICAL FITNESS or HEALTH.) one glove perforation in every six operation (Synthetic or natural substances which are given to prevent a disease or disorder or are used in the process of treating a disease or injury due to a poisonous agent.)s. In four studies, the use of blunt needles (The complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.) reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries with a RR of 0.31 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.68). Because the force needed for the blunt needles (The complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.) is higher, their use was rated as more difficult but still acceptable in five out of six studies. The quality of the evidence was rated as high. There is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles (The complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a fetus, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.) appreciably reduces the risk of exposure to blood and bodily fluids for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operation (Synthetic or natural substances which are given to prevent a disease or disorder or are used in the process of treating a disease or injury due to a poisonous agent.)s.

                "We reviewed the literature to evaluate the preventive effect of blunt needles compared to sharp needles on needle stick injuries among surgical staff. We searched multiple medical databases (to May 2011). We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of blunt versus sharp suture needles for preventing needle stick injuries among surgical staff. We located 10 RCTs with 2961 operations in which blunt needles were compared to sharp needles. Six studies focused on abdominal operations, two on vaginal repair and two on hip replacement. On average, a surgeon that used sharp needles sustained one glove perforation per three operations. The use of blunt needles reduced the risk of glove perforations by 54% (95% confidence interval 46% to 62%) compared to sharp needles. The use of blunt needles in six operations will thus prevent one glove perforation. In four studies the use of blunt needles also reduced the number of self-reported needle stick injuries by 69% (95% confidence interval 14% to 68%). Even though surgeons reported that the force needed for the blunt needles was higher, their use of the needles was still rated as acceptable in five out of six studies. We concluded that there is high quality evidence that the use of blunt needles appreciably reduces the risk of contracting infectious diseases for surgeons and their assistants over a range of operations by reducing the number of needle stick injuries. It is unlikely that future research will change this conclusion."

                "Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low-potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high-potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side-effects. The classification into high-potency and low-potency medication means that low-potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side-effects that are common to most high-potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low-potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high-potency drugs with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high-potency antipsychotic) with low-potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low-potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine.\u00a0The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people.\u00a0It compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality.\u00a0Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low-potency antipsychotics.\u00a0However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things.\u00a0They differ slightly in their side-effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low-potency antipsychotics was found.\u00a0Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution.

The authors reported a statistically significant increase in clinical activity in the arm that was incentivised with a fee-for-service payment.

One trial did not contribute data. The overall risk of bias was unclear in half of the studies. No clear differences were seen for development of pregnancy hypertension or pre-eclampsia. The 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily represented by trials of women with low incomes. In some trials all women were also given iron, folate or vitamins or combinations of these. UNICEF is already promoting antenatal use of multiple-micronutrient supplementation, including zinc, to all pregnant women in developing countries. Finding ways to improve women's overall nutritional status, particularly in low-income areas, will do more to improve the health of mothers and babies than supplementing pregnant women with zinc alone.

Three studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) were conducted in the USA, one study in the UK and one study in Japan. A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.). The majority of participants in four of these trials were people with proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) diabetic retinopathy; one trial recruited mainly people with non-proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) retinopathy. Four of the studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) evaluated panretinal photocoagulation with argon laser and one study investigated selective photocoagulation of non-perfusion areas. Three studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) compared laser treatment to no treatment and two studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) compared laser treatment to deferred laser treatment.

Three studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) were considered to be at risk of attrition bias. At 12 months there was little difference between eyes that received laser photocoagulation (a tubular flexible device used for temporary or prolonged drainage of the biliary tract, for splinting of the bile duct during healing, or for preventing stricture of the bile duct.) and those allocated to no treatment (or deferred treatment), in terms of loss of 15 or more letters of visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.11; 8926 eyes; 2 RCTs, low quality evidence). Longer term follow-up did not show a consistent pattern, but one study found a 20% reduction in risk of loss of 15 or more letters of visual acuity at five years with laser treatment. Treatment with laser reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86; 9276 eyes; 4 RCTs, moderate quality evidence). There was a beneficial effect on progression (A genus of gram-positive, coccoid bacteria whose organisms occur in pairs or chains.) of diabetic retinopathy with treated eyes experiencing a 50% reduction in risk of progression (A genus of gram-positive, coccoid bacteria whose organisms occur in pairs or chains.) of diabetic retinopathy (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.64; 8331 eyes; 4 RCTs, low quality evidence) and a similar reduction in risk of vitreous haemorrhage (Purine or pyrimidine bases attached to a ribose or deoxyribose.) (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.85; 224 eyes; 2 RCTs, low quality evidence). None of the studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) reported near visual acuity or patient-relevant outcomes such as quality of life, pain, loss of driving licence or adverse effects such as retinal detachment. We did not plan any subgroup analyses, but there was a difference in baseline (A scalar measure of the rate of movement of the object expressed either as the distance travelled divided by the time taken (average speed) or the rate of change of position with respect to time at a particular point (instantaneous speed).) risk in participants with non-proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) retinopathy compared to those with proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) retinopathy. With the small number of included studies (Modified by personal feeling or bias.) we could not do a formal subgroup analysis (Space of compartment of trunk bounded by the upper and lower surfaces of two consecutive ribs.) comparing effect in proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) and non-proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) retinopathy. This review provides evidence that laser photocoagulation (a tubular flexible device used for temporary or prolonged drainage of the biliary tract, for splinting of the bile duct during healing, or for preventing stricture of the bile duct.) is beneficial in treating proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) diabetic retinopathy. We judged the evidence to be moderate or low, depending on the outcome. This is partly related to reporting of trials conducted many years ago, after which panretinal photocoagulation has become the mainstay of treatment of proliferative (Critical and exhaustive investigation or experimentation, having for its aim the discovery of new facts and their correct interpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, theories, or laws in the light of newly discovered facts, or the practical application of such new or revised conclusions, theories, or laws.) diabetic retinopathy. Future Cochrane Reviews on variations in the laser treatment protocol (Evaluation undertaken to assess the results or consequences of management and procedures used in combating disease in order to determine the efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and practicability of these interventions in individual cases or series.) are planned. Future research on laser photocoagulation (a tubular flexible device used for temporary or prolonged drainage of the biliary tract, for splinting of the bile duct during healing, or for preventing stricture of the bile duct.) should investigate the combination of laser photocoagulation (a tubular flexible device used for temporary or prolonged drainage of the biliary tract, for splinting of the bile duct during healing, or for preventing stricture of the bile duct.) with newer treatments (Conditions characterized by disturbances of usual sleep patterns or behaviors.) such as anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs).",

A total of 4786 people (9503 eyes) were included in these studies. Most participants had PDR. We found that moderate vision loss at 12 months was similar in eyes treated with laser and eyes that were not treated, but similar assessments made at a later date showed that eyes treated with laser were less likely to have suffered moderate vision loss. Treatment with laser reduced the risk of severe visual loss by over 50% at 12 months. There was a similar effect on the progression of DR. None of the studies reported patient-relevant outcomes such as pain or loss of driving licence. We did not find very many studies and those we found were done quite a long time ago when standards of trial conduct and reporting were lower. We judged the quality of the evidence to be low, with the exception of the results for severe visual loss, which we judged to be moderate quality evidence."

                "We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings."

The MD for AQLQ score exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 0.5, but whether the mean changes exceeded the MCID for asthma (A series of steps taken in order to conduct research.) symptoms is uncertain due to the lack of an established MCID in the severity scores used in the included studies.

A further two trials compared MTX with combined immunosuppressive therapy (MTX with anti-T lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) (an agent that destroys white blood cells) and MTX with azathioprine). In these two trials, participants and investigators knew which treatment participants were receiving, which could have biased the results. For our primary outcome, which was muscle strength, we were only able to combine the results for the two trials of IFN beta-1a therapy versus placebo. This treatment did not appear to offer a benefit in terms of muscle strength. MTX also did not stop or retard loss of muscle strength when compared to placebo. We considered the evidence from these trials to be of moderate quality because the trials were too small to rule out a possible benefit for these drugs. For the other trials, the evidence was of very low quality. Three trials compared IVIg (combined in one trial with prednisone) to a placebo, but we were unable to perform meta-analysis because the available data were not suitable. One trial of ATG combined with MTX versus MTX alone provided very low-quality evidence of an effect on muscle strength in favour of MTX plus ATG at 12 months. The other comparisons, of MTX versus placebo, oxandrolone versus placebo, azathioprine combined with MTX versus MTX, and arimoclomol versus placebo were reported in single trials that did not provide enough data for analysis of the effect on muscle strength. Due to their small size and short duration, the trials we studied were generally unable to give definitive answers as to whether the treatments tested were effective or ineffective. All of the interventions we studied had some adverse effects and are known to cause potentially serious adverse events. We need larger trials of longer duration, using robust ways of measuring the effects of treatments that are meaningful to people with IBM.

The daily cost of outpatient therapy was less with oral linezolid than with intravenous vancomycin, although for inpatient treatment, linezolid was more expensive than vancomycin. Well-designed trials will be required in future to confirm these results, as the trials from which these conclusions were drawn were of poor methodological quality, at high risk of bias, and were funded by the pharmaceutical company that makes linezolid."

The authors found six eligible trials involving 1862 patients. The results indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers. The authors conclude that there is some evidence that a calcium channel blocker called nimodipine may be beneficial for some patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, there is also an indication of certain adverse reactions amongst patients treated with nimodipine which may mean that the drug is harmful for some individuals. The authors recommend that the promising results in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage are replicated in a larger well designed trial, before any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the drug can be drawn.

All three trials examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis within the femoropopliteal arteries. These trials were carried out in Germany and Austria and used paclitaxel as the agent in the drug-eluting balloons. Two of the three trials were industry sponsored. Two companies manufactured the drug-eluting balloons (Eurocor, Bonn, Germany; Medtronic, Fridley, Minnesota, USA). The trials examined both anatomical and clinical endpoints. We noted heterogeneity in the frequency of bailout stenting deployment between studies (Diseases which have one or more of the following characteristics: they are permanent, leave residual disability, are caused by nonreversible pathological alteration, require special training of the patient for rehabilitation, or may be expected to require a long period of supervision, observation, or care.) as well as in the dosage of paclitaxel applied by the DEBs. Using GRADE assessment criteria, we determined that the certainty of evidence presented was very low for the outcomes of amputation (To increase in length or duration.), target lesion revascularization, binary restenosis (traditionally above the eyebrows.), death, and improvement of one or more Rutherford categories. Most participants were followed up to 12 months, but one trial followed participants for up to 24 months. Trial results show no difference in the incidence of amputation (To increase in length or duration.) between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty. DEBs showed better outcomes for up to 24 months for target lesion revascularization (odds ratio (OR) 0.05, 95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.92 at six months; OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.70 at 24 months) and at six and 12 months for binary restenosis (traditionally above the eyebrows.)

Data show no clear differences in death between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty. Data were insufficient for subgroup or sensitivity analyses to be conducted.

Most study participants were followed for six or more months; this is called \"follow-up.\" Results showed that DEBs were not better for participants than uncoated balloon angioplasty with regard to the need for amputation. At 24 months of follow-up, DEBs were associated with fewer target lesion revascularizations, which refers to the need to perform a procedure on a stent that had already been treated with a DEB or an uncoated balloon angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. DEBs were also found to have better binary restenosis rates, which refers to the percentage of treated stents that develop new stenosis after they have been treated with a DEB or an uncoated balloon angioplasty. Finally, more people who were treated with DEBs described improvement in their leg symptoms, as measured by a change in their Rutherford category. DEBs were not found to be better for participants than uncoated balloon angioplasty with regard to patient death. The certainty of the evidence presented was very low because we identified only three studies with small numbers of participants, and because many participants in those studies were lost to follow-up.

Evidence was moderate for duration of clinical symptoms (Use or hold jointly or in common.)

Evidence was moderate for length of hospital stay as only one study recorded this outcome. This means that we are reasonably confident that the true effect is close to that estimated in this work. Moderate-quality evidence shows that use of steroid (Also known as articulations, these are points of connection between the ends of certain separate bones, or where the borders of other bones are juxtaposed.)s in the acute phase of KD can be associated with improved coronary artery abnormalities, shorter duration of hospital stay and a decreased duration of clinical symptoms (Use or hold jointly or in common.).

None of the remaining meta-analyses of PIP versus alternative treatment for primary outcomes (i.e. adverse effects), or secondary outcomes showed differences in outcome or any adverse changes. We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. For all comparisons, we rated the evidence as low or very low quality for parental depression (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) and secure (Tongues of skin and subcutaneous tissue, sometimes including muscle, cut away from the underlying parts but often still attached at one end.) or disorganised infant attachment. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was because there was risk of bias in the study design or execution of the trial. The included studies (Drug treatment to prevent, stop, or reduce the severity of seizures or convulsions, commonly used in cases of epilepsy or other seizure disorders.) also involved relatively few participants and wide CI values (imprecision), and, in some cases, we detected clinical and statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes. Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship-based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors (Rendering pathogens harmless through the use of heat, antiseptics, antibacterial agents, etc.) such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction.",

                "We searched electronic databases and identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs, where participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) and one cluster randomised trial (where prisons rather than participants were used as the unit of randomisation), in which participants had been allocated to a receive PIP versus a control group, and which reported results using at least one standard measure of outcome (i.e. an instrument which has been tested to ensure that it reliably measures the outcome under investigation). Evidence is current to 13 January 2014. We identified eight studies with 846 randomised participants comparing either PIP with a no-treatment control group (four studies) or comparing PIP with other types of treatment (four studies). The studies comparing PIP with a no-treatment control group contributed data to 19 meta-analyses of the primary outcomes of parental mental health (depression), parent-infant interaction outcomes of maternal sensitivity (i.e. the extent to which the caregiver responds in a timely and attuned manner), child involvement and parent positive engagement, and infant outcomes of infant attachment category (the infant's ability to seek and maintain closeness to primary caregiver - infant attachment is classified as follows: 'secure' infant attachment is a positive outcome, which indicates that the infant is able to be comforted when distressed and is able to use the parent as a secure base from which to explore the environment. Infants who are insecurely attached are either 'avoidant' (i.e. appear not to need comforting when they are distressed and attempt to manage the distress themselves); or 'resistant' (i.e. unable to be comforted when distressed and alternate between resistance and anger). Children who are defined as \u2018disorganised\u2019 are unable to produce a coherent strategy in the face of distress and produce behaviour that is a mixture of approach and avoidance to the caregiver); and the secondary outcomes of infant behaviour and infant cognitive development (i.e. intellectual development, including thinking, problem solving and communicating). In our analyses, parents who received PIP were more likely to have an infant who was securely emotionally attached to the parent after the intervention; this a favourable outcome but there is very low quality evidence to support it. The studies comparing PIP with another model of treatment contributed data to 15 meta-analysis assessments of primary outcomes, including parental mental health, parent-infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment and infant behaviour, or secondary infant outcomes such as infant cognitive development. None of these comparisons showed differences that favoured either PIP or the alternative intervention. None of the comparisons of PIP with either a control or comparison treatment group showed adverse changes for any outcome. We conclude that although PIP appears to be a promising method of improving infant attachment security, there is no evidence about its benefits in terms of other outcomes, and no evidence to show that it is more effective than other types of treatment for parents and infants. Further research is needed. The included studies were unclear about important quality criteria, had limitations in terms of their design or methods, or we judged that there was risk of bias in the trial. This lower quality evidence gives us less confidence in the observed effects."

Overall, the results of this updated review reach the same conclusions as the original published review. None of the 11 included trials reported maternal desaturation. No differences were noted in routine measures of foetal wellbeing (Apgar scores) when mothers who received extra oxygen were compared with those who did not. The pregnant women receiving extra oxygen in comparison with room air had significantly higher oxygen saturation (three trials) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (five trials), as well as a significantly higher partial pressure of oxygen in both the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein (eight and 11 trials, respectively). Two trials reported higher markers of free radicals (perhaps indicating stress from excess oxygen) in mothers and foetuses when extra oxygen was given, but this is of no clinical significance Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving oxygen in this situation is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus. None of the 11 studies focused on maternal changes in oxygen saturation (defined as maternal saturation less than 90%). We graded the quality of evidence as low for the primary outcome (Apgar scores), and very low for the secondary outcomes (maternal oxygen saturation; partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein). The reasons for our grading were risk of bias and inconsistency of the results."

The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence of renal dysfunction included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing (Retrograde flow of gastric juice (GASTRIC ACID) and/or duodenal contents (BILE ACIDS; PANCREATIC JUICE) into the distal ESOPHAGUS, commonly due to incompetence of the LOWER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCTER.). The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies (Surgical removal of part or all of the duodenum.), received treatments, reported outcome measures, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (The insertion of drugs into the vagina to treat local infections, neoplasms, or to induce labor.), which ranged from 2.4% to 32%. Of these 52 studies, 36 studied a decreased (estimated) GFR (An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the knee.), including at least 432 CCS, and found it was present in 0% to 73.7% of participants. One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides (A hazy area of increased attenuation in centrilobular areas of the lung with preserved bronchial and vascular markings seen on a computer tomography scan.) and vancomycin (Description:An ACT that organizes a set of component acts into a semantic grouping that have a shared subject.) in CCS receiving total body irradiation (Fermented juice of fresh grapes or of other fruit or plant products used as a beverage.)

Four non-eligible studies assessing a total cohort of CCS, found nephrectomy (Performing or possessing executive duties; acting as a supervisor or manager.) and (high-dose (HD)) ifosfamide as risk factors for decreased GFR (An unpleasant sensation characterized by physical discomfort (such as pricking, throbbing, or aching) localized to the knee.). The majority also reported cisplatin (Inability to control the flow of urine from the bladder (urinary incontinence) or the escape of stool from the rectum (fecal incontinence).) as a risk factor. In addition, two non-eligible studies showed an association of a longer follow-up period with glomerular dysfunction. Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, studied proteinuria, which was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants.

However, studies were contradictory and incomparable. Eleven out of 52 studies assessed hypophosphataemia or tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR), or both. Prevalence ranged between 0% and 36.8% for hypophosphataemia in 287 participants, and from 0% to 62.5% for impaired TPR in 246 participants. One non-eligible study investigated risk factors for hypophosphataemia, but could not find any association. Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, assessed the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia, which ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%. Both non-eligible studies investigating risk factors identified cisplatin (Inability to control the flow of urine from the bladder (urinary incontinence) or the escape of stool from the rectum (fecal incontinence).) as a risk factor. Carboplatin (Persons functioning as natural, adoptive, or substitute parents.), nephrectomy (Performing or possessing executive duties; acting as a supervisor or manager.) and follow-up time were other reported risk factors. The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies). Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and abdominal radiotherapy. A non-eligible study also found long follow-up time as risk factor. Three non-eligible studies showed that a higher body mass index increased the risk of hypertension. Treatment-related risk factors were abdominal radiotherapy and TBI (Replacement of the knee joint.), but studies were inconsistent. Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. Risk of bias was present in all studies. The prevalence of adverse renal effects after treatment with cisplatin (Inability to control the flow of urine from the bladder (urinary incontinence) or the escape of stool from the rectum (fecal incontinence).), carboplatin, ifosfamide, radiation therapy involving the kidney region, nephrectomy (Performing or possessing executive duties; acting as a supervisor or manager.), or any combination of these, ranged from 0% to 84% depending on the study population, received treatment combination, reported outcome measure, follow-up duration and methodological quality. With currently available evidence, it was not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the prevalence of, and treatment-related risk factors for, specific adverse renal effects. Future studies should focus on adequate study designs and reporting, including large prospective cohort studies with adequate control groups when possible. In addition, these studies should deploy multivariable risk factor analyses to correct for possible confounding. Next to research concerning known nephrotoxic therapies, exploring nephrotoxicity after new therapeutic agents is advised for future studies.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease ranged from 2.4% to 32% in 244 participants (7/52 studies).

An abnormal GFR was found to be present in 0% to 73.7% of participants. One eligible study found an increased risk of abnormal GFR in participants who had been treated with total body irradiation (TBI) and received certain types of antibiotics (aminoglycosides and vancomycin). Four non-eligible studies reported an increased risk of abnormal GFR for participants treated with surgery of the kidney and ifosfamide. Some studies also reported that cisplatin and long follow-up duration were risk factors. Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, assessed an abnormal amount of proteins in the urine, which they found in 3.5% to 84% of participants. Risk factors, evaluated by three non-eligible studies, included cisplatin, ifosfamide, TBI, and a combination of surgery and radiation involving the kidney. However, the results of these studies did not agree, and we could not analyse their results together because they used different definitions. Eleven out of 52 studies looked at a low level of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphataemia), or problems with the reabsorption of phosphate by the kidneys in 246 participants. Prevalence of hypophosphataemia ranged between 0% and 36.8% in 287 participants. The studies found problems with the reabsorption of phosphate by the kidneys in 0% to 62.5% of participants. One non-eligible study investigated risk factors, but could not find any association with hypophosphataemia. Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, evaluated a low level of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesaemia). Prevalence ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%. Two non-eligible studies identified cisplatin as risk factor for hypomagnesaemia. Other reported risk factors were carboplatin, surgery of the kidney, and follow-up time. However, studies were contradictory. The prevalence of high blood pressure ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies). Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and radiation involving the kidney. A high body mass index was reported as a risk factor by three non-eligible studies. Other reported risk factors included follow-up time, and radiation involving the kidney or TBI. However, studies were contradictory. All studies showed problems that could affect our confidence in their results.

The study design of the third trial was more complex. Participants with early-stage HL were divided into those with a favourable or unfavourable prognosis. They were then randomised to receive PET-adapted or standard treatment. Following a PET scan, participants were further divided into PET-positive and PET-negative groups (The larger air passages of the lungs arising from the terminal bifurcation of the TRACHEA.). To date, data have been published for the PET-negative arms only, making it possible to perform a meta-analysis including all three trials. Of the 1999 participants included in the three trials only 1480 were analysed. The 519 excluded participants were either PET-positive, or were excluded because they did not match the inclusion criteria. One study reported no deaths. The other two studies (Inflammation of the coverings of the brain and/or spinal cord, which consist of the PIA MATER; ARACHNOID; and DURA MATER.) reported two deaths in participants receiving PET-adapted therapy and two in participants receiving standard therapy (very-low-quality evidence). Progression-free survival was shorter in participants with PET-adapted therapy (without radiotherapy) than in those receiving standard treatment with radiotherapy (HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.50; P value < 0.0001). This difference was also apparent in comparisons of participants receiving no additional radiotherapy (PET-adapted therapy) versus radiotherapy (standard therapy) (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.23; P value = 0.03) and in those receiving chemotherapy but no radiotherapy (PET-adapted therapy) versus standard radiotherapy (HR 3.00; 95% CI 1.75 to 5.14; P value < 0.0001) (moderate-quality evidence). Short-term AEs only were assessed in one trial, which showed no evidence of a difference between the treatment arms (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.53; P value = 0.72) (very-low-quality evidence). No data on long-term AEs were reported in any of the trials. To date, no robust data on OS, response rate, TRM, QoL (Persistent abnormal dilatation of the bronchi.), or short- and long-term AEs are available. However, this systematic review found moderate-quality evidence that PFS was shorter in individuals with early-stage HL and a negative PET scan receiving chemotherapy only (PET-adapted therapy) than in those receiving additional radiotherapy (standard therapy). More RCTs with longer follow ups (The larger air passages of the lungs arising from the terminal bifurcation of the TRACHEA.) may lead to more precise results for AEs, TRM and QoL (Persistent abnormal dilatation of the bronchi.), and could evaluate whether this PFS advantage will translate into an overall survival benefit. It is still uncertain whether PET-positive individuals benefit from PET-based treatment adaptation and the effect of such an approach in those with advanced HL.",

                "We searched important medical databases such as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE. Two review authors independently screened, summarised and analysed the results. This lead to the inclusion of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1999 participants. Currently, only data for 1480 of these participants have been published and were included in this systematic review. Participants were randomised to receive either standard therapy (chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy) or PET-adapted therapy (chemotherapy only). The median age of participants was 32 years and 52% were male. The evidence provided is current to September 2014. We are unable to draw conclusions about the effect of PET-adapted therapy on OS as there was insufficient data available (4 deaths in 1480 participants). However, PFS was shorter following PET-adapted therapy than with standard treatment. Based on our data, we can assume that of 1000 individuals receiving PET-adapted treatment over 4 years, 222 individuals would experience disease progression or death compared with 100 of 1000 individuals receiving standard treatment. Only one trial reported on short-term adverse events and the findings were uncertain and do not provide reliable evidence. The studies did not provide any information on the outcomes of QoL, response to therapy or treatment-related mortality. We judged the quality of evidence for the outcomes of OS and adverse events as very low. We considered the quality of evidence for PFS to be moderate. To date, no robust data on OS are available. This systematic review shows that individuals with early-stage HL have a shorter PFS after PET-adapted therapy compared with those who receive standard therapy. More RCTs with longer follow ups may lead to more information on adverse events, treatment-related mortality and QoL, and could evaluate whether the PFS advantage seen with standard therapy will translate into a benefit in terms of OS."

Twenty-one trials compared combined oral contraceptives (COCs); others examined different COC regimens, progestin-only pills, injectables (A spectrum of congenital, inherited, or acquired abnormalities in BLOOD VESSELS that can adversely affect the normal blood flow in ARTERIES or VEINS.), a vaginal ring (Existing conditions, especially those that would be confused with the phenomenon to be observed or measured.), and implants (Used with articles which include video files or clips, or for articles which are entirely video.). None included a placebo (A course of study offered by an educational institution.). Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome. Twelve trials studied desogestrel-containing COCs, and the few differences from levonorgestrel COCs were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of two studies showed the desogestrel group had a higher mean fasting glucose (a new strategy being implemented by the National Cancer Institute to expose minorities to cancer research at the high school and undergraduate levels.) (MD 0.20; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.41). Where data could not be combined, single studies showed lower mean fasting glucose (a new strategy being implemented by the National Cancer Institute to expose minorities to cancer research at the high school and undergraduate levels.) (MD -0.40; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.08) and higher means for two-hour glucose response (MD 1.08; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.71) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (MD 20.30; 95% CI 4.24 to 36.36). Three trials examined the etonogestrel vaginal ring (Existing conditions, especially those that would be confused with the phenomenon to be observed or measured.) (The determination of oxygen-hemoglobin saturation of blood either by withdrawing a sample and passing it through a classical photoelectric oximeter or by electrodes attached to some translucent part of the body like finger, earlobe, or skin fold.) and one examined an etonogestrel implant. One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin than the levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38). Of eight trials of norethisterone preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables (A spectrum of congenital, inherited, or acquired abnormalities in BLOOD VESSELS that can adversely affect the normal blood flow in ARTERIES or VEINS.). In a COC trial, a norethisterone group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a levonorgestrel-COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study (Organic substances that are required in small amounts for maintenance and growth, but which cannot be manufactured by the human body.), a group using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate had higher means than the group using norethisterone enanthate for fasting glucose (a new strategy being implemented by the National Cancer Institute to expose minorities to cancer research at the high school and undergraduate levels.) (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (MD 3.40; 95% CI 2.07 to 4.73). Among five recent trials, two examined newer COCs with different estrogen types. One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17\u03b2-estradiol (A condition caused by one or more episodes of DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS, usually the blood clots are lodged in the legs.) had lower means than the levonorgestrel group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c (The region of the lower limb between the FOOT and the LEG.)) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two levonorgestrel COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (a new strategy being implemented by the National Cancer Institute to expose minorities to cancer research at the high school and undergraduate levels.) (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese and normal weight women did not differ significantly. Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives in women without diabetes (Not whole; lacking some necessary part or detail; unfinished.). We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives. Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods. We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (Programmable electronic devices designed to accept data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the results of these operations.)

                "In April 2014, we looked for randomized trials of how the body handles carbohydrates when using birth control methods with hormones. Outcomes were blood glucose or insulin levels. Birth control methods could contain estrogen and progestin or just progestin. The type could be pills, shots (injections), implants (matchstick-size rods put under the skin), the vaginal ring, or an intrauterine device (IUD). The studies had to compare two types of birth control or one type versus a placebo or 'dummy' method. We included 31 trials. None had a placebo. Of 34 pairs of birth control methods compared, eight showed some difference by study groups. Twelve trials studied pills with desogestrel. The few differences were not consistent. Three trials looked at the etonogestrel ring. One showed the ring group had lower insulin than the pill group. Eight trials looked at the progestin norethisterone. A group using norethisterone pills had less glucose change than those taking other pills. In another study, a group using the injectable \u2018depo\u2019 (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) had higher glucose and insulin than the group using another injectable. Of five new trials, two used different estrogen types. In one study, a group taking a pill with ethinyl valerate had lower glucose than a group taking a standard pill. Two other trials compared taking pills for several cycles without stopping (extended use) versus usual use. In one using a dienogest pill, the extended-use group had more glucose change. A small trial used two levonorgestrel pills, and looked at obese and normal weight women. The outcomes did not differ much between those groups. In women without diabetes, hormone contraceptives have little effect on the body's carbohydrate use. Few studies compared the same types of birth control. Therefore, we cannot make strong statements. Many trials had small numbers of women, and many women dropped out. Older trials often did not report all the study methods. Many trials did not include overweight women."

However, the results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias as none of the RCTs were able to blind participants to treatment allocation and, while most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self reported. One of the 10 RCTs was only reported as a conference abstract and did not provide sufficient data for the evaluation of bias risk. High-quality evidence from nine trials (549 participants) indicated that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to -0.20) and improved physical function (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.05) immediately after treatment. Pain and physical function were estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (To adjust, or change.) (0 was no pain or loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 11 points; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and improved physical function by an equivalent of 7 points (95% CI 1 to 12 points; NNTB 6). Only three small studies (183 participants) evaluated quality of life, with overall low quality evidence, with no benefit of exercise demonstrated (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.36). Quality of life was estimated to be 50 points on a norm-based mean (standard deviation (SD)) score of 50 (10) in the general population in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by 0 points. Moderate-quality evidence from seven trials (715 participants) indicated an increased likelihood of withdrawal from the exercise allocation (event rate 6%) compared with the control group (event rate 3%), but this difference was not significant (risk difference 1%; 95% CI -1% to 4%). Of the five studies reporting adverse events (Items gathered and assembled in some order to facilitate access or use.), each study reported only one or two events and all were related to increased pain attributed to the exercise programme. The reduction in pain was sustained at least three to six months after ceasing monitored treatment (five RCTs, 391 participants): pain (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.18). Pain was estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (To adjust, or change.) (0 was no pain) in the control group, the improvement in pain translated to a sustained reduction in pain intensity of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 12 points) compared with the control group (0 to 100 scale (To adjust, or change.)). The improvement in physical function was also sustained (five RCTs, 367 participants): physical function (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.16). Physical function was estimated to be 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (To adjust, or change.) (0 was no loss of physical function) in the control group, the improvement translated to a mean of 7 points (95% CI 4 to 13) compared with the control group. Only five of the 10 RCTs exclusively recruited people with symptomatic hip (A humanized monoclonal antibody against the ERBB-2 RECEPTOR (HER2).) OA (419 participants). There was no significant difference in pain or physical function outcomes compared with five studies recruiting participants with hip (A humanized monoclonal antibody against the ERBB-2 RECEPTOR (HER2).) or knee OA (130 participants). Pooling the results of these 10 RCTs demonstrated that land-based therapeutic (The specialty or practice of nursing in the care of patients in the recovery room following surgery and/or anesthesia.) exercise programmes can reduce pain and improve physical function among people with symptomatic hip (A humanized monoclonal antibody against the ERBB-2 RECEPTOR (HER2).)

After searching for all relevant studies up to February 2013, we included five new studies since the last version of the review, giving 10 studies (549 participants) with mostly mild-to-moderate symptomatic hip OA, alone or with knee OA. Except for one study where participants enrolled in a tai chi programme, all other participants underwent land-based exercise programmes consisting of traditional muscle strengthening, functional training and aerobic fitness programmes, either individually supervised or as part of a group, compared with people who did not exercise. Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain): - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain to be 8 points lower (4 to 11 points lower) at end of treatment (8% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise. - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain as 21 points. - People who did not exercise rated their pain as 29 points. Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower score means better physical function): - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function to be 7 points lower (1 to 12 points lower) at end of treatment (7% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise. - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function as 22 points. - People who did not exercise rated their physical function as 29 points. Quality of life (higher score means better quality of life): - Overall, people with hip OA participating in the studies had a similar quality of life compared with the general population (normative scores of average 50 points), and quality of life was not further improved by participation in an exercise programme: 0 points higher. - People who completed an exercise programme rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale. - People who did not exercise rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale. Withdrawals - three more people out of 100 dropped out of the exercise programme (1% absolute increase). - Six out of 100 people in exercise programmes dropped out. - Three out of 100 people who did not exercise dropped out. This review showed that there is high-quality evidence that in people with hip OA, exercise reduced pain slightly and improved physical function slightly. Further research is unlikely to change the estimate of these results. Low-quality evidence indicated that exercise may not improve quality of life. Further research is likely to change the estimate of these results. Moderate-quality evidence showed that exercise probably does not increase study drop-outs. Further research may change the estimate. We do not have precise information about side effects such as injuries or falls during exercise, but we would expect these to be rare, and no injuries were reported in the studies."

In March 2017, we found three studies with 122 participants. All compared paracetamol plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone. The studies were small, and were of poor quality. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were not reported. We found no evidence that taking paracetamol alone made any difference to the level of pain experienced. We found no evidence that taking paracetamol together with a morphine-like drug was better than the morphine-like drug alone. Paracetamol did not appear to improve quality of life. No conclusions could be reached about side effects. The amount of information and the differences in how studies were reported meant that no conclusions could be made. The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of paracetamol for treating cancer pain.

For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement' astemizole and diphenhydramine (A subtype of MICROSCOPIC COLITIS, characterized by chronic watery DIARRHEA of unknown origin, a normal COLONOSCOPY but abnormal histopathology on BIOPSY.) were more effective than placebo (astemizole: n=97, 2 RCTs, RR 0.61 CI 0.47 to 0.81 NNT 3 CI 2 to 5; diphenhydramine (A subtype of MICROSCOPIC COLITIS, characterized by chronic watery DIARRHEA of unknown origin, a normal COLONOSCOPY but abnormal histopathology on BIOPSY.): n=131, 2 RCTs, RR 0.43 CI 0.31 to 0.58, NNT 2 CI 1.5 to 2.5), but the doses of astemizole used were those that can cause toxicity.

One trial assessed quality of life, finding no differences between groups. For all predetermined secondary outcomes, such as forced expiratory volume, forced vital capacity (Delivery of the FETUS and PLACENTA under the care of an obstetrician or a health worker.) and peak flow pooling was not possible.

Follow-up ranged from no follow-up to six months.

Three trials investigated expiratory muscle training with a threshold device, and one trial investigated breathing exercises. We found benefits with inspiratory muscle training for improving predicted maximal inspiratory pressure, but not for improving measured maximal inspiratory pressure. We did not find any effects for maximal expiratory pressure. Only one study measured quality of life, but it did not find any effects; two trials measured fatigue and also failed to find a difference between the treatment and control groups. Eighteen participants (\u02dc 10%) dropped out, and no trials reported any serious adverse events. The six trials that were eligible for inclusion in this review were small, so statistical power was low, making analyses less precise. In addition, studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of respiratory muscle training, dosing/intensity, and the severity of MS. In addition, we could not analyze the effects of training on, for example, cough efficacy, pneumonia, and quality of life, as the included trials did not report on these outcomes even though they are important for patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. Altogether, this review provides low-quality evidence that resistive inspiratory muscle training improves predicted inspiratory muscle strength in people with MS. We did not find any effects for resistive expiratory muscle training. More high-quality research in respiratory muscle training in MS is needed."

While sensitivity (Process by which organic tissue becomes hardened by the physiologic deposit of calcium salts.) analysis showed altered results with regards to failure rates, the data available from the Javadi 2010 study alone had a very wide 95% CI, suggesting an imprecise estimate. Therefore, even after removal (A term that refers to the nature and/or clinical outcome of a disease (e.g., acute or chronic disease, aggressive or indolent disease, recurrent disease, etc.) of the Razmju 2011 data, it is still difficult to draw conclusions regarding superiority of one technique over another with regards to graft (Works about comparative studies to verify the effectiveness of diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic drugs, devices, or techniques determined in phase II studies.) failure (A group of four powerful muscles in the front of the thigh.).

Other adverse events, of varying severity, were reported in both intervention (able to move from the airspace of the lungs into the blood.) groups with similar frequency. For both types of surgery, these included postoperative astigmatism, steroid (A lack of occurrence or performance.) induced ocular hypertension (An acute systemic febrile infection caused by SALMONELLA TYPHI, a serotype of SALMONELLA ENTERICA.) and persistent epithelial defects.

We also found no evidence of a difference in outcomes with regards to graft (Works about comparative studies to verify the effectiveness of diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic drugs, devices, or techniques determined in phase II studies.) survival, final UCVA or keratometric outcomes.

The evidence is current to October 2013. The results suggested that graft rejection is more likely to occur following penetrating keratoplasty, however likelihood of graft failure was similar in both groups, as were visual and structural results. DALK was unable to be completed as planned in four cases and in a further three cases complications during dissection required further intervention. Other adverse events, of varying severity, were reported in both intervention groups. For both types of surgery, these included postoperative astigmatism (when the cornea is no longer perfectly curved), raised pressure in the eye following steroid use, and a failure of the epithelium, the front layer of the eye, to heal properly. In recipients of DALK, one participant had interface neovascularisation (a growth of blood vessels where the host and donor cornea come together) and one had wrinkling of Descemet's membrane, a structural element of the cornea.

Only 10 studies were considered at low overall risk of bias, with most studies presenting insufficient details about trial quality.

Iron supplementation improved maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and appears to reduce symptomatic fatigue.

We identified 67 trials recruiting 8506 women eligible for inclusion in the review. Most trials lasted between one and three months. The most commonly used iron form was ferrous sulphate. We found evidence that iron supplements reduce the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, and raise levels of haemoglobin in the blood and in iron stores. Iron supplementation clearly increases the risk of side effects, for example, constipation and abdominal pain. We found high quality evidence that iron improves haemoglobin and produces changes in bowel function, but moderate quality evidence that iron reduces the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency. Evidence of the effects of iron on other outcomes, such as abdominal pain, is of low quality. There are no data on the effects of iron on mortality in this population group. Further definitive studies are needed to identify whether taking iron supplements orally for at least five days a week has an impact on key, health-related outcomes."

The search in January 2016 resulted in an additional ongoing trial, the results of which have not been incorporated in this review. This review compared IRI and fluoropyrimidine with IRI alone in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, toxicity, response rates and quality of life. There is no evidence to suggest any superiority of the combination of IRI and fluoropyrimidine over IRI alone, but our results on overall survival are limited by the number of studies available to date. Longer progression-free survival was seen from adding fluoropyrimidines to IRI. Based on current evidence, both the combination regimens and IRI alone seem equally effective for treating advanced or metastatic patients. Patients in the intervention arm were less likely to develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and grade 1 or 2 alopecia, and more likely to have grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, compared to patients receiving IRI alone. There was moderate quality evidence from these studies suggesting longer progression-free survival from adding fluoropyrimidines to IRI.

Nevertheless a trend was seen toward less analgesic requirement, less effect on pulmonary function and lower wound dehiscence and incisional hernia rates with a transverse incision.

The effect sizes for pain and disability were low in terms of clinical meaningfulness, whereas effects for work-related outcomes were in the moderate range. However, when comparing MBR to other treatments (i.e. brief intervention (Those individuals engaged in research.) with features from a light mobilization program and a graded activity program, functional restoration, brief clinical intervention (Those individuals engaged in research.) including education and advice on exercise, and psychological counselling), we found no differences between the groups in terms of pain (two studies (Administration of a drug within the eye.) with 336 participants; SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), functional disability (two studies (Administration of a drug within the eye.) with 345 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.18, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), and time away from work (two studies (Administration of a drug within the eye.) with 158 participants; SMD -0.25 95% CI -0.98 to 0.47, very low-quality evidence due to serious imprecision, inconsistency and risk of bias).

On average, people with subacute LBP who receive MBR will do better than if they receive usual care, but it is not clear whether they do better than people who receive some other type of treatment.

The authors had no concerns about funding sources of any included studies. Overall, we found that multidisciplinary treatments may be better than usual care for people with LBP for a duration of six to 12 weeks. Individuals receiving multidisciplinary treatment had less pain, less disability, increased likelihood of return-to-work and fewer sick leave days at 12-month follow-up. However, when comparing multidisciplinary treatments to other treatments (e.g. brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise), we found that multidisciplinary treatments may be no better than other treatments. Although we examined adverse events as a secondary outcome, none of the included studies reported this outcome. The quality of the evidence for this review was generally low to very low. This was mainly due to small sample sizes and other study limitations. Moreover, we grouped together studies with differing interventions and comparisons. For example, some of the multidisciplinary interventions were quite intense (e.g. > 30 hours of treatment), whereas others were designed to be brief (e.g. < three hours). This variability across studies makes it more challenging to interpret the findings.

Of these, five RCTs involving 1093 patients were included; four trials in previously untreated patients and one trial in relapsed patients. Overall, the quality of the five trials is judged to be moderate. All trials were reported as randomised and judged to be open-label studies, because usually trials evaluating stem cell transplantation (used as a PROBIOTIC, such as in the treatment of DIARRHEA and PSEUDOMEMBRANOUS ENTEROCOLITIS associated with CLOSTRIDIUM INFECTIONS.) are not blinded. Due to the small number of studies in each analysis (four or less), the quantification of heterogeneity was not reliable and not evaluated in further detail. A potential source of bias are uncertainties in the HR calculation. For OS, the HR had to be calculated for three trials from survival curves, for PFS for two trials.

However, this effect is not transferred into a statistically significant OS advantage (HR = 0.97; 95% 0.76 to 1.24; P = 0.81). The subgroup of trials adding rituximab to both intervention arms (one trial) confirms these results and the trial had to be stopped early after an interim analysis due to a statistically significant PFS advantage in the HDT + ASCT (excised by a cutting or rotating catheter.) arm (PFS: HR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; OS: HR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92). In the four trials in previously untreated patients there are no statistically significant differences between HDT + ASCT (excised by a cutting or rotating catheter.) and the control-arm in terms of TRM (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 0.25 to 6.61; P = 0.77), secondary acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (RR = 2.87; 95% CI 0.7 to 11.75; P = 0.14) or solid cancers (The white liquid secreted by the mammary glands.)

Adverse events (A condition characterized by an abnormal increase of BILIRUBIN in the blood, which may result in JAUNDICE.) were rarely reported and were observed more frequently in patients undergoing HDT + ASCT (excised by a cutting or rotating catheter.) (mostly infections and haematological toxicity). For patients with relapsed FL, there is some evidence (one trial, N = 70) that HDT + ASCT (excised by a cutting or rotating catheter.) is advantageous in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; OS: HR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.89). For this trial, no results were reported for TRM, adverse events (To determine the number or amount of something; the result of this activity.) or secondary cancers. In summary, the currently available evidence suggests a strong PFS benefit for HDT + ASCT (excised by a cutting or rotating catheter.) compared with chemotherapy (Total pharmaceutical services provided by qualified PHARMACISTS.) or immuno-chemotherapy (Total pharmaceutical services provided by qualified PHARMACISTS.) (A speech pattern characterized by abnormally reduced or lacking variability of the pitch of the voice.) in previously untreated patients with FL.

These effects are confirmed in a subgroup analysis (one trial) adding rituximab to both treatment arms. Further trials evaluating this approach are needed to determine this effect more precisely in the era of rituximab. Moreover, longer follow-up data are necessary to find out whether the PFS advantage will translate into an OS advantage in previously untreated patients with FL.

We included five trials with 1093 patients in the main analyses. As a result, the meta-analyses for previously untreated patients (four trials) show no statistical significant differences in terms of survival, treatment-related mortality or secondary malignancies between the patients treated with high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and those treated with chemotherapy only. However, progression-free survival (tumour control), was significantly improved by the high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Adverse events are more common in patients treated with high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. There is an advantage of the high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation for patients with a relapse of the disease, both in survival and in tumour control (one trial). No data on adverse events are reported in this trial."

There was a high risk of performance bias within the trials but overall, risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias was low or unclear. Data showed WDD improved the short-term global state of participants compared with placebo (a mixture of violet rosanilinis with antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties.) or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73, low-quality evidence). When WDD was compared with antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.) drugs (Catheters that are inserted into a large central vein such as a SUBCLAVIAN VEIN or FEMORAL VEIN.), such as chlorpromazine (A polysaccharide-producing species of STREPTOCOCCUS isolated from human dental plaque.) or risperidone (An increased proportion of eosinophils in sputum in the differentiated cell count.), no difference in short-term global state of participants was observed (2 RCTs n = 140, RR 1.18 95% CI 0.98 to 1.43, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (total endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): 2 RCTs, n = 140, MD 0.84, 95% CI -4.17 to 5.84, low-quality evidence). However, WDD was associated with fewer people experiencing extrapyramidal effects (Glucose in blood.) (EPS (An object designed to fill a hole tightly; anything that resembles such an object in appearance or origin.)) compared with other treatments (The dipropionate ester of a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.) (2 RCTs 0/70 versus 47/70, n = 140, RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15, moderate-quality evidence). WDD is often used as an add-on intervention alongside antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.)s (A type of safety study that assesses the degree to which overt adverse effects can be tolerated by the subject.). When WDD + antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.) was compared to antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.) alone, the combination group had better global state (short-term results, 6 RCTs, n = 684, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (short-term total endpoint PANSS: 5 RCTs, n = 580, MD -11.64, 95% CI -13.33 to - 9.94, low-quality evidence), fewer people with EPS (An object designed to fill a hole tightly; anything that resembles such an object in appearance or origin.) (2 RCTs n = 308, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.70, moderate-quality evidence) and reduction of the mean use of risperidone (An increased proportion of eosinophils in sputum in the differentiated cell count.) (1 RCT n = 107, MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.53, low-quality evidence). But, there was no effect on weight gain (1 RCT n = 108, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24, low-quality evidence). When WDD + low-dose antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.) was compared with normal-dose antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.) alone, the combination again showed benefits for short-term global state (7 RCTs n = 522, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93, moderate-quality evidence), mental state (total endpoint PANSS: 4 RCTs n = 250, MD -9.53, 95% CI -17.82 to -1.24, low-quality evidence), and fewer participants with EPS (An object designed to fill a hole tightly; anything that resembles such an object in appearance or origin.) (3 RCTS n = 280, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.51, moderate-quality evidence). Across all comparisons, we found no data on outcomes directly reporting quality of life, hospital service use and economics. Limited evidence suggests that WDD may have some positive short-term antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.) global effects compared to placebo (a mixture of violet rosanilinis with antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties.) or no treatment. However when WDD was compared with other antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.)s (A type of safety study that assesses the degree to which overt adverse effects can be tolerated by the subject.) there was no effect on global or mental state, but WDD was associated with fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic (Lipid infiltration of the hepatic parenchymal cells resulting in a yellow-colored liver.), positive effects were found for global and mental state and the combination caused fewer adverse effects. The available evidence is not high quality.

We screened all records found in this search and included those that met our inclusion criteria and reported useful data. Fifteen trials (with a total of 1437 participants) provided useable, but limited, data. Results showed that WDD may have some beneficial effects on short-term global outcomes and mental state of people with schizophrenia compared to placebo or no treatment but did not show a benefit when compared to antipsychotics - although WDD did cause fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic, there were observed benefits for WDD on improving global state and reducing the side effects caused by antipsychotics. Results of this review suggest WDD may be helpful for people with schizophrenia, but these results are based on low to moderate evidence and there is not enough high-quality evidence to make firm conclusions. Better-designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia."

None of the studies (A position on a scale measuring intensity, quality, or amount.) reported the adverse outcome of root resorption (A medicine or device that can be bought without a doctor's order or prescription.). The review assessed six comparisons. 1. Multistrand stainless steel (The persistence to perform a learned behavior (facts or experiences) after an interval has elapsed in which there has been no performance or practice of the behavior.) versus superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) arch wires. There were five studies (A position on a scale measuring intensity, quality, or amount.) in this group and it was appropriate to undertake a meta-analysis of two of them.

Moderate-quality evidence shows that arch wires of coaxial superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) can produce greater tooth movement over 12 weeks than arch wires made of single-strand superelastic NiTi. Moderate-quality evidence also suggests there may be no difference in pain (The smallest lobe of the right lung, situated above the oblique fissure and below the horizontal fissure.) at day 1 between multistrand stainless steel (The persistence to perform a learned behavior (facts or experiences) after an interval has elapsed in which there has been no performance or practice of the behavior.) arch wires and superelastic NiTi arch wires.

We were interested in 'randomised controlled trials' (RCTs), which are studies in which participants are assigned randomly to the interventions being compared. We found 12 RCTs with 799 participants, all of whom had upper or lower full arch fixed braces, or both. The studies evaluated different initial arch wires, but they were poorly conducted or reported, or both, and their results are likely to be biased. The studies varied in a number of other aspects of orthodontic treatment, compared different types of initial arch wires and reported different outcomes at different times. None of the studies reported both potential benefits (straightening) and harms (pain or side effects such as tooth root shortening). We found moderate-quality evidence that coaxial superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) can produce greater tooth movement over 12 weeks than single-strand superelastic NiTi. We found moderate-quality evidence that there is no difference in pain at day 1 between multistrand stainless steel versus superelastic NiTi arch wires. There is insufficient evidence from our included studies to know if any other particular initial arch wire material is better or worse than another, or if they function equally well, with regard to speed of straightening, pain or tooth shortening in people undergoing orthodontic treatment. There was moderate-quality evidence that coaxial superelastic NiTi can produce greater tooth movement than single-strand superelastic NiTi, and that there is no real difference in pain whether whether arch wires are made with multistrand stainless steel or superelastic NiTi. The quality of the evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was low or very low. Overall, the evidence about initial arch wires in orthodontic treatment is very limited, with comparisons often assessed by one small study with problems in its design. The findings are imprecise and unreliable so more research is needed."

For the CMAI, the study reports a Global score (29 items rated on a seven-point scale (1 = never occurs to 7 = occurs several times an hour) and summed to give a total score ranging from 29 to 203) and mean scores (evaluable items (rated on the same 7-point scale) divided by the theoretical total number of items) for the following four domains: Physically Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as pacing (13 items); Verbally Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as repetition (four items); Physically Aggressive Behaviour, such as hitting (nine items); and Verbally Aggressive Behaviour, such as swearing (three items).

There were no differences in NPI (A self-test that measures depressive feelings and behaviors within the general population.) or OS change scores between groups by the end of the study.

The study did not assess areas important to us, such as the number of injuries sustained by staff or residents. It did, however, measure the impact of staff training on residents' level of aggression three months after the end of the training. Some measures of physical and verbal aggression showed reductions, but not all.

Application of leave-on products (moisturisers, skin protectant (New, damaging blood vessels that grow beneath the retina.)s, or a combination) and avoiding soap seems to be more effective than withholding these products. The performance of leave-on products depends on the combination of ingredients, the overall formulation and the usage (e.g. amount applied).

The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antivirals (clinically significant based on judgment.) in the included studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.) were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir. Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months. The diagnosis (Something regarded as a normative example.) of IM was based on clinical symptoms (Syndromes which feature DYSKINESIAS as a cardinal manifestation of the disease process.) and laboratory parameters. The risk of bias for all included studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.) was either unclear or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution. There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes. These improvements may be of limited clinical significance.

Prospective studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.) indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result. Trial results for the outcome 'adverse event (In humans, one of the paired regions in the anterior portion of the THORAX.)s and side effects of medication (The feeling of being pleased and content.)' were reported narratively in only five studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.). In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event (In humans, one of the paired regions in the anterior portion of the THORAX.) was related to medication (The feeling of being pleased and content.) or complication (Constructions built to access underground water.) of disease. These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups. There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy (Difficult or labored breathing.)' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.), 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group. In terms of viral shedding (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.), the overall effect from six studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.) was that viral shedding (An inhibitor of ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASES that retards the digestion and absorption of DIETARY CARBOHYDRATES in the SMALL INTESTINE.) was suppressed while on antiviral treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped. For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral treatment and control groups. The effectiveness of antiviral agents (acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir) in acute IM is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is very low. The majority of included studies (A disorder of sexual development transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.) were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention. Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful. Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse event (In humans, one of the paired regions in the anterior portion of the THORAX.)s and possible associated costs, and antiviral resistance.

Three different antiviral drugs were studied: acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir, as well as dosage, comparison treatment (fake or no treatment), and how long people were treated and followed up. One study did not report study funding, but the other six studies appeared to have some industry support. None declared conflicts of interest, but one included two authors from a drug company. We wanted to investigate several outcomes: time to recovery; medication side effects; duration of: fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged spleen and liver; development of glandular fever complications; how long it took to eliminate the virus from the throat; health-related quality of life; days off school or work; and economic outcomes. We found improvements in participants who received antiviral for two outcomes. There was an improvement of five days in time taken to recover among people who received antiviral treatment, but this result was not very precise, and the way it was measured was not clearly defined. Other studies show that glandular fever symptoms can take a month or more to get better, and tiredness may occur in about one in every 10 of patients six months later. This improvement may be of limited clinical significance. Most studies that examined adverse effects did not find any differences between people who received antivirals and those who did not. Time taken to resolve lymph node swelling improved to nine days when antivirals were used. However, studies that reported on this, measured lymph node swelling in different ways so we cannot be sure about the accuracy of the result. Evidence quality was rated as very low for all results, which means that we cannot know the exact effect of using antivirals for glandular fever.

Our analysis of these intermediate term trials comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine showed that these two insulins were equally effective in achieving and maintaining glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)). There were no differences in overall, nocturnal and severe hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Insulin detemir was associated with significantly less weight gain (one study showing a difference of 0.9 kg). Treatment with insulin glargine resulted in a lower daily basal insulin dose and a lower number of injection site reactions (1.8% of patients treated with insulin detemir compared to 0.4% of patients treated with insulin glargine had injection side reactions). There was no difference in the variability of fasting glucose levels or the variability of glucose values of 24-hour profiles between the two treatment groups. From the retrieved trials it was not possible to draw conclusions on the effects of these two insulins on quality of life, their costs or on the number of fatalities. Only one trial reported results on health-related quality of life and showed no significant differences between treatment groups. Our analyses suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in the efficacy or the safety between the use of insulin detemir and insulin glargine for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, to achieve the same glycaemic control insulin detemir was often injected twice-daily in a higher dose but with less weight gain, while insulin glargine was only injected once-daily, with somewhat fewer injection site reactions."

In the parallel group trial conducted by Tjandra, 53 participants with severe FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence (Necrosis of the myocardium, as a result of interruption of the blood supply to the area.) (Doughnut-shaped object or surface generated by rotating a circle around an axis that does not intersect the circle; any object that resembles a ring.) compared to the control group who received optimal medical therapy (mean difference (MD) \u22125.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22129.15 to \u22121.25 at 3 months; MD \u22126.30, 95% CI \u221210.34 to \u22122.26 at 12 months). Adverse events (Refers to muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other supporting tissue of the body.) were reported in a proportion of participants: pain at implant site (6%), seroma (2%) and excessive tingling in the vaginal region (9%). In the parallel group trial carried out by Thin, 15 participants with FI in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of FI compared with the percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (A device designed to facilitate the movement of a fluid.) (PTNS) group (MD \u22123.00, 95% CI \u22126.61 to 0.61 at 3 months; MD \u22123.20, 95% CI \u22127.14 to 0.74 at 12 months). Adverse events (Refers to muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other supporting tissue of the body.) were reported in three participants: mild ipsilateral leg pain during temporary testing (n = 1); and stimulator (A work that reports on the results of a clinical study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions so that researchers can evaluate the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes.)-site pain following insertion of neurostimulator (A work that reports on the results of a clinical study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions so that researchers can evaluate the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes.) (n = 2). In the crossover trial by Leroi 7 of 34 recruited participants were excluded from the crossover due mainly to complications or immediate device failure. Twenty-four of the remaining 27 participants while still blinded chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the 'on' and five who preferred the 'off' period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of faecal incontinence (Necrosis of the myocardium, as a result of interruption of the blood supply to the area.) (Doughnut-shaped object or surface generated by rotating a circle around an axis that does not intersect the circle; any object that resembles a ring.) per week fell from 1.7 (0 to 9) during the 'off' period to 0.7 (0 to 5) during the 'on' period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0 to 11) during the 'off' period compared with 3.7 (0 to 11) during the 'on' period. Four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event (The level of health of the individual, group, or population as subjectively assessed by the individual or by more objective measures.) resulting in removal (The part of a human or animal body connecting the HEAD to the rest of the body.) of the stimulator (A work that reports on the results of a clinical study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions so that researchers can evaluate the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes.). In the crossover trial by S\u00f8rensen and colleagues, participants did not experience any FI episodes in either the one-week \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 periods. In the crossover trial by Vaizey, participants reported an average of six, and one, episodes of faecal incontinence (Necrosis of the myocardium, as a result of interruption of the blood supply to the area.) (Doughnut-shaped object or surface generated by rotating a circle around an axis that does not intersect the circle; any object that resembles a ring.) per week during the 'off' and 'on' periods respectively in two participants with FI. Neither study reported adverse event (The level of health of the individual, group, or population as subjectively assessed by the individual or by more objective measures.)s (Invertebrates or non-human vertebrates which transmit infective organisms from one host to another.). In the crossover trial by Kahlke, 14 participants with FI experienced significantly lower episodes of FI per week during the stimulator (A work that reports on the results of a clinical study in which participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions so that researchers can evaluate the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes.) 'on' (1 (SD, 1.7)) compared with the 'off' period (8.4 (SD, 8.7)).

Two trials assessed SNS for constipation. In the Kenefick trial, the two participants experienced an average of two bowel (A generic self-report tool developed to measure, describe, and evaluate changes in the level of daily life activities and performance in children aged 5-15 years.) movements per week during the 'off' crossover period, compared with five during the 'on' period. Abdominal pain (A radiographic procedure using the emission of x-rays to form an image of the structure penetrated by the radiation.) and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the 'off' period compared with 33% during the 'on' period. No adverse event (The level of health of the individual, group, or population as subjectively assessed by the individual or by more objective measures.)s (A pathologic process consisting in the formation of pus.) (Invertebrates or non-human vertebrates which transmit infective organisms from one host to another.) occurred. In contrast, in the trial by Dinning with 59 participants, SNS did not improve frequency of bowel (A generic self-report tool developed to measure, describe, and evaluate changes in the level of daily life activities and performance in children aged 5-15 years.) movements and 73 adverse event (The level of health of the individual, group, or population as subjectively assessed by the individual or by more objective measures.)s (Invertebrates or non-human vertebrates which transmit infective organisms from one host to another.) were reported, which included pain at site of the implanted pulse generator (32), wound infection (12), and urological (17) events. The limited evidence from the included trials suggests that SNS can improve continence (Necrosis of the myocardium, as a result of interruption of the blood supply to the area.) in a proportion of patients with faecal incontinence (Necrosis of the myocardium, as a result of interruption of the blood supply to the area.) (Doughnut-shaped object or surface generated by rotating a circle around an axis that does not intersect the circle; any object that resembles a ring.).

In addition, adverse event (The level of health of the individual, group, or population as subjectively assessed by the individual or by more objective measures.)s (Invertebrates or non-human vertebrates which transmit infective organisms from one host to another.) occurred in some patients where these were reported.

                "This review evaluated the published evidence for the use of SNS for patients with faecal incontinence or constipation from six trials of SNS for faecal incontinence (219 participants) and two trials of SNS for constipation (61 participants). Two of the faecal incontinence trials had a 'parallel group design', which means that one group of participants received SNS and the other control group did not receive SNS throughout the trial. The remaining six trials had a 'crossover design', in which the participants experienced equal periods with stimulation 'off' then 'on', or vice versa. The level of stimulation was such that participants could not tell whether the system was 'on' or 'off'. In the two 'parallel group' trials, 53 and 15 participants with faecal incontinence who were in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months. In the first crossover trial, 24 participants who completed the trial chose the period of stimulation they had preferred while still unaware whether this was 'on' or 'off'. Nineteen participants who preferred the 'on' period experienced 59% fewer episodes of FI per week during the 'on' period, and 5 participants who preferred the 'off' period experienced 118% more episodes of FI per week. In the second crossover trial, the participants did not experience episodes of FI during either the 'on' or the 'off' periods. In the third trial, participants experienced 83% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' compared with the 'off' period. In the fourth crossover trial participants experienced 88% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' period compared with the 'off' period. \u2014adverse effects:Not all trials reported adverse effects after SNS. The two 'parallel group' trials reported only minor complications, in 10% of SNS participants in the first study, and in 3 participants in the second study. In the first crossover study 7 out of 34 participants were excluded from crossover due mainly to complications. Four out of 27 participants with an implanted system in this study experienced a problem that led to the device being removed. The participants in the fourth crossover trial experienced some complications with the SNS implanted electrode such as pain (one person), misplacement of the tined lead (one person) and haematoma (swelling containing blood) (three people). In one trial assessing SNS for constipation, two participants reported an increase of 150% in the frequency of passing stools per week, and time with abdominal pain and swelling went down from 79% during the 'off' period to 33% during the 'on' period. However, in the much larger second trial assessing SNS for constipation, in 59 participants SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements. The limited evidence suggests that SNS can improve continence in some people with faecal incontinence. SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Larger, good-quality trials are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness of SNS for these two conditions."

We collected the data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer who were staged with EUS. Overall the quality of the included studies was good: in particular, only five studies presented a high risk of index test interpretation bias and two studies presented a high risk of selection bias. For primary tumor (T) stage, results were stratified according to the depth of invasion (A health/illness/pain management principle specifically directed at the management of pharmacologic agents in maximizing beneficial outcomes and minimizing unfavorable effects.) of the gastric wall (The use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of, or delay the development or recurrence of, cancer.). The meta-analysis (Substances used to allow enhanced visualization of tissues.) of 50 studies (n = 4397) showed that the summary sensitivity (Excision of the gallbladder through an abdominal incision using a laparoscope.) and specificity of EUS in discriminating T1 to T2 (superficial) versus T3 to T4 (advanced) gastric carcinomas were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.90) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.93) respectively. For the diagnostic (Having to do with water.) capacity of EUS to distinguish T1 (early gastric cancer, EGC) versus T2 (muscle-infiltrating) tumors, the meta-analysis (Substances used to allow enhanced visualization of tissues.) of 46 studies (n = 2742) showed that the summary sensitivity (Excision of the gallbladder through an abdominal incision using a laparoscope.) and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93) respectively. When we addressed the capacity of EUS to distinguish between T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers the meta-analysis (Substances used to allow enhanced visualization of tissues.) of 20 studies (n = 3321) showed that the summary sensitivity (Excision of the gallbladder through an abdominal incision using a laparoscope.) and specificity were 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.84) respectively. Finally, for the metastatic involvement of lymph nodes (N-stage), the meta-analysis (Substances used to allow enhanced visualization of tissues.) of 44 studies (n = 3573) showed that the summary sensitivity (Excision of the gallbladder through an abdominal incision using a laparoscope.) and specificity were 0.83 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.87) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.72), respectively. Overall, as demonstrated also by the Bayesian nomograms, which enable readers to calculate post-test probabilities for any target condition (A specific result or effect that can be measured.) prevalence, the EUS accuracy can be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric cancer. However, it should be noted that between-study heterogeneity was not negligible: unfortunately, we could not identify any consistent source of the observed heterogeneity. Therefore, all accuracy measures reported in the present work and summarizing the available evidence should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, we must emphasize that the analysis (Substances used to allow enhanced visualization of tissues.) of positive and negative likelihood values revealed that EUS diagnostic (Having to do with water.) performance cannot be considered optimal either for disease (Unsteadiness or trembling movements of the whole body or a body part.) confirmation or for exclusion, especially for the ability of EUS to distinguish T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers and positive versus negative lymph node status. By analyzing the data from the largest series ever considered, we found that the diagnostic (Having to do with water.) accuracy of EUS might be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric carcinoma. However, the heterogeneity of the results warrants special caution, as well as further investigation for the identification of factors (Works about the act or practice of calling public attention to a product, service, need, etc., especially by paid announcements in newspapers, magazines, on radio, or on television.) influencing the outcome of this diagnostic (Having to do with water.) tool. Moreover, physicians should be warned that EUS performance is lower in diagnosing superficial tumors (T1a versus T1b) and lymph node status (positive versus negative). Overall, we observed large heterogeneity and its source needs to be understood before any definitive conclusion can be drawn about the use of EUS can be proposed in routine clinical settings.",

This performance is maintained for the discrimination between T1 and T2 superficial tumors. However, EUS diagnostic accuracy is lower when it comes to distinguishing between the different types of early tumors (T1a versus T1b) and between tumors with versus those without lymph node disease. Overall, EUS provides physicians with some helpful information on the stage of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, in the light of the variability of the results reported in the international medical literature, its limitations in terms of performance must be kept in mind in order to make the most out of the diagnostic potential of this tool. Finally, more work is needed to assess whether some technical improvements and the combination with other staging instruments may increase our ability to correctly stage the disease and thus optimize patient treatment."

Two hundred and thirty-nine people underwent planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy as day-surgery and 253 participants stayed in the hospital overnight after the procedure. All the trials were at high risk of bias (methodological deficiencies that might make it possible to arrive at wrong conclusions by overestimating the benefit or underestimating the harm of the day-surgery or overnight stay procedure). We looked at outcomes that are considered to be important from the perspective of the participant and also the healthcare provider. These outcomes include death, serious complication, quality of life following procedure, pain, how long it took for people to return to normal activity and to return to work, hospital readmissions, and failed discharges (failure to be discharged as planned). There was no significant difference in the proportion who died or the complication rate between the group who underwent day-surgery and those who stayed overnight. Quality of life did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the time taken for people to return to normal activity or to return to work. There was also no significant difference in the hospital readmission or failed discharge rates. The results suggest that day-surgery is safe for patients.

Two studies used a placebo control and six used 0.04% topical capsaicin (common or usual or expected.) as an 'active' placebo to help maintain blinding. Efficacy outcomes were inconsistently reported, resulting in analyses for most outcomes being based on less than complete data. For postherpetic neuralgia, we found four studies (1272 participants).

For painful (An effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation commonly used in the placement of STENTS in CORONARY ARTERIES.) HIV-neuropathy, we found two studies (801 participants). One study reported the proportion of participants who were much or very much improved at 12 weeks (27% with high-concentration capsaicin (common or usual or expected.) and 10% with 'active' placebo). For both studies, more participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline (a loss or alteration in physical functioning that suggests a physical disorder but that actually a direct expression of a psychological conflict or need.) of at least 30% with capsaicin (common or usual or expected.) than control, with an NNT (The most common type of cutaneous cyst.) of 11 (very low quality evidence). For peripheral diabetic neuropathy (Description:Patient exhibits a mild reaction to the challenge agent.), we found one study (369 participants). It reported about 10% more participants who were much or very much improved at 8 and 12 weeks. One small study of 46 participants with persistent pain following inguinal herniorrhaphy did not show a difference between capsaicin (common or usual or expected.) and placebo for pain reduction (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for efficacy outcomes by one to three levels due to sparse data, imprecision, possible effects of imputation methods, and susceptibility to publication bias. Local adverse events were common, but not consistently reported. Serious adverse events were no more common with active treat (Providers of initial care for patients.)ment (3.5%) than control (3.2%). Adverse event (Magnesium chloride.) withdrawals did not differ between groups, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were somewhat more common with control than active treat (Providers of initial care for patients.)ment, based on small numbers of events (six to eight studies, 21 to 67 events; moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to few events). No deaths were judged to be related to study medication (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.). High-concentration topical capsaicin (common or usual or expected.) used to treat (Providers of initial care for patients.) postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-neuropathy, and painful (An effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation commonly used in the placement of STENTS in CORONARY ARTERIES.) diabetic neuropathy generated more participants with moderate or substantial levels of pain relief (The act of regarding attentively and studying facts and occurrences, gathering data through analyzing, measuring, and drawing conclusions, with the purpose of applying the observed information to theoretical assumptions.) than control treat (Providers of initial care for patients.)ment using a much lower concentration of capsaicin (common or usual or expected.). These results should be interpreted with caution as the quality of the evidence was moderate or very low. The additional proportion who benefited over control was not large, but for those who did obtain high levels of pain relief (The act of regarding attentively and studying facts and occurrences, gathering data through analyzing, measuring, and drawing conclusions, with the purpose of applying the observed information to theoretical assumptions.), there were usually additional improvements in sleep, fatigue, depression (Being or located on or directed toward the side of the body to the west when facing north.), and quality of life.

                "We searched scientific databases for studies that looked at the effects of high-concentration capsaicin in adults who had moderate or severe neuropathic pain. The treatment had to have effects measured for at least 8 weeks. The evidence is current to June 2016. Eight studies satisfied our inclusion criteria, including two new studies for this update. The studies were well conducted. In seven studies, involving 2442 participants, we found that the treatment gave good levels of pain relief to a small number of participants with some types of neuropathic pain (pain after shingles, and nerve injury pain associated with HIV infection), and probably also in another type (painful feet because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes). About 4 in 10 people had at least moderate pain relief with capsaicin compared with 3 in 10 with control. The control was a treatment that looked the same but did not contain high levels of capsaicin, with either nothing added, or very small amounts of capsaicin added. In one small study (46 participants) in people with persistent pain after hernia surgery, it did not seem better than control. In all people who have this treatment there can be short-lived localised skin problems such as redness, burning, or pain. Serious problems seem to be uncommon, and were no more frequent in these trials with high-concentration capsaicin than with control using very low-concentration capsaicin or placebo. Slightly more people treated with control rather than capsaicin dropped out of the studies because of lack of benefit, but there was no difference between the groups for drop-outs because of side effects. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate or very low for pain relief outcomes, mainly because only a small number of studies and moderate number of participants provided information for each outcome. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate for harmful effects. Moderate quality means that further research may change the result. Very low quality means we are very uncertain about the results."

The trials were carried out in Europe, USA, and Canada and included some centres in Israel, South Africa, and Australia. The gender ratio of participants was 2.6:1 (72% men and 28% women); 90% of participants were younger than 75 years old. The results of the three trials were initially conflicting because they differed in how they measured carotid stenosis and how they defined the outcomes. To address this discrepancy, we reassessed the patient data using the same methods and definitions, so results could be compared. The results of the review are current up to July 2016. Results showed that older male participants with 70% to 99% stenosis, without occlusion, and recent (within two weeks) TIA or stroke, had the most benefit from surgery, assuming they were well enough for surgery, and their surgeons had a record of low complication rates (less than 7% risk of stroke and death). Carotid endarterectomy also benefited participants with 50% to 99% carotid stenosis and symptoms. For participants whose carotid artery was nearly occluded, benefit was uncertain in the long term. Surgery tended to harm participants with less than 30% stenosis. The second European Carotid Surgery Trial, which is currently recruiting participants, is exploring whether a lipid lowering agent (statin) might be a better choice than carotid endarterectomy to prevent ischaemic stroke in ipsilateral carotid stenosis, which may benefit those who did not benefit from surgery in these trials. We found the evidence to be high quality for near occlusion and less than 30% carotid stenosis; and moderate quality for 50% to 99% carotid stenosis for any stroke or operative death, as well as ipsilateral ischaemic stroke and any operative stroke or death outcome."

Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma-related outcomes of interest. None of the studies measured other stoma-related problems, or death. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies.

After examining them all, the authors concluded that there is not enough evidence to support the use of silver-containing dressings or creams, as generally these treatments did not promote wound healing or prevent wound infections. Some evidence from a number of small, poor-quality studies suggested that one silver-containing compound (silver sulphadiazine) has no effect on infection, and actually slows down healing in patients with partial-thickness burns."

We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison.

For our second comparison of combination therapy (A discrepancy between a computed, observed, or measured value or condition and the true, specified, or theoretically correct value or condition.) with optional adjunctives only one meta-analysis (Any natural or laboratory-made substance that has some or all of the biologic effects of progesterone, a female hormone.) could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic (An organized and comprehensive program of health care that identifies and reduces a woman's reproductive risks before conception through risk assessment, health promotion, and interventions.) regimens. Two studies (Studies in which variables relating to an individual or group of individuals are assessed over a period of time.) compared tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin (Place or physical location of work or employment.) for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable (An absence finding of the specified component / analyte, organism or clinical sign based on the established threshold of the performed test or procedure.) population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (Place or physical location of work or employment.)

Since studies (Studies in which variables relating to an individual or group of individuals are assessed over a period of time.) did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups.

Due to lack of studies (Studies in which variables relating to an individual or group of individuals are assessed over a period of time.), we could not evaluate the best antibiotic (An organized and comprehensive program of health care that identifies and reduces a woman's reproductive risks before conception through risk assessment, health promotion, and interventions.) choice for VAP (A symptom and a finding during physical examination, characterized by a high-pitched, whistling sound during breathing.), but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotic (An organized and comprehensive program of health care that identifies and reduces a woman's reproductive risks before conception through risk assessment, health promotion, and interventions.)s (Actions performed to pour liquid into a catheter).",

We analysed 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies looked at the use of one antibiotic treatment plan versus another, but these varied among studies. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants, and funding for many was provided by pharmaceutical companies and study authors were affiliated with these companies. We used statistical techniques to evaluate our results. For single versus multiple antibiotics, we found no difference in rates of death or cure, or adverse events. For our comparison of combination therapies with optional adjunctives we were only able to analyse clinical cure for one the antibiotics Tigecycline and imipenem-cilastatin for which imipenem-cilastatin was found to have higher clinica cure. We also looked at carbapenem (antibiotics used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria) versus non-carbapenem treatment; we found no difference in death rate or adverse effects, but we found that carbapenems are associated with an increase in clinical cure. We assessed evidence quality as moderate for most outcomes, and very low for clinical cure when single-antibiotic treatment was compared with multiple antibiotic therapy. We also found that evidence quality was low for adverse events when carbapenem was compared with non-carbapenem treatment. We did not find differences between single and combination therapy, lending support to use of a single-antibiotic treatment plan for people with ventilator-associated pneumonia. This may not be applicable to all patients because studies did not identify patients who are at risk of exposure to harmful types of bacteria. We could not evaluate the best single-antibiotic choice to treat people with ventilator-associated pneumonia because there were too few studies, but carbapenems may achieve better cure rates than other tested antibiotics."

Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs (Administration of nutritional support by means of a tube passed into the stomach.) increased treatment discontinuity and the use of other health services without reducing overall drug expenditures (2 studies (The ability of an optically active substance to rotate the plane of polarized light counterclockwise (to the left).)). Relaxing restrictions for reimbursement of antihypertensives and statins increased appropriate use and decreased overall drug expenditures. Two studies (The ability of an optically active substance to rotate the plane of polarized light counterclockwise (to the left).) which measured health outcomes directly were inconclusive. Implementing restrictions to coverage and reimbursement of selected medications (between ARGININE and VALINE.) can decrease third-party drug spending without increasing the use of other health services (6 studies (The ability of an optically active substance to rotate the plane of polarized light counterclockwise (to the left).)). Relaxing reimbursement rules for drugs used for secondary prevention (The morpholinoethyl ester of mycophenolic acid (MPA).) can also remove barriers to access.

Where drugs have cheaper, effective alternatives and they target symptoms, this review found that reimbursement restriction polices can ensure better use of the medications with reduced costs and without an increase in the use of other health services, as would be expected if there were negative health effects of the restriction policies. Evaluation is required if alternative drugs are not effective substitutes. Removing restrictions for drugs that prevent complications of disease can result in an intended increase in their use as well as cost savings.

There was substantial clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies (Bony structure of the mouth that holds the teeth.) and it was not deemed appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis. We summarised data by categorising similar interventions into comparison groups. Comparison 1: Any form of one-to-one OHA versus no OHA Four studies (Bony structure of the mouth that holds the teeth.) compared any form of one-to-one OHA versus no OHA. Two studies (Bony structure of the mouth that holds the teeth.) reported the outcome of gingivitis.

We included research where individual patients received oral hygiene advice from a dental care professional on a one-to-one basis in a dental clinic setting with a minimum of 8 weeks follow-up. In total, within the identified 19 studies, oral hygiene advice was provided by a hygienist in eight studies, dentist in four studies, dental nurse in one study, dentist or hygienist in one study, dental nurse and hygienist in one study, and dental nurse oral hygiene advice to the control group with further self-administration of the intervention in one study. It was unclear in three of the studies which member of the dental team carried out the intervention. Over half of the studies (10 of the 19) were conducted in a hospital setting, with only five studies conducted in a general dental practice setting (where oral hygiene advice is largely delivered). Overall we found insufficient evidence to recommend any specific method of one- to-one oral hygiene advice as being more effective than another in maintaining or improving oral health. The studies we found varied considerably in how the oral hygiene advice was delivered, by whom and what outcomes were looked at. Due to this it was difficult to readily compare these studies and further well designed studies should be conducted to give a more accurate conclusion as to the most effective method of maintaining or improving oral health through one-to-one oral hygiene advice delivered by a dental care professional in a dental setting. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to problems with the design of the studies."

No serious adverse events from the herbal medicines were reported. Some herbal medicines may improve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.

                "Traditional Chinese herbal medicine is a common practice in the East, and some clinical trials show a benefit of herbal medicines for symptomatic treatment of this condition. This systematic review identified and included 75 randomised clinical trials evaluating the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with irritable bowel syndrome. The review shows that some herbal medicines improve global symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or constipation. However, the methodological quality of the majority of clinical trials evaluating these herbs was generally poor. There is evidence indicating that small, poor quality trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. Although the included trials did not report serious adverse effects from using herbal medicines more research is needed to determine the safety of herbal medicines. In conclusion, herbal medicines might be promising for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. However, it is premature to recommend herbal medicines for routine use in irritable bowel syndrome. Testing the herbs in larger, well-designed trials is needed in order to establish sound evidence for their use."

The studies included a total of 12,400 participants, and were conducted in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The drugs (Involving advantage or good.) and doses evaluated included levonorgestrel (Chewing gum which contains NICOTINE.) (LNG) 0.75 mg (11 studies), LNG in doses other than 0.75 mg (4 trials), and hormones (Regions near to the trachea.) other than LNG (7 trials). Outcomes included pregnancy rates, discontinuation, side effects, and acceptability. Pericoital levonorgestrel (A person's permanent place of residence.) (Chewing gum which contains NICOTINE.) was reasonably efficacious and safe. The pooled Pearl Index for the 0.75 mg dose of LNG was 5.4 per 100 woman-years (95% CI 4.1 to 7.0).

(The amount of force generated by MUSCLE CONTRACTION.) appeared promising but most of them were not studied extensively. Menstrual irregularities were the most common side effects reported. However, the studies provided no consistent evidence of a relationship between bleeding abnormalities (A dosing unit equal to the amount of active ingredient(s) contained in a puff.) and either frequency of pill intake or total dose of the drug. Non-menstrual side effects were reportedly mild and not tabulated in most studies. Most women liked the pericoital method in spite of frequent menstrual irregularities. The studies of pericoital LNG regimens provided promising results but many had serious methodological issues.\u00a0Most reports were decades old and provided limited information. However, we considered the evidence to be moderate quality because of the large number of participants from diverse populations, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results across studies. Rigorous research is still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pericoital use of LNG as a primary means of contraception among women with infrequent intercourse. If the method is shown to be efficacious, safe and acceptable, the results may warrant revision of the current World Health Organization recommendations and marketing strategies.",

We assessed the quality of the research methods in the studies. We used the Pearl Index to estimate the effect. The Pearl Index is the number of pregnancies for every 100 years of pill use. We found 22 studies from the past 40 years. They included a total of 12,400 women in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Fifteen trials studied different doses of the hormone levonorgestrel and seven looked at other hormones. These studies showed that using some hormones right before or after sex did prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel seemed to work well, and was safe and accepted by thousands of women in several large trials. The most common side effects were menstrual bleeding problems. However, such bleeding issues were not always related to how often women took the pills or the total dose of the drug. Most studies were old and many reports were not complete. However, the data had moderate quality because of the many women in these studies, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results. We do not know for sure whether using levonorgestrel repeatedly around the time of sex is a good and safe method of birth control. More high-quality research is needed to answer the question."

The studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years).

We carried out a random-effects model meta-analysis for the seven studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) that fully reported this outcome. There was strong evidence of an effect of surgical (A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells.) anchorage on this outcome. Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical (A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells.) anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 mm to -1.09 mm; seven studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), 308 participants analysed) with moderate quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias, five studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at unclear risk of bias, one study at low risk of bias). This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical (A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells.) and conventional anchorage (-0.15 years; 95% CI -0.37 years to 0.07 years; three studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), 111 analysed patients) with low quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias and two studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at unclear risk of bias). Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and acceptability was limited and inconclusive. When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical (A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells.) anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another. No included studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) reported adverse effects.

While surgical (A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells.) anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to extraoral headgear (Any method of measuring the amount of work done by an organism, usually during PHYSICAL EXERTION.), none of the included studies (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) reported on harms (The protrusion of an organ or part of an organ into a natural or artificial orifice.) of surgical (A type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances, such as monoclonal antibodies, to identify and attack specific cancer cells.) or conventional anchorage.",

Fifteen studies were included in this review involving data from 561 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. Most took place in university settings or training hospitals and one in a specialist orthodontic practice. Most studies contained a similar number of males and females, however there were more females than males in five studies and only females in two. The age range varied from adolescents and young adults to adults up to the age of 54 years. All participants in the studies needed a course of orthodontic treatment with additional anchorage control. None of the studies reported adverse effects. When surgically implanted anchorage devices were compared to conventional anchorage devices, they were better in providing stabilisation for preventing unwanted movement in teeth during orthodontic treatment. There was limited information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and how acceptable the devices were found to be. No information was reported on adverse events. The quality of the evidence for the important outcomes in this review ranged from moderate to low quality. The main shortcomings of all of the studies were related to issues with their design and the way they were carried out, with insufficient and low quality reporting of the study methods and outcomes."

This was apart from the two on cerebral palsy where pain relief occurred with the use of baclofen delivered via a catheter into the spinal cord. However the procedure to deliver this medication resulted in most side effect reported in these trials; this was swelling at the site of the catheter, and in one study it reported that this occurred in around half of the children (8/17). Five children also leaked spinal fluid from the catheter resulting in headache and nausea and, for two children, a prolonged hospital stay. The trials were limited by the quality of their methods and most did not set out to measure the benefit of the drug in reducing pain as a main focus. In conclusion, the evidence on pain treatment in children and young people with life-limiting health conditions is very limited, and only evaluated in participants with certain diseases and not for drug treatments primarily used to treat pain.

                "This review included seven studies (specifically randomised controlled trials), involving 735 people. The studies compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke. The included trials were carried out in China, Denmark, and the UK. The results of this review are current up to January 2018. In people with narrowing of arteries in the brain, RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow. However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear. Adverse events were significantly more common in the RIC group but were not reported to be severe. Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others). We found no significant differences in the size of the final stroke. In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability. There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication. The evidence is less clear for reducing the volume of the stroke (size of brain lesion caused by low blood flow). Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these findings."

There were no data on outcomes after hospital discharge. Our findings may not be generalisable to low-resource settings, as none of the included studies were conducted in these settings. Since protein supplementation of human milk is now usually done as a component of multi-nutrient fortifiers, future studies should compare different amounts of protein in multi-component fortifiers, and be designed to determine the effects on duration of hospital stay and safety, as well as on long-term growth, body composition, cardio-metabolic, and neurodevelopmental (Psychological aspects of SMOKING.) outcomes.",

In terms of statistically significant effects, some interventions improved condom-related behaviour and reduced the number of sexual partners, but none affected the frequency of sexual episodes. Effects of interventions on STIs were limited. None of the interventions appeared to be harmful. The methods used in the trials were not always well described making it difficult to tell whether their results may have been biased.

In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup (A province of Canada lying between the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec.) received intramuscular dexamethasone (An immunosuppressive agent used in combination with cyclophosphamide and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.)

Heliox (Mycoses which manifest as infections of deep tissue or blood.) may slightly improve croup (A province of Canada lying between the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec.) scores at 90 minutes postintervention, but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting. Information on hospitalisation or re-presenting to the emergency department was not reported. The included studies did not report on adverse events (The year in which an individual began smoking.), intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety (Calcification, that is, pathological deposition of calcium salts in the aorta.). We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study. Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox (Mycoses which manifest as infections of deep tissue or blood.) may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen (INFLAMMATION of any segment of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT from ESOPHAGUS to RECTUM.) for children with mild croup (A province of Canada lying between the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec.), but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup (A province of Canada lying between the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec.) treated with dexamethasone (An immunosuppressive agent used in combination with cyclophosphamide and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.). The effect may be similar to 100% oxygen (INFLAMMATION of any segment of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT from ESOPHAGUS to RECTUM.) given with one or two doses of adrenaline (A synthetic, broad-spectrum antifungal agent with additional antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities.). Adverse events were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup (A province of Canada lying between the provinces of Manitoba and Quebec.).",

Reporting of index and reference tests was poor. The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident and emergency settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%. There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies (Behaviors associated with the ingesting of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, including social drinking.). Descriptive analyses revealed that three red flags in primary care were potentially useful with meaningful positive likelihood ratios (LR+) but mostly imprecise estimates (significant trauma, older age, corticosteroid use; LR+ point estimate ranging 3.42 to 12.85, 3.69 to 9.39, 3.97 to 48.50 respectively). One red flag in tertiary care appeared informative (contusion/abrasion; LR+ 31.09, 95% CI 18.25 to 52.96). The results of combined tests appeared more informative than individual red flags with LR+ estimates generally greater in magnitude and precision. The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for LBP. Based on evidence from single studies (Behaviors associated with the ingesting of ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, including social drinking.), few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. When combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. It should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with LBP. Further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.",

A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma (Carrier proteins produced in the Sertoli cells of the testis, secreted into the seminiferous tubules, and transported via the efferent ducts to the epididymis.) contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS). Age, severity of airway (The amount of medicine taken, or radiation given, at one time.) obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03).

The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options.. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway (The amount of medicine taken, or radiation given, at one time.) inflammation (The period of time immediately after labor and delivery.), asthma control and reliever (procedures performed on the blood vessels with the intent of restoring the circulation or integrity of the blood vessels and to improve circulation deficiencies due to disease, injuries, or deformities.) use.

However, there was not enough information to conclude to that the two approaches were equivalent. We found that people taking inhaled corticosteroids everyday had slightly better asthma control with better lung function, less use of reliever medication and more symptom-free days than those taking inhaled corticosteroids intermittently. We also observed that compared to intermittent inhaled corticosteroids, children grew slightly less with daily inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone (inhaled corticosteroids are known to affect growth), underlying the importance of using the safest and lowest effective dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We did not observe any significant group difference in the rate of withdrawals or adverse effects. These results do not provide firm conclusions, although the improvement in asthma control, lung function and airway inflammation would provide slightly greater support for the use of inhaled corticosteroids every day as compared to taking them only when symptoms get worse.

Diets involved increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing poultry and fish, higher nut and olive oil use, and some increases in cereals and legumes (e.g. beans), and less red meat, sugar, and salt. We looked particularly at three key outcomes: the risk of death, the risk of advanced kidney disease requiring dialysis, and quality of life. There were four studies involving people who have had a kidney transplant and three studies involving people treated with dialysis. After combining the available studies, it was uncertain whether making healthy diet changes prevented heart complications as most studies did not measure these. Diet changes may improve life quality. We did see that some risk factors for future disease, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, were lower following diet counselling or healthier eating. The quality of the included studies was often very low meaning we could not be sure that future studies would find similar results. We are very uncertain whether dietary changes improve well-being for people with kidney disease because the available research studies were not designed to learn about these. Diet changes may lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but the longer term impact of these effects on well-being is not proven.

While a daily dose of prednisone at 0.75 mg/kg/day resulted in significant improvements in some strength and function parameters compared with placebo (The act of providing a short account.), there was no significant difference in ankle range of motion between groups.

By 24 months, many boys in the surgical group experienced a relapse of achilles tendon contractures.

Four studies were included in the review involving a total of 149 participants. Two studies showed that wearing a night splint was no more effective than not wearing a night splint for increasing ankle flexibility in 26 people who had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. One study showed corticosteroids (prednisone) did not significantly improve ankle flexibility in 103 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the other study showed that while orthopaedic surgery initially increased ankle flexibility in 20 young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy this was not sustained in the long term. This review shows that, currently, there is limited evidence supporting any intervention for improving ankle flexibility in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. More research is needed."

Babies of mothers who were upright were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, however this was based on one trial (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89, one study, 200 women).

There is clear and important evidence that walking and upright positions in the first stage of labour reduces the duration of labour, the risk of caesarean birth (Four or five slender jointed digits in humans and primates, attached to each HAND.), the need for epidural, and does not seem to be associated with increased intervention (The cessation of life due to heart abnormalities or disease.) or negative effects on mothers' and babies' well being. Given the great heterogeneity and high performance bias of study situations, better quality trials are still required to confirm with any confidence the true risks and benefits of upright and mobile positions compared with recumbent positions for all women. Based on the current findings, we recommend that women in low-risk labour should be informed of the benefits of upright positions, and encouraged and assisted to assume whatever positions they choose.",

                "This review included 25 studies (involving 5218 women). Although many studies were not of high quality, and most of the women were low risk, they did show that the first stage of labour may be approximately one hour and twenty minutes shorter for women who are upright or walk around. As every contraction is potentially painful, and prolonged labour can be an overwhelming and exhausting process resulting in an increased need for medical intervention, this is a meaningful outcome for women. Indeed other important outcomes for women who were upright and mobile compared with lying down in bed included a reduction in the risk of caesarean birth, less use of epidural as a method of pain relief, and less chance of their babies being admitted to the neonatal unit. More research of better quality is still needed to validate these results for all women in labour. However, based on the results of this review we recommend that wherever possible, women should be encouraged and supported to use upright and mobile positions of their choice during first stage labour, as this may enhance the progress of their labour and may lead to better outcomes for themselves and their babies."

One trial compared surgery to remove the first rib (transaxillary first rib resection) with surgery in which the surgeon freed the nerves from surrounding tissues (neuroplasty) without removing a rib, in 55 people with the disputed type of TOS. The participants had not responded to non-surgical treatments. Average follow-up was 37 months. A second trial analyzed 19 people who underwent double-blinded provision of a single injection of BTX (muscle relaxant) into the scalene muscles of the neck, and 18 people in the placebo group who received no active injection, with follow-up at six weeks, three months and, critically for the purpose of this review, six months. There is very low quality evidence that removal of a rib reduced pain from 'disputed' TOS more than a neuroplasty procedure. We identified issues in study design that could have affected the outcome of the trial. There were no adverse effects in either group. There were no trials of surgery versus no treatment. The trial comparing the intervention of BTX injection with placebo provided moderate evidence that this procedure does not significantly reduce pain or disability scores long term, although there were no adverse events associated with the procedure over placebo. This systematic review demonstrated that there is not enough evidence that the established interventions for TOS are helpful in relieving pain. Until high quality, randomized clinical trials comparing the various interventions for TOS are performed, the decision whether to treat and the choice of appropriate treatment will have to be based on the preferences of the individual and health care provider.

(n = 290) with sham injections (Chemical substances having a specific regulatory effect on the activity of a certain organ or organs.) (n = 147). We observed characteristics indicative of high risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data in SCORE and selective outcome reporting in GENEVA. Loss to follow-up was high with 10% in the steroid groups and almost twice as much (17%) in the observation group. GENEVA enrolled participants with both branch and central retinal (Providers of initial care for patients.) vein occlusion (The systematic and methodical manipulations of body tissues best performed with the hands for the purpose of affecting the nervous and muscular systems and the general circulation.), but did not present subgroup data for the CRVO-ME population. A qualitative assessment of the results from GENEVA indicated that the dexamethasone implant (Having been determined by measurement.) was not associated with improvement in visual acuity after six months among participants with CRVO-ME. Although the SCORE investigators reported that participants treated with 1 mg (n = 82) or 4 mg (n = 83) triamcinolone intravitreal injections (Chemical substances having a specific regulatory effect on the activity of a certain organ or organs.) were five times more likely to have gained 15 letters or more in visual acuity compared with participants in the observation group (1 mg; risk ratio (RR): 5.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62 to 17.15; 4 mg RR 4.92; 95% CI 1.50 to 16.10) by the eighth-month follow-up examination, the average visual acuity decreased in all three groups. However, eyes treated with triamcinolone lost fewer letters than participants in the observation group at 8 months (1 mg mean difference (MD): 8.70 letters, 95% CI 1.86 to 15.54; 4 mg MD: 9.80 letters, 95% CI 3.32 to 16.28). A higher incidence of adverse event (Visible accumulations of fluid within or beneath the epidermis.)s was noted with IVS therapy when compared with observation alone. As many as 20% to 35% of participants experienced an adverse event (Visible accumulations of fluid within or beneath the epidermis.) in the IVS groups compared with 8% of participants in the observation group of the SCORE study. The GENEVA investigators reported 63% in the treatment arm versus 43% in the observation arm experienced an adverse event (Visible accumulations of fluid within or beneath the epidermis.). The most commonly encountered adverse event (Visible accumulations of fluid within or beneath the epidermis.)s were elevated intraocular pressure, progression (Implantable devices which continuously monitor the electrical activity of the heart and automatically detect and terminate ventricular tachycardia (TACHYCARDIA, VENTRICULAR) and VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION.) of cataracts, and retinal (Providers of initial care for patients.) neovascularization. We graded the quality of evidence as low due to study limitations, imprecision of treatment estimates, and selective outcome reporting. The two RCTs reviewed herein provide insufficient evidence to determine the benefits of IVS for individuals with CRVO-ME. The improvement in visual acuity noted in the SCORE trial should be interpreted with caution as outcome data were missing for a large proportion of the observation group.

Both trials included participants with similar baseline characteristics with respect to age, gender, and co-morbidities. GENEVA was conducted in 24 countries across the world and SCORE was conducted in the US. Both trials compared two different doses of steroid, but the investigators of the two trials used different steroidal agents and different methods of delivery (implant versus injection). Both trials received full or partial sponsorship from the manufacturer of the drugs. Neither trial provided sufficient evidence to determine whether steroids had improved visual acuity after six months of treatment. Due to the limited evidence, we are unable to determine reliably whether steroid implants improved vision in eyes with CRVO-ME. Although the SCORE trial showed that more eyes in the steroid injection groups had improvement in vision compared with eyes in the observation group, participants treated with steroids and those not treated with steroids both lost vision on average at eight months. The GENEVA investigators reported no difference in vision outcomes between participants treated with steroids and those not treated with steroids after six months of treatment; however the GENEVA study was not limited to participants with only CRVO-ME and included participants with other retinal disease. Both trials showed that patients treated with steroids were at increased risk for high eye pressure - requiring additional medications to lower the eye pressure - and developing cataracts. The overall quality of the evidence was low due to clinical differences between studies, incomplete information available to assess outcomes, and lack of masking which may lead to biased study results."

However, the change in maternal mean arterial pressure and systolic arterial pressure, which were the other reported outcomes of this trial, were not significantly different between the two groups.

However there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show that the effect of epidural translates into improved maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, there is a need for larger, well-designed studies to come to an evidence-based conclusion as to whether the lowering of vasomotor tone by epidural therapy results in better maternal and fetal outcomes and for how long that could be maintained. Another important question that needs to be answered is how long should extended epidural be used to ensure any potential clinical benefits and what could be the associated side effects and costs.

There was no evidence of effect of glucocorticosteroids (A collective expression for all behavior patterns acquired and socially transmitted through symbols.) on all-cause mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.15; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence) or on health-related quality of life up to three months, measured with the European Quality of Life \u2013 5 Dimensions \u2013 3 Levels scale (MD \u20130.04 points, 95% CI \u20130.11 to 0.03; participants = 377; trial = 1; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events during treatment (random-effects RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.29; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), liver-related mortality up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; participants = 1861; trials = 15; very low-certainty evidence), number of participants with any complications up to three months following randomisation (random-effects RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; participants = 1861; very low-certainty evidence), and number of participants of non-serious adverse events up to three months' follow-up after end of treatment (random-effects RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.72 to 5.48; participants = 160; trials = 4; very low-certainty evidence). Based on the information that we collected from the published trial reports, only one of the trials seems not to be industry-funded, and the remaining 15 trials did not report clearly whether they were partly or completely funded by the industry. We are very uncertain about the effect estimate of no difference between glucocorticosteroids (A collective expression for all behavior patterns acquired and socially transmitted through symbols.) and placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality and serious adverse events during treatment because the certainty of evidence was very low, and low for health-related quality of life. Due to inadequate reporting, we cannot exclude increases in adverse events. As the CIs were wide, we cannot rule out significant benefits or harms of glucocorticosteroids (A collective expression for all behavior patterns acquired and socially transmitted through symbols.). Therefore, we need placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials, designed according to the SPIRIT guidelines and reported according to the CONSORT guidelines. Future trials ought to report depersonalised individual participant data, so that proper individual participant data meta-analyses of the effects of glucocorticosteroids (A collective expression for all behavior patterns acquired and socially transmitted through symbols.) in subgroups can be conducted.",

Fifteen trials provided data for analysis (927 participants received glucocorticosteroids and 934 participants received placebo or no intervention). Glucocorticosteroids were administered orally or as an injection for a median of 28 days (range 3 days to 12 weeks). The trial participants were between 25 and 70 years old, 65% were men, and had different stages of alcoholic liver disease. Trial participants were followed up to the moment of discharge from the hospital, or until they died (a median of 63 days), or for at least one year. Not all trials reported the follow-up of participants. The trials were conducted in France, India, the UK, and the USA. Two trials administered pentoxifylline (a medicine used for diseases of the blood vessels) to both glucocorticosteroids and placebo intervention groups. Based on the information that we collected from the published trial reports, only one of the trials seems not to be industry-funded, and the remaining 15 trials did not report clearly whether they were partly or completely funded by the industry. The overall reliability of the evidence was low for health-related quality of life and very low for death due to any cause up to three months following entry in the trial; serious side effects during treatment; liver-related death up to three months following entry in the trial; number of participants with any complications up to three months following entry in the trial, and number of participants non-serious side effects up to three months' follow-up after the end of treatment. All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias, which means that there is possibility of drawing wrong conclusions, exaggerating benefits, or underestimating harms of glucocorticosteroids because of the way the trials were conducted and analysed. We could not determine whether glucocorticosteroids had a positive or negative effect on people with alcoholic liver disease. Despite available data on outcomes which included mortality, health-related quality of life, and serious complications, we were unable to draw firm conclusions mainly because available data were still insufficient to produce robust results, trials were small, and the included participants differed in severity of disease. Therefore, we have very little confidence in our conclusions."

Intervention approaches included the contextual approach of driving simulation and underlying skill development approach, including the retraining of speed of visual processing and visual motor skills. The studies (Acquainted with knowledge of a subject.) were conducted with people who were relatively young and the timing after stroke (A difficulty, disorder, or condition needing resolution.) was varied. Primary outcome: there was no clear evidence of improved on-road scores immediately after training in any of the four studies (Acquainted with knowledge of a subject.), or at six months (mean difference 15 points on the Test Ride (The concave interior of the eye, consisting of the retina, the choroid, the sclera, the optic disk, and blood vessels, seen by means of the ophthalmoscope.) for Investigating Practical Fitness to Drive - Belgian version, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 4.56 to 34.56, P value = 0.15, one study, 83 participants).

There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the use of rehabilitation (Any physical or mental impairment that interferes with an individual's ability to perform desired activities.) to improve on-road driving skills after stroke (A difficulty, disorder, or condition needing resolution.). We found limited evidence that the use of a driving simulator (Advanced and highly specialized care provided to medical or surgical patients whose conditions are life-threatening and require comprehensive care and constant monitoring.) may be beneficial in improving visuocognitive abilities, such as road sign recognition that are related to driving. Moreover, we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated on-road driving lessons as an intervention. At present, it is unclear which impairments (A ticlopidine analog and platelet purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist that inhibits adenosine diphosphate-mediated PLATELET AGGREGATION.) that influence driving ability after stroke (A difficulty, disorder, or condition needing resolution.) are amenable to rehabilitation (Any physical or mental impairment that interferes with an individual's ability to perform desired activities.), and whether the contextual or remedial approaches, or a combination of both, are more efficacious.",

All studies compared the effectiveness of the driving intervention on improving whether drivers passed or failed on a driving assessment.

One trial found that training on a driving simulator resulted in improved performance on a test of recognising road signs immediately after training.

Mean ages (One of a set of bone-like structures in the mouth used for biting and chewing.) of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies (Infection within the PERITONEAL CAVITY.) contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.) treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more). No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.) treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more). Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.) treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37). In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event (the involvement of the CARDIAC MUSCLE itself.) was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.) treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)).

Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.)s (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates. The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.) versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid (used to treat internal or systemic MYCOSES.) for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.",

Most of the people in these studies were in their late sixties and had severe or very severe symptoms of COPD; more men than women took part. The last search for studies to be included in the review was conducted in March 2017. No differences were observed between shorter and longer courses of treatment. People treated for seven or fewer days did not have a higher rate of treatment failure or longer time to their next exacerbation; the number of people who avoided treatment failure ranged from 51 fewer to 34 more per 1000 treated (average 22 fewer people per 1000). Time in hospital and lung function (blowing tests) at the end of treatment were not different. No differences in side effects or death were noted between treatments. Information on quality of life, which is an important outcome for people with COPD, is limited, as only one study measured it. The eight studies included in this review were generally well designed, and the quality of the evidence was rated as moderate because of imprecision in results; more research, especially involving people with less severe COPD, is needed."

The third study provided one 2- to 3-hour group session followed by bi-weekly, individual clinic-based sessions plus once-weekly home-based sessions for 12 weeks. Because of the different study designs and outcome measures used, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. We judged all three studies (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants (not possible due to the nature of the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.)) and blinding of outcome assessors, and at an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. We judged one study to be at unclear risk of selection bias, as authors did not report the methods used to generate the random sequence; at high risk of reporting bias, as they did not report on one assessed outcome; and at high risk of detection (The larger lobe of the left lung, situated below and behind the oblique fissure.) bias, as the control group had a cointervention (receiving.)

Two studies (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) found no differences in expressive or receptive language abilities between the groups, whether measured by direct assessment or parent reports. However, they did find that children in the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with language targets (A loose confederation of computer communication networks around the world.) in certain contexts postintervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.), compared to those in the control group; this was not maintained 12 months later. The third study found gains for the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) group on total-language measures immediately postintervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.). One study did not find any differences in parental stress scores between the groups at any time point up to 12 months postintervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.). All three studies (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) noted differences in most measures of how the parents talked to and interacted with their children postintervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.), and in one study most strategies were maintained in the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) group at 12 months postintervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.). No study reported evidence of language attrition following the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) in either group, while one study found positive outcomes on children's socialisation skills in the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) group. One study looked at adherence to the treatment through attendance data, finding (Recovered, restored to healthy condition by natural processes, e.g.) that mothers in the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.) group attended seven out of nine group sessions and were present for four home visits.

This means that we have very little confidence in the results, and further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of treatment effect. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effects of parent-mediated intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.)s for improving the language and communication of children with Down syndrome.

Trials should use valid, reliable and similar measures of language development, and they should include measures of secondary outcomes more distal to the intervention (A position, opinion, or judgment reached on an issue under consideration.), such as family well-being.

                "The evidence is current to January 2018. We found three studies involving 45 children aged between 29 months and six years. Two studies were randomised controlled trials: experiments in which children were allocated to treatment (i.e. parent-mediated) and control (treatment as usual or clinician-mediated, or both) groups using a random method such as a computer-generated list of random numbers. The other study reported that randomisation took place but did not specify how this was done. Two studies compared parent-mediated intervention to treatment as usual. One of these lasted for 13 weeks, and parents in the intervention group received nine, weekly group sessions and four individual sessions in the home. The total intervention time was approximately 26.5 hours. A second study lasted for six months, and parents received weekly, 1.5- to 2-hour clinic or home-based, individualised, parent-child sessions. The total intervention time was approximately 48 hours. A third study compared a parent- and clinician-mediated intervention to a clinician-only-mediated intervention. In this study the parents in the intervention group took part in a two- to three-hour interactive workshop plus three individualised sessions (two clinic-based and one home-based) every week for 12 weeks. The control group received the same individualised sessions, but a clinician delivered them (i.e. there was no parental involvement). The total intervention time was approximately 19 hours. A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study. Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA. The remaining study did not specify any funding sources. Two of the three studies found no differences in children's language ability after parent training. However, these same two studies found that children in the intervention group used more words that had been specifically targeted, postintervention; this was not maintained 12 months later. The study that gave parents the largest amount of intervention reported gains on general measures of overall language ability for children in the intervention group. One study did not find any changes in levels of parental stress immediately or up to 12 months postintervention in either group. All three studies noted changes in how parents talked to and interacted with their children immediately postintervention, and most strategies were retained by the intervention group 12 months later. One study reported increases in the socialisation skills of children who received the intervention. No study reported language attrition in either group postintervention. We rated the quality of the evidence in this review as very low, as only three studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, and all had small sizes and serious methodological limitations. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effect of parent-mediated interventions for improving the communication and language development in young children with Down syndrome."

Our literature searches were undertaken up to March 2015. We found two randomised clinical trials published in 1987 and 2004 that included a total of 148 participants. Due to the limited amount of data, we were not able to determine the effect of exercise-based rehabilitation on mortality, serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, ability to return to work, New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction, or cost. However, exercise-based rehabilitation did appear to increase exercise capacity at up to 12 months follow-up, although this should be interpreted with caution as the included trials had a high risk of systematic error (bias). Further randomised clinical trials are needed to definitely understand the effect of physical exercise in adults after heart valve surgery. Given that the included studies are relatively old, and included narrowly-selected trial populations, the evidence is likely to be of limited applicability to clinical practice. Both trials had a high risk of bias (systematic errors) and the quality of the evidence was low. Due to the scarcity of the evidence there is also a high risk that the results may be subject to random errors (play of chance). Therefore, further high-quality randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the effects of exercise-based interventions."

Studies evaluated the interventions in various ways including whether it helped in any way a person's quality of life. There was inconclusive evidence that meditation and palliative care teams that involve a chaplain or spiritual counsellor help patients feel emotionally supported. The findings of the review are limited. This is because none of the studies measured whether the intervention helped the person cope with the disease process, and also it is unclear whether all participants receiving the palliative care team interventions were offered support from a chaplain.

One small study found that injecting the thoracic (upper back) sympathetic nerves with local anaesthetic and steroid was better than injecting the same drugs just under the skin at one-year follow-up, but the study may have been prone to bias. Only six studies reported on the type and amount of side effects. These studies reported only minor side effects, but since some studies did not report this information we can draw no firm conclusions about the safety of LASB.

Adverse events Adverse event data were available in four studies providing data on 1592 participants. None of the four comparisons showed clear differences in adverse events (Any substance or process that kills germs (bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that can cause infection and disease).) between treatment and comparison arms (very low-certainty evidence); for the comparison of antivirals plus corticosteroids (The cavity or channel within a tube or tubular organ such as a blood vessel or the intestine.) and corticosteroids (The cavity or channel within a tube or tubular organ such as a blood vessel or the intestine.) alone in studies at lower risk of bias, the RR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.69; 2 trials, N = 656; fixed-effect; very low-certainty evidence).

Eleven studies had high or uncertain risk of bias from various factors that can systematically affect trial results. We chose to base our conclusions only on data from three studies at a lower risk of bias. The review showed that there may be no clear difference in rates of incomplete recovery from Bell's palsy after treatment with the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids, compared to corticosteroids alone. This finding was of low certainty and was based on data from three trials involving 766 people with Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity. We excluded data from 10 trials with multiple potential sources of bias. However, we can be moderately confident that the combined therapy reduced the number of people left with long-term effects of Bell's palsy (excessive tearing of the eyes or an abnormal facial movement) compared to corticosteroid treatment alone. Data from two studies (98 participants) showed that in people with severe Bell's palsy (complete or almost complete facial paralysis), combined antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on recovery compared with corticosteroid treatment alone. Corticosteroids alone were more effective than antivirals alone on rates of incomplete recovery (667 participants, 2 trials); antivirals and corticosteroids combined were more effective than placebo or no treatment (658 participants, 2 trials); and there was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo (658 participants, 2 trials). Although, based on data from two trials (656 participants), we found no clear difference in the occurrence of side effects between people receiving both antivirals and corticosteroids, compared to those receiving corticosteroids alone, this evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions.

Mercier 1998 compared iNO versus control but allowed back-up treatment with iNO for infants who continued to satisfy the same criteria for severity of illness (A course or method of action selected to guide and determine present and future decisions.) after two hours. This trial enrolled both preterm and term infants but reported most results separately for the two groups. Ninos 1997 studied only infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. One trial compared iNO versus high-frequency ventilation (A continuing periodic change in displacement with respect to a fixed reference.) (Kinsella 1997).

Inhaled nitric oxide (One of the Indian Ocean Islands, east of Madagascar.) appears to have improved outcomes in hypoxaemic term and near-term infants by reducing the incidence of the combined endpoint of death or use of ECMO (The proportion of patients with a particular disease (Country located in southern Asia, between China and India.) during a given year per given unit of population.)

This reduction was due to a reduction in use of ECMO (The proportion of patients with a particular disease (Country located in southern Asia, between China and India.) during a given year per given unit of population.) (with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 5.3); mortality was not affected. Oxygenation was improved in approximately 50% of infants receiving iNO. The OI (bound to the carboxylic acid diethylglycine, with analgesic and antipyretic activities.) was decreased by a (weighted) mean of 15.1 within 30 to 60 minutes after the start of therapy, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) was increased by a mean of 53 mmHg. Whether infants had clear echocardiographic (A spasm of the diaphragm that causes a sudden inhalation followed by rapid closure of the glottis which produces a sound.) evidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN (A bacteria isolated from normal skin, intestinal contents, wounds, blood, pus, and soft tissue abscesses.)) did not appear to affect response to iNO. Outcomes of infants with diaphragmatic hernia were not improved; outcomes were slightly, but not significantly, worse with iNO (moderate-quality evidence). Infants who received iNO at less severe criteria did not have better clinical outcomes than those who were enrolled but received treatment only if their condition (Personality construct referring to an individual's perception of the locus of events as determined internally by his or her own behavior versus fate, luck, or external forces.) deteriorated. Fewer of the babies who received iNO early satisfied late treatment criteria, showing that earlier iNO reduced progression of the disease (Country located in southern Asia, between China and India.) but did not further decrease mortality nor the need for ECMO (The proportion of patients with a particular disease (Country located in southern Asia, between China and India.) during a given year per given unit of population.)

Six studies compared iNO started when babies were less sick against waiting to see if they deteriorated, then treating them later. These studies were smaller, and only one was a high-quality trial. Inhaled nitric oxide is safe and can help some full-term babies with respiratory failure who have not responded to other methods of support. Inhaled nitric oxide increases levels of oxygen in babies' blood, and babies are more likely to survive without needing ECMO, a highly invasive therapy with many complications. Unfortunately, benefits of iNO are not clear in babies whose respiratory failure is due to a diaphragmatic hernia. Inhaled nitric oxide has shown no short-term or long-term adverse effects. No signs suggest that iNO given earlier is more beneficial or results in more babies treated, and the number who die or who need ECMO is not significantly reduced."

In three studies (954 people), there was little or no difference in short-term pain reduction, overall improvement and return-to-work between those who used back supports and those who received manipulation, physiotherapy, or electrical stimulation. One study (164 people) reported mixed results on whether back supports improved function more than massage and in another study (19 people), use of a lumbar corset with back support was more effective in reducing pain in the short-term than a corset alone.

The total number of participants enrolled was unclear, as some studies (A benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property.) did not provide this information. Most studies (A benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property.) enrolled participants from the age of 18, including patients in intensive care units (ICU), oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (An ordered list of times at which things are planned to occur.).

Overall, catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBSI), with an ARR of 2% (95% CI 3% to 1%), RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.74) and NNTB of 50 (high-quality evidence).

However, catheter impregnation made no significant difference to the rates of clinically diagnosed sepsis (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to a suspicion of publication bias), all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07; high-quality evidence) and catheter-related local infections (The term was used in various ways in the past, to describe unintended effects of medical intervention, usually negative (unfavourable), but also positive (favourable) ones.)

For the outcome of catheter colonization, catheter impregnation conferred significant benefit in studies (A benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property.) conducted in ICUs (RR 0.70;95% CI 0.61 to 0.80) but not in studies (A benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property.) conducted in haematological and oncological units (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.11) or studies (A benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property.) that assessed predominantly patients who required CVCs for long-term total parenteral nutrition (An ordered list of times at which things are planned to occur.)

The magnitude of the effects was also not affected by the participants' baseline (The act of carrying into effect.) risks. There were no significant differences between the impregnated (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) and non-impregnated (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) groups in the rates of adverse effects, including thrombosis/thrombophlebitis (A set of cognitive functions that controls complex, goal-directed thought and behavior.), bleeding (An antibiotic produced by the soil actinomycete Streptomyces griseus.), erythema (A wound inflicted by the teeth or fangs of an individual or animal.) and/or tenderness at the insertion (A newborn infant greater than or equal to 37 weeks, 0 days and less than or equal to 41 weeks, 6 days gestational age.) site. This review confirms the effectiveness of antimicrobial CVCs in reducing rates of CRBSI and catheter colonization. However, the magnitude of benefits regarding catheter colonization varied according to setting, with significant benefits only in studies (A benzothiazolylpiperazine derivative and an atypical antipsychotic agent with an antischizophrenic property.) conducted in ICUs. A comparatively smaller body of evidence suggests that antimicrobial CVCs do not appear to reduce clinically diagnosed sepsis (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) or mortality significantly. Our findings call for caution in routinely recommending the use of antimicrobial-impregnated (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)

                "We included 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of antimicrobial impregnation. The total number of participants was not clear as some studies did not provide this information, and some participants may have had more than one CVC in the course of their treatment. The participants were mostly adults aged 18 and over in ICUs, cancer units or other healthcare settings in which CVCs were used for intravenous treatment or nutrition. All studies were completed when the participants left the unit or hospital, and no study followed up participants in the long-term. Twenty-six out of 57 studies were funded fully or partially by the catheter manufacturers or distributors, two studies were government-funded, and two received no funding. Funding sources were not stated in the remaining 27 studies. Compared to those participants given non-impregnated catheters, participants with impregnated catheters had 2% lower rates of bloodstream infections that were definitely catheter-related (CRBSI) (average absolute reduction in CRBSI: 2%). There was also a 9% lower chance of finding bacteria on these impregnated catheters (catheter colonization) (average absolute reduction in catheter colonization: 9%). However, the benefits of these catheters in reducing catheter colonization varied according to study setting, with significant benefits observed only in studies conducted in the ICUs. There were no clinically significant differences in the overall rates of bloodstream infections (clinically-diagnosed sepsis) or in death, although these outcomes were assessed in fewer studies than CRBSI and catheter colonization. Impregnated catheters appeared no more likely than non-impregnated catheters to cause adverse effects such as bleeding, clots, pain or redness at the insertion site. The amount of information in this review contributed to high-quality evidence for the major outcomes of CRBSI, all-cause mortality and adverse effects. However, for clinically-diagnosed sepsis we considered the quality of the evidence to be moderate, as we suspected that there had been selective non-publication of certain trials. We considered the quality of evidence to be moderate for catheter colonization too, due to major inconsistencies in the direction of the results amongst the included studies. While impregnated catheters are effective in reducing CRBSI and catheter colonization, particularly in ICUs, they may not be effective across all settings. Furthermore, our review shows that these impregnated catheters do not appear to reduce all bloodstream infections and numbers of deaths. The discrepancy between the findings for CRBSI, catheter colonization and overall bloodstream infections might be related to the limitations of the catheter and blood cultures that were used in most studies for detecting catheter-related infections. Future research should include overall bloodstream infections and death as key outcomes, and include some advanced methods for detecting micro-organisms on the catheters and in the bloodstream to evaluate the presence of catheter-related infections more accurately."

The interventions provided maternal education; nutrient supplementation of mothers, infants, and children; improving nutrition systems; or a combination of these but not dietary modification. The reliability of the studies was very low to moderate overall because studies were not designed to cope with research problems linked to urban slum communities, such as high mobility and high loss of participants to follow-up. This meant that the effectiveness of the intervention could not be properly assessed at later dates. We assessed the effect of interventions taking both statistical and clinical significance into account. Where intervention outcomes were statistically insignificant, we conclude there was 'unclear effect'. There was no effect of giving mothers nutrient supplementation on birth weight and length, there were inconclusive results for nutrient supplementation in infants and children on improving children's height or stunting status, there was a positive impact on birth weight of maternal education interventions where there was a positive difference in birth weight of 478 g in infants exposed to the intervention, and inconclusive results of improving health systems that support nutrition on children's stunting status and a positive effect on height. There were no reported side effects from these interventions.

Two RCTs (n = 381 IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)) were included in the review. One study (n = 159) compared etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo in IBD patients with quiescent or active ulcerative colitis (a variant vein draining the apical segment of the superior lobe of some left lung and emptying into some left superior pulmonary vein.) or Crohn's disease (Relating to or using sight; able to be seen.). The other study (n = 222) compared celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis (General or unspecified injuries to the neck.) (a variant vein draining the apical segment of the superior lobe of some left lung and emptying into some left superior pulmonary vein.). Both studies (The segment of LARGE INTESTINE between ASCENDING COLON and DESCENDING COLON.) were judged to be at low risk of bias. The two included studies (The segment of LARGE INTESTINE between ASCENDING COLON and DESCENDING COLON.) were not pooled for meta-analysis due to differences in patient populations and treatment duration. There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of IBD between etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) and placebo. After 12 weeks of treatment the IBD exacerbation rate was 17% (14/82) in the etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) group compared to 19% (15/77) in the placebo group (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.69). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (29 events). There was no statistically significant difference in exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (a variant vein draining the apical segment of the superior lobe of some left lung and emptying into some left superior pulmonary vein.) between celecoxib and placebo. After two weeks of treatment 4% (5/112) of celecoxib patients experienced an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (a variant vein draining the apical segment of the superior lobe of some left lung and emptying into some left superior pulmonary vein.) compared to 6% (7/110) of patients in the placebo group (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.14). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (12 events). The study comparing etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) to placebo documented but did not report on AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.). The proportion of patients who experienced AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively, P > 0.20). No patients in either group died or experienced serious adverse events (An enzyme that catalyzes the random hydrolysis of 1,4-linkages between N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronate residues in hyaluronate.). Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.07). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse data (24 events). GI AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) led to premature withdrawal from the study in 3% of patients in celecoxib and placebo groups respectively. GI AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) included increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding (Manipulation of the host's immune system in treatment of disease.), and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular adverse events (An enzyme that catalyzes the random hydrolysis of 1,4-linkages between N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronate residues in hyaluronate.). Renal (pumped and circulated through the body.) toxicity or thrombotic AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) were not reported. The results for disease exacerbation and AEs (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) between the COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) and placebo were uncertain. Thus no definitive conclusions regarding the tolerability and safety of the short term use of celecoxib and etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) in patients with IBD can be drawn. The two included studies (The segment of LARGE INTESTINE between ASCENDING COLON and DESCENDING COLON.) suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib (A basis of value established for the measure of quantity, weight, extent or quality, e.g.) do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies (The segment of LARGE INTESTINE between ASCENDING COLON and DESCENDING COLON.) had relatively small sample sizes and short follow-up durations. Clinicians need to continue to weigh the risks and benefits of these drugs (A person who produces food by growing plants or tending animals.) when treating patients IBD patients with rheumatological manifestations (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) in order to avoid disease exacerbation and other adverse effects.

One study (159 participants) compared etoricoxib (60 to 120 mg/day) to placebo (e.g. a sugar pill) in people with IBD (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) who were in remission (i.e. no disease symptoms) or had active disease (i.e. had symptoms). The other study (222 participants) compared 2 weeks of treatment with celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) to placebo in people with ulcerative colitis who were in remission. The study that compared etoricoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of IBD after 12 weeks of treatment. Although this study documented side effects experienced by the participants these side effects were not reported in the study manuscript. The study that compared celecoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of ulcerative colitis after two weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients who experienced side effects was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively). No patients in either group died or experienced serious side effects. Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI side effects including increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular side effects (i.e. heart attack or stroke). Renal toxicity (i.e. the poisonous effect of a substance on the kidneys) or thrombotic side effects (i.e. the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel) were not reported. The results of the two included studies in this review suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies assessed relatively small numbers of patients and were of short duration. Futhermore, the overall quality of the evidence from the studies was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results. No firm conclusions on the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib can be drawn from these studies.

At baseline (Conforming to facts, reality or definitive criteria.), six trials included only people with ulcers that were clinically infected (Recording of the changes in electric potential of muscle by means of surface or needle electrodes.); one trial included people with both infected and uninfected ulcers; two trials included people with non-infected ulcers; and the remaining 13 studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part) did not report infection (A weakening in force or intensity.) status. Included studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part) employed various topical antimicrobial treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.)

We performed the following five comparisons based on the included studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part): Antimicrobial dressings compared with non-antimicrobial (Small-scale tests of methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale if the pilot study demonstrates that these methods and procedures can work.) dressing (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy combination used to treat slow-growing forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).)s: Pooled data from five trials with a total of 945 participants suggest (based on the average treatment effect from a random-effects model) that more wounds may heal when treated with an antimicrobial dressing (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy combination used to treat slow-growing forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).) than with a non-antimicrobial (Small-scale tests of methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale if the pilot study demonstrates that these methods and procedures can work.) dressing (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy combination used to treat slow-growing forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).): risk ratio (RR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 1.45. These results correspond to an additional 119 healing events in the antimicrobial-dressing arm per 1000 participants (95% CI 51 to 191 more). We consider this low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice due to risk of bias). The evidence on adverse events or other outcomes was uncertain (very low-certainty evidence, frequently downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision).

(non dressings) compared with non-antimicrobial (Small-scale tests of methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale if the pilot study demonstrates that these methods and procedures can work.) topical treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.) (non dressings): There were four trials with a total of 132 participants in this comparison that contributed variously to the estimates of outcome data. Evidence was generally of low or very low certainty, and the 95% CIs (Describes a disease of unknown cause.) spanned benefit and harm: proportion of wounds healed RR 2.82 (95% CI 0.56 to 14.23; 112 participants; 3 trials; very low-certainty evidence); achieving resolution (Excision of the prepuce of the penis (FORESKIN) or part of it.) of infection (A weakening in force or intensity.)

Comparison of different topical antimicrobial treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.) (An abnormal growth located in the hilum of the lung.): We included eight studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part) with a total of 250 participants, but all of the comparisons were different and no data could be appropriately pooled. Reported outcome data were limited and we are uncertain about the relative effects of antimicrobial topical agents for each of our review outcomes for this comparison, that is wound healing, resolution (Excision of the prepuce of the penis (FORESKIN) or part of it.) of infection (A weakening in force or intensity.), surgical resection, and adverse events (all very low-certainty evidence). Topical antimicrobials (The proportion of patients with a particular disease during a given year per given unit of population.) compared with systemic antibiotics (The quantity of measurable virus in a body fluid.) : We included four studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part) with a total of 937 participants. These studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part) reported no wound-healing data, and the evidence was uncertain for the relative effects on resolution (Excision of the prepuce of the penis (FORESKIN) or part of it.) of infection (A weakening in force or intensity.) in infected ulcers and surgical resection (very low certainty). On average, there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events between the compared topical antimicrobial and systemic antibiotics (The quantity of measurable virus in a body fluid.) treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.): RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; moderate-certainty evidence - downgraded once for inconsistency). Topical antimicrobial agents compared with growth factor (The difference between the lowest and highest numerical values; the limits or scale of variation.): We included one study with 40 participants. The only review-relevant outcome reported was number of ulcers healed, and these data were uncertain (very low-certainty evidence).

(An abnormal growth located in the hilum of the lung.) for diabetic foot ulcers (Description:The patient has been admitted to a care facility and their community medications are suspended until hospital discharge.) is limited by the availability of relatively few, mostly small, and often poorly designed trials. Based on our systematic review and analysis of the literature, we suggest that: 1) use of an antimicrobial dressing (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy combination used to treat slow-growing forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).) instead of a non-antimicrobial (Small-scale tests of methods and procedures to be used on a larger scale if the pilot study demonstrates that these methods and procedures can work.) dressing (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy combination used to treat slow-growing forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).) may increase the number of diabetic foot ulcers (Description:The patient has been admitted to a care facility and their community medications are suspended until hospital discharge.) healed over a medium-term follow-up period (low-certainty evidence); and 2) there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse events related to treatment between systemic antibiotics (The quantity of measurable virus in a body fluid.) and topical antimicrobial treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.) (An abnormal growth located in the hilum of the lung.) based on the available studies (insufficient blood supply to a body part) (moderate-certainty evidence). For each of the other outcomes we examined there were either no reported data or the available data left us uncertain as to whether or not there were any differences between the compared treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.). Given the high, and increasing, frequency of diabetic foot wounds, we encourage investigators to undertake properly designed randomised controlled trials in this area to evaluate the effects of topical antimicrobial treatments (divided into large doses and treatments are given less than once a day.) (An abnormal growth located in the hilum of the lung.) for both the prevention (New abnormal growth of tissue.) and the treatment of infection (A weakening in force or intensity.) in these wounds and ultimately the effects on wound healing.",

                "In August 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials involving the use of any antimicrobial treatment on foot ulcers or other open wounds of the foot in people with diabetes. We found 22 trials involving a total of over 2310 adult participants (one trial did not report the number of participants). Participant numbers in each trial ranged from 4 to 317 and follow-up times during and after treatment ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. Some trials included participants with ulcers that were infected, while other trials included participants with ulcers that were uninfected. The trials compared a variety of different antimicrobial dressings, solutions, gels, creams, or ointments. Many of the trials did not report important data, which means the reliability of the results is uncertain. The results of five trials involving 945 participants suggest that use of some type of antimicrobial dressing may increase the number of ulcers healed in medium-term follow-up (4 to 24 weeks) when compared with a non-antimicrobial dressing (low certainty evidence). Due to limited information, we were unable to assess the effectiveness of treatments in either preventing or resolving wound infection. Four trials involving 937 participants compared systemic antibiotics (given by mouth or via injection, distributed to the whole body by the bloodstream) with antimicrobial treatments applied directly to the wound. These trials did not provide data on healing or infection, but it appeared that there was no difference in the side effects experienced by participants whose ulcers were treated systemically or topically (moderate certainty evidence). Overall, the certainty of the evidence provided by the trials was too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of topical antimicrobial treatments for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. More, larger, and better-designed randomised controlled trials should be carried out in this area."

Three reported no differences and no protective effect of vitamin A. Two studies reported that vitamin A significantly reduced the incidence of acute LRTI in children with poor nutritional status or weight, but increased the incidence in healthy children. This unexpected result is outside our current understanding of the use of vitamin A for preventing acute LRTIs. Accordingly, vitamin A should not be given to all children to prevent acute LRTIs. Despite its benefits in preventing diarrhoeal illnesses (The mass or quantity of heaviness of an individual at BIRTH.), vitamin A supplementation (A quantitative measurement of the amount of aspartate aminotransferase present in a sample of serum.) has only a limited effect in preventing acute LRTIs.

Most studies showed no significant benefit of vitamin A supplements on the incidence or prevalence of symptoms of acute LRTIs. Although no included studies addressed adverse effects of vitamin A, the use of vitamin A should be carefully monitored. We do not recommend giving vitamin A to all children to prevent acute LRTIs because a few studies unexpectedly found that vitamin A increased the chance of infections or worsened symptoms in otherwise healthy children.

Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) improved with treatment: Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 100 ml; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 40 to 160 ml. Similarly for forced vital capacity (FVC): WMD 210 ml 95%CI 100 to 320.

These benefits were seen in participants receiving a variety of different concomitant therapies (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.). Improvement in exercise performance depended on the method of testing.

Of note, seven studies (caused by some previous phenomenon.) used an egg avoidance diet as the control. Adverse events (An increased in a behavioral response to a repeated stimulus.) occurred in 4.2% of children, which may relate to accidental ingestion of egg-containing food. Three studies (caused by some previous phenomenon.) used a placebo (Visual impairment due to central nervous system dysfunction.) control with adverse events (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.) present in 2.6% of children. Overall, there was inconsistent methodological rigour in the trials. All studies (caused by some previous phenomenon.) enrolled small numbers of children and used different methods to provide oral immunotherapy (Surgical incision on the FASCIA.). Eight included studies (caused by some previous phenomenon.) were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Furthermore, the quality of evidence was judged to be low due to small numbers of participants and events, and possible biases. Frequent and increasing exposure to egg over one to two years in people who are allergic to egg builds tolerance, with almost everyone becoming more tolerant compared with a minority in the control group and almost half of people being totally tolerant of egg by the end of treatment compared with 1 in 10 people who avoid egg. However, nearly all who received treatment experienced adverse events (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.), mainly allergy-related. We found that 1 in 12 children had serious allergic reactions (A disorder characterized by an electrocardiographic finding of episodic atrial fibrillation with abrupt onset and termination.) requiring adrenaline, and some people gave up oral immunotherapy (Surgical incision on the FASCIA.). It appears that oral immunotherapy (Surgical incision on the FASCIA.) for egg allergy (A lesion on the surface of the skin or a mucous surface, produced by the sloughing of inflammatory necrotic tissue.) is effective, but confidence in the trade-off between benefits and harms is low; because there was a small number of trials with few participants, and methodological problems with some trials.",

The 10 studies included a total of 439 children (249 in the oral immunotherapy group (treatment containing egg) and 190 in the control group (no egg)) who were aged from 1 year to 18 years. The evidence showed that treating egg allergy by giving a small, increasing amount of egg may help most children with egg allergy to tolerate a partial serving of egg, so long as they continued to consume a daily amount of egg protein. Side effects were frequent during oral immunotherapy treatment, but were usually mild-to-moderate. Nevertheless, 21 of 249 children treated with oral immunotherapy for egg allergy required medicine because of a serious reaction. The studies did not report information about quality of life of children and their families during oral immunotherapy treatment. The trials involved small numbers and there were problems with the way they were done, therefore further research is needed."

No data on short term mortality were available. Two studies (A natural number greater than 6 and less than 8 and the quantity that it denotes: the sum of six and one.) reported data on adverse events after ILR implant.

Data from two trials seemed to show no difference in quality of life, although this finding (A cushion or support for the head or other body part; usually consisting of a cloth case surrounding a filler of feathers, down, plastic fibers, latex, rubber, or other foam material.) was not supported by a formal analysis due to the differences in both the scores used and the way the data were reported.

Cost analyses from two studies (A natural number greater than 6 and less than 8 and the quantity that it denotes: the sum of six and one.) showed higher overall mean costs in the ILR group, if the costs incurred by the ILR implant were counted. The mean cost per diagnosis (A set of statements describing a group of facts that clarifies the cause, context and/or consequence of those facts.) and the mean cost per arrhythmic diagnosis (A set of statements describing a group of facts that clarifies the cause, context and/or consequence of those facts.) were lower for participants randomised to ILR implant.

Our systematic review shows that there is no evidence that an ILR-based diagnostic strategy reduces long-term mortality as compared to a standard diagnostic assessment (very low quality evidence). No data were available for short-term all-cause mortality. Moderate quality evidence shows that an ILR-based diagnostic strategy increases the rate of aetiologic diagnosis (A set of statements describing a group of facts that clarifies the cause, context and/or consequence of those facts.) as compared to a standard diagnostic pathway. No conclusive data were available on the other end-points analysed. Further trials evaluating the effect of ILRs in the diagnostic strategy of people with recurrent unexplained syncope are warranted.

Loop recorders do not seem to change quality of life, although people with ILR had a significantly higher rate of diagnosis compared to participants in the standard assessment group. Moreover, data seem to show a trend towards a reduction in syncope recurrences after diagnosis in people implanted with ILR. Finally, costs were higher in the group of participants in which the ILR was implanted but the cost per diagnosis and the cost to diagnose an arrhythmia were much lower for participants randomised to ILR implant. There was low quality evidence that ILR does not change mortality if compared to a standard diagnostic assessment of people with syncope.

Participants were randomised to aspiration and sclerotherapy (155 patients with 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroceles). All studies (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection (A methylxanthine naturally occurring in some beverages and also used as a pharmacological agent.) bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions.

Three studies (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) reported the frequency of pain (Difficulty in initiating urination.) in the surgery group was higher than aspiration and sclerotherapy group but because of different measurement tools applied in these studies (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.), we could not pool the results. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.).

Postoperative complications (The lobe of the right lung situated below the oblique fissure.) as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration and sclerotherapy group; however the recurrence rate was higher. The cure rate in short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result due to the high heterogeneity. There is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different type of sclerosant agents, sclerosing solution concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles. It is important that the RCTs have sufficiently large sample size and long follow-up period.

Data analysed in this review showed that there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of proportion cough-free at two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 5.14). However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo (A getting back or regaining.) group (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.83, P = 0.02). The mean change in daytime cough diary scores from baseline (The periodic shedding of the ENDOMETRIUM and associated menstrual bleeding in the MENSTRUAL CYCLE of humans and primates.) was also better in the placebo (A getting back or regaining.) group compared to those on nebulised (Remain in force or carry on without letup; keep or maintain in unaltered condition; exist in time or space without stop or interruption.) rhDNase (The difference between the lowest and highest numerical values; the limits or scale of variation.), but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (MD 0.70; 95% CI -0.19 to 1.59).

There is currently an absence of evidence to support any of the therapies currently utilised for management of intrinsic tracheomalacia.

It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia. For those with less severe disease (Some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging.), RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics (A syndrome characterized by retropatellar or peripatellar PAIN resulting from physical and biochemical changes in the patellofemoral joint.) and chest physiotherapy are clearly needed. Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea (Products in capsule, tablet or liquid form that provide dietary ingredients, and that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of nutrients.) and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes.",

We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) which helps in breaking down the mucous and has been shown to be useful in aiding airway clearance in cystic fibrosis compared to placebo (no active treatment) in children with both tracheomalacia and a concurrent respiratory infection. This trial showed no evidence of benefit in terms of the number of children who were cough-free two weeks after treatment. Also, there was less coughing reported, both during the day and at night, in the group who did not receive the intervention - however these differences were not statistically significant. With the lack of evidence, the routine use of any therapies for intrinsic tracheomalacia cannot be recommended given the cost of nebulised rhDNase and the likely harmful effect. The decision to subject a child to any surgical or medical based therapies will have to be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for each individual situation. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia.

            "input": "We included 21 studies with 2658 randomised participants. All studies assessed the effectiveness of some form of psychological therapy. We found no studies that included physical therapy. Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (An indication of skeletal growth potential based on skeletal maturity indicators, such as radiologic imaging of growth plates.) (CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.)); the remainder evaluated behaviour therapies (The act of assuming or maintaining an erect upright position.), third-wave CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) (mindfulness), psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy. Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list. Five studies compared the intervention (A disease characteristic falling between acute and chronic, but predominantly acute.) to enhanced or structured care. Only one study compared cognitive behavioural therapy (An indication of skeletal growth potential based on skeletal maturity indicators, such as radiologic imaging of growth plates.) with behaviour therapy (Sterile collagen strands obtained from healthy mammals.). Across the 21 studies, the mean number of sessions ranged from one to 13, over a period of one day to nine months. Duration of follow-up varied between two weeks and 24 months. Participants were recruited from various healthcare settings and the open population. Duration of symptoms, reported by nine studies, was at least several years, suggesting most participants had chronic symptoms (no longer responding to treatment.) at baseline. Due to the nature of the intervention (A disease characteristic falling between acute and chronic, but predominantly acute.), lack of blinding of participants, therapists, and outcome assessors resulted in a high risk of bias on these items for most studies. Eleven studies (52% of studies) reported a loss to follow-up of more than 20%. For other items, most studies were at low risk of bias. Adverse events were seldom reported. For all studies comparing some form of psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list that could be included in the meta-analysis, the psychological therapy resulted in less severe symptoms at end of treatment (SMD -0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.16; 10 studies, 1081 analysed participants). This effect was considered small to medium; heterogeneity was moderate and overall quality of the evidence was low. Compared with usual care, psychological therapies (A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.) resulted in a 7% higher proportion of drop-outs during treatment (RR acceptability 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 14 studies, 1644 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Removing one outlier study reduced the difference to 5%. Results for the subgroup of studies comparing CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) with usual care were similar to those in the whole group. Five studies (624 analysed participants) assessed symptom severity comparing some psychological therapy with enhanced care, and found no clear evidence of a difference at end of treatment (pooled SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; considerable heterogeneity; low-quality evidence). Five studies (679 participants) showed that psychological therapies (A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.) were somewhat less acceptable in terms of drop-outs than enhanced care (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; moderate-quality evidence). When all psychological therapies (A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.) included this review were combined they were superior to usual care or waiting list in terms of reduction of symptom severity, but effect sizes were small. As a single treatment, only CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) has been adequately studied to allow tentative conclusions for practice to be drawn. Compared with usual care or waiting list conditions, CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) reduced somatic symptoms (Vaccines used to prevent infection by viruses in the family ORTHOMYXOVIRIDAE.), with a small effect and substantial differences in effects between CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) studies. The effects were durable within and after one year of follow-up. Compared with enhanced or structured care, psychological therapies (A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.) generally were not more effective for most of the outcomes. Compared with enhanced care, CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) was not more effective. The overall quality of evidence contributing to this review was rated low to moderate. The intervention (A disease characteristic falling between acute and chronic, but predominantly acute.) groups reported no major harms. However, as most studies did not describe adverse events (physical or mental disease that affects or limits the activities of daily living.) as an explicit outcome measure, this result has to be interpreted with caution. An important issue was that all studies in this review included participants who were willing to receive psychological treatment. In daily practice, there is also a substantial proportion of participants not willing to accept psychological treatments for somatoform disorders or MUPS. It is unclear how large this group is and how this influences the relevance of CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) in clinical practice. The number of studies investigating various treatment modalities (other than CBT (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.)) needs to be increased; this is especially relevant for studies concerning physical therapies. Future studies should include participants from a variety of age groups; they should also make efforts to blind outcome assessors and to conduct follow-up assessments until at least one year after the end of treatment.",

                "We rated the quality of current research as low to moderate. Fourteen out of the 21 studies focused on cognitive behavioural therapy, which is a specific form of talking therapy based on the idea that thoughts and thinking can influence emotions and behaviours. Cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than usual care in reducing the severity of MUPS. For other types of therapy, we found only one or two studies giving insufficient evidence for conclusions. Cognitive behavioural therapy was no more effective than enhanced care provided by the person's doctor. No studies of physical therapy met the criteria to be included in the review. Talking therapies were acceptable to people and few people dropped out of the trials; however, this may not reflect real clinical practice as the study participants were people with somatoform disorders or MUPS who were willing to try talking therapies. In clinical practice, a high proportion of people may not be willing to accept these treatments. The review authors suggest that future high-quality trials should be carried out to find out more about which groups of people benefit most from cognitive behavioural therapy and how it can be most effectively delivered. They also suggest that more studies are needed of other talking therapies, and a particular focus should be on high-quality studies of physical therapies."

Pooling data at three to 8 months after surgery from four RCTs favoured regional anaesthesia (Number of prior chemotherapy regimens: If a patient has received a chemotherapy regimen, provide the number of different single or multi agent chemotherapy regimens the patient has received.) after caesarean section (An irregular unpaired bone situated at the SKULL BASE and wedged between the frontal, temporal, and occipital bones (FRONTAL BONE; TEMPORAL BONE; OCCIPITAL BONE).) with an OR of 0.46, (95% CI 0.28 to 0.78; 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Evidence synthesis of three RCTs investigating continuous infusion (The process of giving birth to one or more offspring.) with local anaesthetic for the prevention of PPP (Reciprocal action or influence among people including parent-child, parent-teacher, and nurse-client.) three to 55 months after iliac crest bone graft harvesting (Agents used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.) (ICBG) was inconclusive (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.09; 123 participants, low-quality evidence). However, evidence synthesis of two RCTs also favoured the infusion (The process of giving birth to one or more offspring.) of intravenous local anaesthetics (A reduced or absent capacity to reproduce.) for the prevention of PPP (Reciprocal action or influence among people including parent-child, parent-teacher, and nurse-client.) three to six months after breast cancer (The uncritical acceptance of an idea or plan of action.) surgery with an OR of 0.24 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence). We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation (A thiourea antithyroid agent.), hernia repair (The positive effects of something.), cardiac surgery and laparotomy (An elevated level or position or degree; greater than normal in degree or intensity or amount.). We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.) did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered evidence synthesis. High risk of bias from missing data and lack of blinding across a number of included studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.) reduced our confidence in the findings. Thus results must be interpreted with caution. We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia (Number of prior chemotherapy regimens: If a patient has received a chemotherapy regimen, provide the number of different single or multi agent chemotherapy regimens the patient has received.) may reduce the risk of developing PPP (Reciprocal action or influence among people including parent-child, parent-teacher, and nurse-client.) after three to 18 months after thoracotomy and three to 12 months after caesarean section (An irregular unpaired bone situated at the SKULL BASE and wedged between the frontal, temporal, and occipital bones (FRONTAL BONE; TEMPORAL BONE; OCCIPITAL BONE).). There is low-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia (Number of prior chemotherapy regimens: If a patient has received a chemotherapy regimen, provide the number of different single or multi agent chemotherapy regimens the patient has received.) may reduce the risk of developing PPP (Reciprocal action or influence among people including parent-child, parent-teacher, and nurse-client.) three to 12 months after breast cancer (The uncritical acceptance of an idea or plan of action.) surgery. There is moderate evidence that intravenous infusion (The process of giving birth to one or more offspring.) of local anaesthetics (A reduced or absent capacity to reproduce.) may reduce the risk of developing PPP (Reciprocal action or influence among people including parent-child, parent-teacher, and nurse-client.) three to six months after breast cancer (The uncritical acceptance of an idea or plan of action.) surgery. Our conclusions are considerably weakened by the small size and number of studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.), by performance bias, null bias, attrition and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.), including children, are needed. We caution that except for breast surgery, our evidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.). On a cautionary note, we cannot extend our conclusions to other surgical interventions (A system of words used in a particular discipline.) or regional anaesthesia (Number of prior chemotherapy regimens: If a patient has received a chemotherapy regimen, provide the number of different single or multi agent chemotherapy regimens the patient has received.) techniques, for example we cannot conclude that paravertebral block (higher than the standard dosage levels recommended on the product labeling for that chemotherapeutic agent.) reduces the risk of PPP (Reciprocal action or influence among people including parent-child, parent-teacher, and nurse-client.) after thoracotomy. There are seven ongoing studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.) and 12 studies (An iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity.) awaiting classification that may change the conclusions of the current review once they are published and incorporated.",

We found 63 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants undergoing open chest, heart, breast, abdominal, vascular, gynaecological and other surgery, but not orthopaedic surgery. RCTs are studies where people are allocated by chance to one or the other of different treatments being studied. The studies included only adults, and were mostly conducted in Europe and North America, with some from China, Egypt and Brazil. The types of surgery included surgery with a high event rate of persistent pain after surgery, such as breast surgery, limb amputation and opening the chest, and surgery with a lower risk but high numbers of procedures, such as caesarean section. We were able to pool results from 39 RCTs enrolling a total of 3027 participants for our inclusive analysis. Follow-up was for 1293 participants at three months, 1365 participants at six months, 326 participants at 12 months, and 43 participants at 20 or more months after surgery. The RCTs did not report surgical and anaesthetic complications consistently and little information was available on these. The studies were mostly funded by the institutions conducting the studies. Regional anaesthesia reduced the number of people who experienced persistent pain after undergoing non-orthopaedic surgery. For open chest surgery, giving an epidural halved the odds of a person having persistent postoperative pain at three to 18 months after surgery (7 RCTs, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Seven people needed to be treated in this way for one to benefit. For the prevention of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery, seven people needed regional anaesthesia for one to benefit (18 RCTs, 1297 participants, low-quality evidence). Infusion of local anaesthetic into a vein was shown to reduce the risk of persistent pain three to six months after breast surgery (2 RCTs, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with three people needing to be treated for one to benefit. Regional anaesthesia reduced the odds by more than half of a woman experiencing persistent pain after caesarean section (4 RCTs, 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). The number of women treated for one to benefit was 19. Continuous local anaesthetic infusion of the site where bone tissue was obtained from the hip bone did not clearly reduce the number of people with persistent pain at three to 55 months (3 RCTs, 123 participants, low-quality evidence). We could not synthesize evidence for limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac or abdominal surgery because of differences in how treatment was given or how results were reported. We found consistent evidence supporting the use of regional anaesthesia in adults to prevent persistent pain after a number of types of surgery. However, we observed variations in the effect sizes, and at different times after surgery. Some studies could not be blinded to the treatment received and our results are affected by the small number of studies and participants, and the loss to follow-up of participants over time. The evidence was therefore of low or moderate quality."

                "Available studies tested the effects of antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabiliser treatment in BPD. In addition, the dietary supplement omega-3 fatty acid (commonly derived from fish) which is supposed to have mood stabilising effects was tested. Twenty-eight studies covering 1742 study participants were included. The findings tended to suggest a benefit from using second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but most effect estimates were based on single study effects so repeat studies would be useful. Moreover, the long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed. The small amount of available information for individual comparisons indicated marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. The data also indicated that there may be an increase in self-harming behaviour in patients treated with olanzapine. In general, attention must be paid to adverse effects. Most trials did not provide detailed data of adverse effects and thus could not be considered within this review. We assumed their effects were similar to those experienced by patients with other conditions. Available data of the studies included here suggested adverse effects included weight gain, sedation and change of haemogram parameters with olanzapine treatment, and weight loss with topiramate. Very few beneficial effects were identified for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, they may be helpful in the presence of comorbid problems that are not part of BPD core pathology, but can often be found in BPD patients. There are only few study results per drug comparison, with small numbers of included participants. Thus, current findings of trials and this review are not robust and can easily be changed by future research endeavours. In addition, the studies may not adequately reflect several characteristics of clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods)."

The prevalence of severe fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.) in a subgroup of survivors of haematological cancer was presented in seven studies (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) and ranged from 1.8% to 35.9% (1907 survivors). Prevalence of severe fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.) in brain cancer (The time it takes to reach REM SLEEP.) survivors was presented in two studies (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.)

In these four studies (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.), survivors were more often fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.)d than controls, but this difference was statistically significant in only two studies (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.). Studies assessing risk and associated factors for fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.) were heterogeneous, and definitions of the factors under study were often inconsistent, with results therefore presented descriptively.

In contrast, age at diagnosis (Injury to any of the cranial nerves or their nuclei in the brain resulting in muscle weakness.) and education level did not seem to be associated with fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.). We were unable to calculate any overall risk estimate for any of the reported risks and associated factors, because we could not conduct meta-analysis.

The evidence in this review is therefore weak, and the exact prevalence of severe fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.) after treatment for childhood cancer (considered a norm.) remains to be determined. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.) following treatment and the strength of the relationship between fatigue (The influence that produces a change in a physical quantity; physical energy or intensity.) and associated and risk factors.

Four studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue in the patient's brothers and sisters or in population-based controls. Prevalence rates in these control groups ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%.

When we looked at the prevalence of severe fatigue in survivors of lymphoma and leukaemia (types of blood cancers), we found that they ranged from 1.8% to 35.9%. Two studies reported on severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors, with rates of 21.13% and 14.6%. One study in bone cancer survivors reported no cases of severe fatigue.

By contrast, in studies including participants aged 16 years and over (but mostly over 18), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. Twenty-two studies assessed one or more possible risk factors for fatigue. Our review shows that depression might increase fatigue. The age at cancer diagnosis and the education level of the survivor did not seem to influence fatigue. Only one study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. All included studies had problems with the quality of the evidence, and we found many differences between studies for several characteristics. The evidence to address our review question is therefore weak. The occurrence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains uncertain.

Our findings suggest that if the chance of live birth with placebo is assumed to be 15%, the chance following supplementation would be between 7% and 31%, and that if the chance of clinical pregnancy with placebo is assumed to be 24%, the chance following treatment with supplementation would be between 23% and 47%. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in the multiple-pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. Neither of the studies reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) or side-effects. Thus, the safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI cycles (until the day of oocyte retrieval) is unclear due to the small number of studies and low event rates. Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on the live birth rate. The evidence was rated as low or very low quality for all outcomes, mainly due to imprecision, with low sample sizes and few events."

Seven trials compared standard-dose rhGH (approximately 0.3 mg/kg/week) to no treatment and one three-arm trial (63 participants) compared placebo, standard-dose rhGH (0.3 mg/kg/week) and high-dose (Used with organs, animals, and higher plants and with diseases for microbiologic studies.) rhGH (0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes but there was no difference between standard and high-dose (Used with organs, animals, and higher plants and with diseases for microbiologic studies.) levels (low-quality evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low- to low quality evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard-dose rhGH versus no treatment (very low-quality evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis of diabetes (actually getting which specific treatment.) in the trials of short duration (low-quality evidence). There is low- to very low-quality evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations with no further significant adverse effect (One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.)s, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low-quality evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low-quality evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs. When compared with no treatment, rhGH therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass. Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials. The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes (actually getting which specific treatment.), emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect (One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.) with therapy in a population predisposed to CF-related diabetes (actually getting which specific treatment.). No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or side-effects (The act of making a selection among two or more alternatives, usually after a period of deliberation.) were observed in this review due to the small number of participants.

It includes eight trials with 291 individuals with CF being selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The individuals in the trials were five to 23 years old, but most had not yet reached puberty. Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. Treatment with rhGH was compared to no treatment in seven trials and to a placebo (a liquid that did not contain any growth hormone) in one trial. The trial that used a placebo compared it to two different doses of rhGH treatment. Results showed a modest improvement in height, weight and lean body mass between six and 12 months. However, there was no consistent evidence that rhGH treatment improves lung function, muscle strength, or quality of life. The trials were small and we did not find any evidence on changes in glucose metabolism or the long-term risk of diabetes due to the treatment. Given these results, we are not able to identify any clear benefit of therapy and believe that more research from well-designed, adequately powered clinical trials is needed. We did not have enough information to decide if overall the trials were biased in a way that might affect the results. All the measured outcomes were clearly reported in the trials, but the trials were small, and did not have enough participants to show a difference that may not have been due to chance. We also had concerns that outcomes which were based on personal judgement, such as quality of life scores, might be affected because those taking part in seven of the trials were able to tell which group they were in."

Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. For continued exposure, 56 per 1000 workers reported absence of symptoms at follow-up, the decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of a reference value (FEV1 (Postoperative morbidity in patients recovering from general anesthesia where a depressed neuromuscular response due to residual PARESIS continues beyond a defined ANESTHESIA RECOVERY PERIOD.) %) was 5.4% during follow-up, and the standardized change in non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (NSBH) was -0.18.

In seven studies (The chemical reactions and pathways involving glucocorticoids, hormonal C21 corticosteroids synthesized from cholesterol.), authors compared reduction of exposure to continued exposure. Reduction of exposure may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 2.65 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.68). There may be no considerable difference in FEV1 (Postoperative morbidity in patients recovering from general anesthesia where a depressed neuromuscular response due to residual PARESIS continues beyond a defined ANESTHESIA RECOVERY PERIOD.) % between reduction and continued exposure, with MD 2.76 % (95% CI -1.53 to 7.04) . No studies (The chemical reactions and pathways involving glucocorticoids, hormonal C21 corticosteroids synthesized from cholesterol.) reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH. In ten studies (The chemical reactions and pathways involving glucocorticoids, hormonal C21 corticosteroids synthesized from cholesterol.), authors compared removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure to reduction of exposure. Following removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure there may be no increase in the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 6.05 (95% CI 0.86 to 42.34), and improvement in symptoms, with RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.47), as well as no considerable change in FEV1 (Postoperative morbidity in patients recovering from general anesthesia where a depressed neuromuscular response due to residual PARESIS continues beyond a defined ANESTHESIA RECOVERY PERIOD.) %, with MD 2.58 % (95% CI \u22123.02 to 8.17). However, with all three outcomes, there may be improved results for removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure in the subset of patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. No studies (The chemical reactions and pathways involving glucocorticoids, hormonal C21 corticosteroids synthesized from cholesterol.) reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH. In two studies (The chemical reactions and pathways involving glucocorticoids, hormonal C21 corticosteroids synthesized from cholesterol.), authors reported that the risk of unemployment after removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure may increase compared with reduction of exposure, with RR 14.28 (95% CI 2.06 to 99.16). Four studies (The chemical reactions and pathways involving glucocorticoids, hormonal C21 corticosteroids synthesized from cholesterol.) reported a decrease in income of 20% to 50% after removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure. The quality of the evidence is very low for all outcomes. Both removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure and reduction of exposure may improve asthma (An article or book published after examination of published material on a subject.) symptoms (To devise, contrive, or form in design.) compared with continued exposure. Removal (The process by which two or more parties work jointly towards a common goal.) from exposure, but not reduction of exposure, may improve lung function compared to continued exposure. When we compared removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure directly to reduction of exposure, the former may improve symptoms and lung function more among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. Removal (The process by which two or more parties work jointly towards a common goal.) from exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment. Care providers should balance the potential clinical benefits of removal (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) from exposure or reduction of exposure with potential detrimental effects of unemployment.

                "The review is based on 26 studies that included 1,695 participants with occupational asthma. Sensitizers caused nearly all cases. We focused on the interventions of removal from exposure and reduction of exposure, which were compared with continued exposure. Outcomes were changes in asthma symptoms, lung function, and non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity between baseline and follow-up. What are the main results of the review? Both removal from exposure and reduction of exposure may improve asthma symptoms when compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure, but not reduction of exposure, may improve lung function when compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure may improve symptoms and lung function more than reduction of exposure among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents, but removal may also increase the risk of unemployment. Consequently, the benefit of a better improvement has to be weighed against the potential for a higher risk of job loss. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of interventions at reducing the impact of occupational asthma. How up-to-date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published through 31July 2019."

Very few data were available to make a conclusion regarding long-term benefits and harms of PPI reduction or discontinuation. Overall, the quality of evidence for this review ranged from very low to moderate. Trials were inconsistent with how they reported symptom control.

Resolution of tophi - 33 more people out of 100 had resolution of one or more tophi after six months' treatment with pegloticase biweekly compared with placebo (33% absolute improvement). - 14 more people out of 100 had resolution of one or more tophi after six months' treatment with pegloticase monthly compared with placebo (14% absolute improvement). - 40 people out of 100 in the biweekly pegloticase group had resolution of one or more tophi. - 21 people out of 100 in the monthly pegloticase group had resolution of one or more tophi. - 7 people out of 100 in the placebo group had resolution of one or more tophi. Other outcomes were for all participants, and not separated out for those people with tophi. Therefore, we have not reported them in this review. However, we reported on withdrawal due to adverse events for the total population. Most withdrawals were due to adverse reactions to drug infusion. Withdrawal due to adverse events - 16 more people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with biweekly pegloticase compared with placebo (16% more withdrawals). - 17 more people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with monthly pegloticase compared to placebo (17% more withdrawals). - 18 people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with biweekly pegloticase due to adverse events. - 19 people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with monthly pegloticase due to adverse events. - 2 people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with placebo due to adverse events. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that pegloticase biweekly or monthly probably resolves one or more tophi. However, this has to be weighed up against high withdrawal rates from treatment due to adverse events, mostly due to an increase in infusion reactions. Pain reduction, quality of life, serum urate normalisation and function were not reported separately in people with tophi. The evidence was downgraded due to imprecise results. Further research may change these results. We do not know if other interventions, including surgery, are effective, as we found no randomised controlled trials that assessed other interventions."

Treatment was started either in the first 24 hours following birth (two small studies) or following commencement of oral feeding (enteral) (one large well-controlled study). In this large study, infants generally received breast milk, whereas they received formula milk in the other two studies. Giving immunoglobulin (IgG alone or IgG plus IgA combination) did not reduce the incidence of NEC, need for surgery related to NEC or death from NEC, either during or after the study period. Immunoglobulins could possibly cause breakdown of red blood cells (called haemolysis) (red blood cells are common cells in the blood that delivery oxygen to organs), but no clinically important haemolysis was apparent. There were no other reported side effects. There was low-very low evidence for all the major outcomes. The major factor that affected the quality of evidence was the lack of precision in the result estimates, as the calculated plausible range of the effects (the 95% confidence intervals) were wide."

Four trials compared platinum based combination chemotherapy directly with radiotherapy. Indiscriminate pooling of survival data from 2197 women shows a significant overall survival advantage from adjuvant chemotherapy (usually regular and done with the intention of improving or maintaining PHYSICAL FITNESS or HEALTH.) (RR (95% CI) = 0.88 (0.79 to 0.99)). Sensitivity analysis focused on trials of modern platinum based chemotherapy regimens (Used with diseases for therapeutic interventions except drug therapy, diet therapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, for which specific subheadings exist.) and found the relative risk of death to be 0.85 ((0.76 to 0.96); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT (The surgical removal of one or both ovaries.)) = 25; absolute risk reduction = 4% (1% to 8%)). The HR for overall survival is 0.74 (0.64 to 0.89), significantly favouring the addition of postoperative platinum based chemotherapy. The HR for progression-free survival is 0.75 (0.64 to 0.89). This means that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any censorship by a quarter. Chemotherapy (A broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic similar to AMPICILLIN except that its resistance to gastric acid permits higher serum levels with oral administration.) reduces the risk of developing the first recurrence outside the pelvis (continuous with the wall of pulmonary vein.) (RR = 0.79 (0.68 to 0.92), 5% absolute risk reduction; NNT (The surgical removal of one or both ovaries.) = 20). The analysis of pelvic (The mass or quantity of heaviness of an individual at BIRTH.) recurrence rates is underpowered but the trend suggests that chemotherapy may be less effective than radiotherapy in a direct comparison (RR = 1.28 (0.97 to 1.68)) but it may have added value when used with radiotherapy (RR = 0.48 (0.20 to 1.18)). Postoperative platinum based chemotherapy is associated with a small benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival irrespective of radiotherapy treatment. It reduces the risk of developing a metastasis, could be an alternative to radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy.",

                "Womb (uterine/endometrial) cancer is a fairly common disease affecting approximately 1 in 70 women. A hysterectomy is usually curative because most cancers have a low risk of spreading (metastasising) to other sites which may result in a later recurrence. Microscopic examination of the hysterectomy specimen can tell doctors if there is a high risk of the cancer returning and this allows women to decide if they want further preventative treatment (adjuvant therapy) to reduce the risk. Chemotherapy can increase cure rates for other types of high-risk cancer after initial surgery and this review examines the effectiveness of chemotherapy for primary womb cancer after hysterectomy. Data from nine high quality randomised clinical trials involving up to 2197 women were subjected to systematic statistical modelling. This shows that chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent disease, lengthens the duration women have before a metastasis is diagnosed and improves survival rates. There are many ways to examine the data. The subset analysis that excluded old fashioned drug regimens suggests that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any nominated time by a quarter. The number of women who would need to have need chemotherapy to prevent one death depends on the type of cancer. In these trials, one woman was cured for every 25 women treated with high dose platinum based chemotherapy after hysterectomy. This is an absolute risk reduction of 4%. Chemotherapy is associated with a greater survival advantage than radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy. It also appears to reduce the absolute risk of developing a recurrence outside the pelvis by about 5%. This would benefit one woman in every 20 treated. However, chemotherapy has side effects, risks and temporarily reduces a woman's quality of life. In many cases, the small reduction in the cancer recurrence risk may not be worth the side effects of adjuvant treatment."

                "This is a summary of a Cochrane review that looked at the effect of using one of these drugs, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We gathered evidence from 12 trials involving 1319 participants. The evidence is current to July 2013. For patients who have never had eye surgery before, 5-FU injections after surgery can slightly reduce the pressure in the eye after one year and also the risk of having more surgery in the first year. For patients having both cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery at the same time, no difference has been detected between injections and no injections. Some people are at higher risk of having problems following trabeculectomy, for instance people that have had previous surgery on the eye. For this group, the 5-FU injections can reduce the pressure in the eye a little and also reduce the risk of having more surgery in the first year. Only one study has investigated the effect of using lower than normal doses in the injections. No benefit was found when compared to a control group who had no injections. If 5-Fluorouracil was applied to the eye during the surgery, there was less chance of having to have more surgery within the year and the pressure in the eye was also reduced slightly at one year. Complications such as damage to cells at the front of the eye or a leak from the wound seem more common when 5-FU is used. The methodological quality of the trials was not high in general. In many of the studies that contributed to the evidence about 5-FU after glaucoma surgery the researchers were aware of whether the participant had received the dummy injection or the 5-FU injection. This may have introduced bias into the results. Importantly the only study contributing information about low dose 5-FU was of low methodological quality so our conclusions on low dose 5-FU must be cautious. The studies that contributed evidence about 5-FU during surgery was largely very good, the studies were designed and reported to a standard we would expect of modern trials. We concluded that the main benefit is for people at high risk of problems. There may be a smaller benefit for people at low risk of problems if 5-FU is given either as injections after surgery or during the operation. However, 5-FU was found to increase the risk of serious complications and so may not be worthwhile for the small benefit gained."

In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia (A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei.) was increased in the ICS group compared to placebo (A scraping away of thin sections), in studies that reported pneumonia (A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei.) as an adverse event (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years. Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV1 (The act of giving information, suggestion, or recommendation to a group or individual.)) against the potential side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness, and risk of pneumonia (A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei.)).",

However, when RIFLE-R urine output based outcomes were excluded as per study protocol, the direction of AKI (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) risk again favoured the other fluid type, with a non-significant RR of AKI (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) in HES treated patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.14; 8445 patients).

The IQCODE can be used to identify older adults in the general hospital setting who are at risk of dementia (Abuse of children in a family, institutional, or other setting.) and require specialist assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline (The unborn young of a viviparous mammal, in the postembryonic period, after the major structures have been outlined.).

Of these papers, six (1352 participants) described studies conducted in \u201cspecialist\u201d services such as memory clinics or wards. Three papers (566 participants) described studies conducted in general older adult services and four studies (827 participants) included both specialist and general services. Summarising the available papers, we found that IQCODE was useful for 'ruling out' possible dementia in the general hospital setting. This means if a person has a low score on IQCODE testing they probably do not have dementia. IQCODE was less useful in specialist memory clinics and psychiatry wards. We also found that a short version of the IQCODE gave similar results to the traditional longer version. As part of our assessment we looked at whether the design of the available studies was suitable for the study question. We found several instances where the design of the study could be improved. For example, seven of the thirteen studies only included a selection of all the people attending the service who could have been assessed with IQCODE. We also looked at how well researchers reported the conduct and results of their studies. Again, there were many instances where the reporting could be improved. A common issue was not describing the severity of memory and thinking problems in those thought to have dementia, only reported in three of the included studies. In summary, IQCODE may be a useful tool for assessing adults for possible dementia. There are still a number of unanswered questions around how useful IQCODE may be in hospital settings. For example, before we start using IQCODE routinely we need to describe if it is practical and acceptable to hospital staff, to patients and to their carers. The review was performed by a team based in research centres in the UK (Glasgow, Leicester, Oxford). We had no external funding specific to this study and we have no conflicts of interest that may have influenced our assessment of the research data."

Comparing studies (One of a pair of irregularly shaped bones that form the upper jaw.) was difficult as there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the studies (One of a pair of irregularly shaped bones that form the upper jaw.) and in their selection criteria. There was no information regarding health-related quality of life, complications of diabetes (A symptom or state of reduced quality or strength.), cost or health service utilisation, mortality and limited evidence on adverse events (Lateral displacement of the great toe (HALLUX), producing deformity of the first METATARSOPHALANGEAL JOINT with callous, bursa, or BUNION formation over the bony prominence.)

                "We identified 15 publications (10 studies) looking at 1019 patients who were followed between three months to 10 years. We found many of the publications had poor quality of reporting and had small numbers of participants. However, there does seem to be evidence from this review that the drug sulphonylurea (like glibenclamide or glyburide, gliclazide) could make patients insulin dependent sooner and it does not control blood sugar as well as insulin. Therefore, this suggests that this drug should not be a first line treatment for patients with LADA. In addition, insulin combined with vitamin D, or Chinese herbs may maintain natural insulin production better than insulin alone. Similarly, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) may maintain natural insulin production. However, there was no conclusive evidence that any of the other remaining treatment methods were better than each other. Studies on oral agents or insulin reported no adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic attacks. This review represents very early days of our understanding of the best way to treat LADA. It is limited by the poor reporting quality of the studies, small sample sizes, no clear single definition of LADA and many of the studies being carried out in different ethnic groups (China, Japan, Cuba, UK, Sweden) with different clinical care systems.  None of the publications reported on complications of diabetes, health-related quality of life, costs or health service utilisation. All but one of the publications reported there were no deaths.  In summary, this review demonstrates that insulin treatment may be preferable compared to sulphonylurea treatment but there is little evidence regarding other forms of treatment. Future studies are needed, should have a clear definition of LADA, investigate patient-important outcomes and use a common method of measuring stimulated C-peptide (a marker of natural insulin production reflecting improved beta-cell function of the pancreas)."

We were interested mainly in studies with a follow-up period of four or more months to assess whether any effects were sustained beyond the immediate short term. In 43 of the trials, the social norms intervention was targeted at higher-risk students. 55 trials were conducted in the USA, with others form Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Delivery of social norms information included mailed feedback, web/computer feedback, individual face-to-face feedback, group face-to-face feedback and general social norms marketing campaigns across college campuses. Over the longer-term, after four or more months of follow-up, there was only a small effect of social norms information on binge drinking, drinking quantity, and peak BAC. For these outcomes, effects were not any different across the different delivery modes.Only small effects were found for web feedback and individual face-to-face feedback on frequency of alcohol consumed. Only a small effect of individual face-to-face feedback on alcohol related problems, but no effects were found for mailed or web feedback. Similarly, no effects were found for group face-to-face feedback or for marketing campaigns on frequency of alcohol consumed and typical BAC. Our reading of these results is that, although we found some significant effects of social norms information, the strength of the effects over the longer-term is very small and therefore this information is unlikely to provide any advantage in practice. Overall, only low or moderate quality evidence was noted for the effects reported in this review. Problems with study quality could result in estimates of social norms effects that are too high, so we cannot rule out the chance that the effects observed in this review may be overstated. The U.S. National Institutes of Health provided funding for just under half (33/70) of the studies included in this review. Eighteen studies provided no information about funding, and only 13 papers had a clear conflict of interest statement."

Eighteen studies investigated proximity interventions. Most (14/18) changed the distance at which a snack food or drink was placed from the participants, whilst four studies changed the order of meal components encountered along a line.

However, it is highly unlikely that a definitive placebo-controlled trial will ever be conducted, and, therefore, on the basis of results from a single case-control study, a four-week regimen (Research criteria established for defining Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) families as established by the International Collaborative Group (ICG) meeting in Amsterdam in 1990: 1.) of PEP should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion. There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral regimen (Research criteria established for defining Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) families as established by the International Collaborative Group (ICG) meeting in Amsterdam in 1990: 1.)s following occupational exposure to HIV. However, due to the success of combination therapies in treating HIV-infected individuals, a combination of antiretroviral drugs (usually brief intensive educational program for a relatively small group of people that focuses especially on techniques and skills in a particular field.) should be used for PEP. Healthcare workers should be counseled about expected adverse events and the strategies for managing these. They should also be advised that PEP is not 100% effective in preventing HIV seroconversion. A randomized controlled clinical trial is neither ethical nor practical. Due to the low risk of HIV seroconversion, a very large sample size would be required to have enough power to show an effect. More rigorous evaluation of adverse events, especially in the developing world, are required. Seeing that current practice is partly based on results from individual primary animal studies, we recommend a formal systematic review of all relevant animal studies.",

                "This review evaluated the effects of antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for preventing HIV infection following occupational exposure. No randomized controlled trials were identified. Only one case-control study provides evidence for using zidovudine monotherapy. The study found that, in the occupational setting, HIV transmission was significantly associated with deep injury, visible blood on the sharp instrument, procedures involving a needle placed in the source patient's blood vessel, and terminal illness in the source patient. After taking these into account, it was found that those who became infected with HIV had significantly lower odds of having taken zidovudine after exposure, compared to those who did not seroconvert. There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral regimens following occupational exposure to HIV. However, due to the success of combination therapies in treating HIV-infected individuals, a combination of drugs should be used for PEP. Eight reports from other studies confirmed the findings that adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen; however, discontinuation rates were not significantly different. A four-week regimen of post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion.

The two main types of psychological treatment are called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and behaviour therapy. Both focus on helping people to change behaviour that maintains or worsens pain, disability, distress and catastrophic thinking; CBT also directly addresses the thoughts and feelings that are a problem for people with persistent pain. The effects of these two treatments on pain, disability, mood and catastrophic thinking were tested immediately after the treatment, and six months later. Small to moderate benefits, more for disability, mood and catastrophic thinking than for pain, were found in trials which compared CBT with no treatment. Some of these were still positive six months later. Behaviour therapy showed few and only brief benefits. Psychological therapies can help people with chronic pain reduce negative mood (depression and anxiety), disability, catastrophic thinking, and in some cases, pain. Although the overall effect is positive, we do not know enough about exactly which type of treatment is best for which person."

            "input": "We reviewed a total of 881 full-text documents. From these, we identified 15 national initiatives, including more than 260,000 people, that met the inclusion criteria. None of the initiatives were provided in lower-middle-income or low-income countries. All initiatives except one used an uncontrolled pre-post study design. Because of high levels of study heterogeneity (I2 > 90%), we focused on individual initiatives rather than on pooled results. Ten initiatives provided sufficient data for quantitative analysis of impact (64,798 participants). As required by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, we graded the evidence as very low due to the risk of bias of the included studies, as well as variation in the direction and size of effect across the studies. Five of these showed mean decreases in average daily salt intake per person from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.), ranging from 1.15 grams/day less (Finland) to 0.35 grams/day less (Ireland). Two initiatives showed mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.): Canada (1.66) and Switzerland (0.80 grams/day more per person); however in both countries the pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) data point was from several years prior to the initiation of the intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.). The remaining initiatives did not show a statistically significant mean change. Seven of the 10 initiatives were multi-component and incorporated intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) activities of a structural nature (e.g. food product reformulation, food procurement policy in specific settings). Of those seven initiatives, four showed a statistically significant mean decrease in salt intake from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.), ranging from Finland to Ireland (see above), and one showed a statistically significant mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) (Switzerland; see above). Nine initiatives permitted quantitative analysis of differential impact by sex (men and women separately). For women, three initiatives (China, Finland, France) showed a statistically significant mean decrease, four (Austria, Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom) showed no significant change and two (Canada, United States) showed a statistically significant mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.). For men, five initiatives (Austria, China, Finland, France, United Kingdom) showed a statistically significant mean decrease, three (Netherlands, Switzerland, United States) showed no significant change and one (Canada) showed a statistically significant mean increase in salt intake from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.). Information was insufficient to indicate whether a differential change in mean salt intake occurred from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) by other axes of equity included in the PROGRESS framework (e.g. education, place of residence). We identified no adverse effects of these initiatives. The number of initiatives was insufficient to permit other subgroup analyses, including stratification by intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) type, economic status of country and duration (or start year) of the initiative. Many studies had methodological strengths, including large, nationally representative samples of the population and rigorous measurement of dietary sodium intake. However, all studies were scored as having high risk of bias, reflecting the observational nature of the research and the use of an uncontrolled study design. The quality of evidence for the main outcome was low. We could perform a sensitivity analysis only for impact. Population-level intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.)s in government jurisdictions for dietary sodium reduction have the potential to result in population-wide reductions in salt intake from pre-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) to post-intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.), particularly if they are multi-component (more than one intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) activity) and incorporate intervention (dictated by privacy policies intended to engender trust in a service provider.) activities of a structural nature (e.g. food product reformulation), and particularly amongst men. Heterogeneity across studies was significant, reflecting different contexts (population and setting) and initiative characteristics.

                "We searched research papers and government reports and had direct communication with individuals working in salt reduction in their respective countries. The evidence is current as of 5 January 2015, when we last searched electronic databases. Initiatives in 15 countries met the inclusion criteria. Ten of these countries provided sufficient data for quantitative analysis, gathered from studies that included 64,798 participants. Initiatives ranged from one activity (e.g. in Japan, which at the time of writing had a public information campaign) to many activities (e.g. in the United Kingdom, which provided five activities including on-package nutrition information, restrictions on marketing to children and food product reformulation). Of the 15 countries that met inclusion criteria, seven provided information about funding source, of which six reported non-industry funding. The other eight countries did not report a funding source for one or more data point(s). Five of the 10 countries included in the quantitative analysis (China, Finland, France, Ireland and England) showed a decrease in salt intake after the intervention. Two of the 10 countries (Canada, Switzerland) showed an increase in salt intake after the intervention, however, in both countries the only data available were from several years prior to the intervention starting. Because the initiatives were very different, we cannot present an overall finding of whether these types of initiatives work. When we focused on the subset of seven countries whose salt reduction initiatives included multiple components and were not focused solely on educating the public, we found that more than half (four of seven) showed a decrease in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention. When we examined the nine initiatives that analysed men and women separately, we found that amongst men, more than half (five of nine) showed a decrease in salt intake after the intervention. Amongst women, the pattern of findings was less clear, with three of nine interventions showing a decrease, two showing an increase and four showing no change in salt intake. Low-bias study designs, such as randomised controlled trials, typically are not suitable for evaluating complex initiatives such as these; therefore, we rated all of the studies included in this review as having low methodological quality. Large nationally representative samples of the population and careful measurement of dietary sodium intake were strengths of several studies. However, because of study design limitations, the trustworthiness of study results is not clear. Overall, our results show that national government initiatives have the potential to achieve population-wide reductions in salt intake, especially amongst men, and particularly if they employ more than one strategy and include structural activities such as food product reformulation (i.e. food companies putting less salt in food products). The wide variation of results across the studies we found presents a challenge in interpreting the current evidence and this warrants more research to help us understand this."

The results for most comparisons were uncertain because of statistical imprecision. One study reported that clonidine reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage and increased the second stage of sleep. However, results for other sleep-related outcomes with clonidine were uncertain.

Clonidine was associated with prolonged morning hypotension in three of 16 participants. The use of preventive medication avoided any adverse effects in people treated with levodopa (Clotting time of PLASMA mixed with a THROMBIN solution.) and bromocriptine.

This showed a lower level of reporting for open questions (O) compared to checklists (CL), with a range for the risk ratios of 0.12 to 0.64. This review supports concerns that methods to elicit participant-reported AEs influence the detection of these data. There was a risk for under-detection of AEs in studies (The persistence to perform a learned behavior (facts or experiences) after an interval has elapsed in which there has been no performance or practice of the behavior.) using a more general elicitation method compared to those using a comprehensive method. These AEs may be important from a clinical perspective or for patients. This under-detection could compromise ability to pool AE data. However, the impact on the nature of the AE detected by different methods is unclear. The wide variety and low quality of methods to compare elicitation strategies limited this review. Future studies (The persistence to perform a learned behavior (facts or experiences) after an interval has elapsed in which there has been no performance or practice of the behavior.) would be improved by using and reporting clear definitions and terminology for AEs (and other important variables), frequency and time period over which they were ascertained, how they were graded, assessed for a relationship to the study drug, coded, and tabulated/reported. While the many potential AE endpoints in a trial may preclude the development of general AE patient-reported outcome measurement instruments, much could also be learnt from how these employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand data elicited. Any chosen questioning method needs to be feasible for use by both staff and participants.",

                "Clinical drug trials or studies are usually conducted to assess how well the drug works but also whether it causes any harm (side effects or adverse effects). Adverse effects can be detected by the trial doctor examining participants or taking some blood samples or doing other kinds of tests. The trial staff can also ask participants about how they are feeling after taking the trial drug. However, the way participants are asked about their health can vary from trial to trial, or even within a trial. In some trials, participants may be asked a simple open question such as 'how have you been feeling?', while in other trials, participants may be asked about whether they have had any of a long list of possible symptoms (such as 'have you had a headache, stomach ache, or sore muscles?'). There has been concern that these different kinds of questions and how they are phrased will impact on what participants report about their health during a trial. This might then affect the trial's results and what we know about the side effects of drugs. We did this review to look at studies that compared different types of participant questioning methods in order to investigate these issues. We found 33 studies comparing mainly open questions with checklist-type questions, but also some ratings scales and participant interviews. While the studies were all very different in terms of the types of disease, drugs, and patients studied, we found in general that, as would be expected, when a more specific type of question was asked (like a checklist), participants reported more symptoms. What is interesting is that, in those studies that looked more closely at the types of symptoms reported, it seems that an open question picks up the more severe or bothersome symptoms compared to a checklist-type question. However, some studies found that even quite severe or bothersome symptoms were not reported when a participant is asked an open question and these severe symptoms will only be reported with the more specific question. This makes it difficult to say whether one method is better than any other and the different questioning methods may, in fact, be complementary and therefore should be used together. It is also difficult to say what a specific question should include, as it might take too long for a participant to have to answer a very long list. While more research is needed to resolve the remaining uncertainties, it is very important for trials to be clear about which kind of questioning was used when they publish their results. This will help readers understand the trial's findings about the side effects and make it easier to make accurate comparisons between trials."

One study was of parallel design with the remaining six being cross-over in design; participant numbers ranged from 17 to 75. The total study duration varied between four days and two years. The age of participants ranged between seven and 63 years with a wide range of disease (A general term for the complete loss of the ability to hear from both ears.) severity reported. Six studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) enrolled participants who were clinically stable, whilst participants in one study had been hospitalised with an infective exacerbation. All studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) compared autogenic drainage to one (or more) other recognised airway clearance technique. Exercise is commonly used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis (form and structure of an organism or one of its parts.); however, there were no studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) identified comparing exercise with autogenic drainage. The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low. The main reasons for downgrading the level of evidence were the frequent use of a cross-over design, outcome reporting bias and the inability to blind participants. The review's primary outcome, forced expiratory volume in one second, was the most common outcome measured and was reported by all seven studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.); only three studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) reported on quality of life (also a primary outcome of the review). One study reported on adverse events and described a decrease in oxygen saturation levels (A device designed to convert a liquid to a mist.) whilst performing active cycle of breathing techniques, but not with autogenic drainage. Six of the seven included studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) measured forced vital capacity and three of the studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) used mid peak expiratory flow (per cent predicted) as an outcome. Six studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) reported sputum weight. Less commonly used outcomes included oxygen saturation levels (A device designed to convert a liquid to a mist.), personal preference, hospital admissions or intravenous antibiotics (Feelings or emotions of dread, apprehension, and impending disaster but not disabling as with ANXIETY DISORDERS.). There were no statistically significant differences found between any of the techniques used with respect to the outcomes measured except when autogenic drainage was described as being the preferred technique of the participants in one study over postural drainage (a tendency for the occurrence of THROMBOSIS.) and percussion (Agents used to treat RETROVIRIDAE INFECTIONS.). Autogenic drainage (A small lump, swelling or collection of tissue.) is a challenging technique that requires commitment from the individual. As such, this intervention merits systematic review to ensure its effectiveness for people with cystic fibrosis (form and structure of an organism or one of its parts.). From the studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) assessed, autogenic drainage was not found to be superior to any other form of airway clearance technique. Larger studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) are required to better evaluate autogenic drainage in comparison to other airway clearance techniques in view of the relatively small number of participants in this review and the complex study designs. The studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) recruited a range of participants and were not powered to assess non-inferiority. The varied length and design of the studies (Replacement of the SHOULDER JOINT.) made the analysis (A primary or metastatic malignant tumor involving the prostate gland.) of pooled data challenging.",

                "We searched the literature for studies comparing at least two sessions of autogenic drainage with other breathing techniques and devices which help to clear the lungs of mucus. We included seven studies in the review involving 208 people with cystic fibrosis, aged between seven and 63 years of age. People were selected for one physiotherapy treatment or the other randomly. The number of people in the studies ranged from 17 to 75, and had a wide range of disease severity. The studies lasted from four days to two years in total. We did not find any clear evidence that autogenic drainage was better than the other techniques for lung function or quality of life in either the short-term or long-term studies. This was also true for our other outcome measures such as hospital admissions, additional antibiotic treatment, exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation, but in one study autogenic drainage was the preferred technique compared to postural drainage and percussion. Exercise was identified as a comparator for airway clearance by the authors of this review but no included studies used it in this way, even though it is often used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis. Overall, the quality of the evidence from the studies was judged to be mainly low or very low. The main problems for this being the small numbers of participants in each study, the unclear reporting of results in the studies and the study design used. In one study, which was classed as having a high risk of bias due to incomplete results, those taking part had to change physiotherapy technique halfway through the study and there were many who dropped out and did not comply with the postural drainage and percussion treatment arm. Five of the seven studies used research staff to assess results who did not know which technique each person was using and this improved the quality of the evidence and reduced any bias."

The review included 25 studies, with a total of 1305 participants. All the studies used a CBT approach, and compared CBT against treatment as usual or waiting list (13 studies), or against another psychological therapy (12 studies). The review showed that people attending for psychological therapy based on a CBT approach were more likely to have reduced anxiety at the end of treatment than people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for therapy. CBT was also very effective in reducing secondary symptoms of worry and depression. People who attended for group CBT and older people were more likely to drop out of therapy. None of the studies comparing CBT with treatment as usual or waiting list looked at the long-term effectiveness of CBT. It is not clear whether people attending for CBT sessions were more likely to have reduced anxiety than people attending for psychodynamic therapy or supportive therapy, because only one study compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, and the six studies that compared CBT with supportive therapy showed differing results. None of the studies included in the review reported on the possible side effects or acceptability of psychological therapies. More studies should be carried out to establish whether psychodynamic and supportive therapies are effective for GAD, and whether CBT is more helpful than other psychological therapy approaches in treating GAD."

The palliative care (A form of therapy that employs a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those experiencing pain.) plan (The tissue of the liver.) was more likely to be available on discharge in the intervention group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75). We found no evidence that the intervention affected mortality in hospital (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13), decisions to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (The study of the origin, nature, properties, and actions of drugs and their effects on living organisms.) in hospital or the clinical care provided during hospital admission, but for the latter, event rates were low and the results were associated with a lot of uncertainty. One cluster RCT (256 participants, each enrolled with a family carer) evaluated the effect of a decision aid on end-of-life feeding options on surrogate decision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Data for 90 participants (35% of the original study) met the definition of advanced dementia for this review and were re-analysed for the purposes of the review. In this subset, intervention surrogates had lower scores for decisional conflict measured on the Decisional Conflict Scale (mean difference -0.30, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.01, reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units considered meaningful) and were more likely than participants in the control group to discuss feeding options with a clinician (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64), but imprecision meant that there was significant uncertainty about both results. Very little high quality work has been completed exploring palliative care (A form of therapy that employs a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those experiencing pain.) interventions in advanced dementia. There were only two included studies (A response format that has two possible responses (e.g.,Yes/No, True/False, Agree/Disagree).) in this review, with variation in the interventions and in the settings (A potent benzodiazepine receptor antagonist.) that made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis of data for any outcome. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care (A form of therapy that employs a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those experiencing pain.) interventions in advanced dementia. The fact that there are six ongoing studies (A response format that has two possible responses (e.g.,Yes/No, True/False, Agree/Disagree).) at the time of this review indicates an increased interest in this area by researchers, which is welcome and needed.",

                "We examined the research published up to January 2016. We found only two suitable studies (189 people), both from the US. We also found six studies that were underway but the results were not yet published. One study found that having a small team of doctors and nurses trained in palliative care made little difference to how people with advanced dementia were treated while in hospital. But, having this special team meant that more people had a palliative care plan when they were discharged from hospital. The other study measured if giving written information to relatives explaining the different methods that can be used to feed people with advanced dementia helped either the relatives or the person. This study found that giving relatives this information made it a little easier for relatives to make decisions about what methods would be used to feed the person with dementia. We only found two studies and the two palliative care methods in these studies were very different. We cannot be very certain about how accurate either of these results reported here are, partly because only a small number of people took part in the studies. So from these studies, it is hard to be sure whether palliative care makes a difference to people with advanced dementia. Little research has been done about people with advanced dementia, often because of ethical concerns. However, although it is hard to do research with people with dementia, more well-designed studies are required to work out how palliative care can be used best in this special population."

We were able to include three randomised trials. Two of these, with 853 women, assessed radiotherapy and chemotherapy given at the same time versus chemotherapy given first followed by radiotherapy. The third trial randomised 244 women to radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The evidence produced by these three well-conducted trials suggests that recurrence of a woman's cancer and her chances of dying from breast cancer are similar regardless of the order of the treatments, provided that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are commenced within seven months of the surgery. The trials provided limited information regarding adverse events, side effects or quality of life associated with the different sequences of treatment. The limited evidence available does suggest that the frequency and severity of side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are similar regardless of which sequence is used. However, it should be noted that the women in these trials were treated, on average, in the early 2000s. As a result, the trials do not assess the modern types of radiotherapy, and new types of chemotherapy (such as taxanes) or other drugs (such as Herceptin). We will add relevant trials that include these more recent treatments to future updates of this review."

However, in order to find out if CrP (Bleeding from a PEPTIC ULCER that can be located in any segment of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) works in general, we also analysed the effect of all pooled CrP (Bleeding from a PEPTIC ULCER that can be located in any segment of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) doses versus placebo (The action of obtaining something by payment.) on body weight only. Across all CrP (Bleeding from a PEPTIC ULCER that can be located in any segment of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) doses investigated (200 \u00b5g, 400 \u00b5g, 500 \u00b5g, 1000 \u00b5g) we noted an effect on body weight in favour of CrP (Bleeding from a PEPTIC ULCER that can be located in any segment of the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.) of debatable clinical relevance after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment: mean difference (MD) -1.1 kg (95% CI -1.7 to -0.4); P = 0.001; 392 participants; 6 trials; low-quality evidence (GRADE)).

Two participants receiving placebo (The action of obtaining something by payment.) discontinued due to adverse events (An archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, east of the Cook Islands.); one event was reported as serious. No study reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects.

We were unable to find good evidence that this potential weight loss effect increased with increasing dose of chromium picolinate. Only three of nine studies provided information on adverse events, so we were unable to determine whether chromium picolinate supplements are safe and whether any potential harms may increase with dose. In addition, the length of studies included was rather short (maximum of 24 weeks), so we were unable to determine any long-term effects of supplementation. No study reported whether supplementation was associated with increases in deaths from any cause or illnesses (such as myocardial infarction or stroke), or the health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects of supplementation. The overall quality of evidence was considered low and we have inadequate information from which to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of chromium picolinate supplementation in overweight or obese adults."

These evaluated a range of comparisons in a range of surgical wounds healing by secondary intention (Marked by sudden change.). In general studies (Remembrance of information for a few seconds to hours.) were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors (The linear extent in space from one end of something to the other end, or the extent of something from beginning to end.) reduced the quality of the evidence. Two comparisons compared different iodine preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatments. The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One study compared a zinc oxide (agent that selectively inhibits ion flux through its channel.) mesh dressing (administered for therapeutic or preventive purposes.) with a plain mesh dressing (administered for therapeutic or preventive purposes.). There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics (Anti-inflammatory agents that are non-steroidal in nature.)) which favoured the zinc oxide (agent that selectively inhibits ion flux through its channel.) group. This was low quality evidence. One study reported that sucralfate cream (The process of giving birth to one or more offspring.) increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy (An article or book published after examination of published material on a subject.) compared to a petrolatum cream (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three week period. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality. The study also reported lower wound pain (not primarily designed to replace teeth.) scores in the sucralfate group (Compounds that inhibit HMG-CoA reductases.).

Again estimates came from one small study with 40 participants. There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies (Remembrance of information for a few seconds to hours.) with small participant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence.

Studies looked at wounds after diabetic foot amputation, pilonidal sinus surgery, treatment of various types of abscess, surgery for haemorrhoids, complications after caesarean section and healing of openings created by operations such as colostomy. Most studies compared a range of different types of antibacterial treatments to treatments without antibacterial activity, but four compared different antibacterial treatments. Although some of the trials suggested that one treatment may be better than another, this evidence was limited by the size of the studies and the ways they were carried out and reported. All of the studies had low numbers of participants and in some cases these numbers were very small. Many of the studies did not report important information about how they were carried out, so it was difficult to tell whether the results presented were likely to be true.

Two trials of computer-assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed- and immediate- memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well-being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed-, immediate- and verbal-memory, self-reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta-analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well-being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to 0.83; I2= 67%) or two months post-intervention (SMD - 0.21, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.47; I2 = 63%) or on mental well-being two months post-intervention (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.34; I2 = 67%). Lower mental well-being immediately post-intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait-list controls (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.16; I2 = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be low quality and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear. Overall, the, albeit low-quality evidence may be interpreted to suggest that non-pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment. Larger, multi-site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach.

We found that salbutamol and insulin-dextrose were effective in reducing potassium levels in the blood. We found that salbutamol was effective whether it was given intravenously or by nebuliser. Those treatments appeared to be more effective than other treatments such as sodium bicarbonate and aminophylline. None of the studies found any serious adverse reactions to the medications. Overall, the quality of evidence was assessed as poor because the studies were small in size and the methods for how the studies were performed were not well described.

Antimicrobial lock solutions (Encouraging consumer behaviors most likely to optimize health potentials (physical and psychosocial) through health information, preventive programs, and access to medical care.) probably reduces CRI per 1000 catheter-days (27 studies (Educational institutions.): RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.53; I2 = 54%; low certainty evidence), however antimicrobial lock solutions probably makes little or no difference to the risk of thrombosis per 1000 catheter days (14 studies (Educational institutions.): RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22; I2 = 83%; very low certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis of antibiotic and the combination of both lock solutions showed that both probably reduced CRI per 1000 catheter-days (13 studies (Educational institutions.): RR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.42; I2 = 47%) and risk of thrombosis per 1000 catheter-days (4 studies (Educational institutions.): RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.49; I2 = 0%), respectively.

Antibiotic (A small lump, swelling or collection of tissue.) antimicrobial and combined (antibiotic-non antibiotic) lock solutions decreased the incidence of CRI compared to control lock solutions, whereas non-antibiotic (Abnormally dilated veins of the esophagus.) lock solutions reduce CRI only for tunnelled CVC. The effect on thrombosis incidence is uncertain for all antimicrobial lock solutions.

Studies measured the incidence of CRIs and catheter thrombosis, or both. Overall quality of the studies was low for CRIs and very low for thrombosis. There was no information on funding sources for most of the studies. In general antimicrobial lock solutions are likely superior to standard solutions in preventing CRIs among patients undergoing HD through a CVC, but non-antibiotic solutions did not prove to reduce CRI. They are no worse than heparin at preventing thrombosis. Other adverse effects were not reported in most studies. Our confidence in these results is low due to the quality of the studies. Some antimicrobial (antibiotic and the combination of antibiotic-non antibiotic) lock solutions decrease the incidence of CRIs compared to heparin. Their effect on CVC permeability remains unclear.

Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (63%) were male.

We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of the active cycle of breathing technique on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference. Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a cross-over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review. All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the self-reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function. Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups. Over half of the studies checked that participants were using the airway clearance therapy they were supposed to. Most of the studies reported on all their planned outcomes.

Some studies found effects in favour of the telephone follow-up intervention, but overall studies identified no statistically significant differences between the telephone follow-up and control groups. For as far as the results of studies could be pooled together, we could draw no firm conclusions about the effects of telephone follow-up. No studies identified adverse effects of the intervention."

            "input": "We identified 38 eligible retention trials. Included trials evaluated six broad types of strategies to improve retention. These were incentives, communication strategies, new questionnaire format, participant case management, behavioural (Naturally occurring or synthetic substances that inhibit or retard oxidation reactions.) and methodological interventions. For 34 of the included trials, retention was response to postal and electronic questionnaires with or without medical test kits. For four trials, retention was the number of participants remaining in the trial. Included trials were conducted across a spectrum of disease area (Institutions which provide medical or health-related services.)s, countries, healthcare and community settings. Strategies that improved trial retention were addition of monetary incentives compared with no incentive for return of trial-related postal questionnaires (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.28, P value < 0.0001), addition of an offer of monetary incentive compared with no offer for return of electronic questionnaires (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.38, P value < 0.00001) and an offer of a GBP20 voucher compared with GBP10 for return of postal questionnaires and biomedical test kits (RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.22, P value < 0.005). The evidence that shorter questionnaires are better than longer questionnaires was unclear (RR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P value = 0.07) and the evidence for questionnaires relevant to the disease/condition was also unclear (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14). Although each was based on the results of a single trial, recorded delivery of questionnaires seemed to be more effective than telephone reminders (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.87, P value = 0.02) and a 'package' of postal communication strategies with reminder letters appeared to be better than standard procedures (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67, P value < 0.0001). An open trial design also appeared more effective than a blind trial design for return of questionnaires in one fracture prevention trial (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.63, P value = 0.0003). There was no good evidence that the addition of a non-monetary incentive, an offer of a non-monetary incentive, 'enhanced' letters, letters delivered by priority post, additional reminders, or questionnaire question order either increased or decreased trial questionnaire response/retention. There was also no evidence that a telephone survey was either more or less effective than a monetary incentive and a questionnaire. As our analyses are based on single trials, the effect on questionnaire response of using offers of charity donations, sending reminders to trial sites and when a questionnaire is sent, may need further evaluation. Case management and behavioural (Naturally occurring or synthetic substances that inhibit or retard oxidation reactions.) strategies used for trial retention may also warrant further evaluation. Most of the retention trials that we identified evaluated questionnaire response. There were few evaluations of ways to improve participants returning to trial sites for trial follow-up. Monetary incentives and offers of monetary incentives increased postal and electronic questionnaire response. Some other strategies evaluated in single trials looked promising but need further evaluation. Application of the findings of this review would depend on trial setting, population, disease area (Institutions which provide medical or health-related services.), data collection and follow-up procedures.",

                "This review identified methods that encouraged people to stay in trials. We searched scientific databases for randomised studies (where people are allocated to one of two or more possible treatments in a random manner) or quasi-randomised studies (where allocation is not really random, e.g. based on date of birth, order in which they attended clinic) that compared methods of increasing retention in trials. We included trials of participants from any age, gender, ethnic, cultural, language and geographic groups. The methods that appeared to work were offering or giving a small amount of money for return of a completed questionnaire and enclosing a small amount of money with a questionnaire with the promise of a further small amount of money for return of a filled in questionnaire. The effect of other ways to keep people in trials is still not clear and more research is needed to see if these really do work. Such methods are shorter questionnaires, sending questionnaires by recorded delivery, using a trial design where people know which treatment they will receive, sending specially designed letters with a reply self addressed stamped envelope followed by a number of reminders, offering a donation to charity or entry into a prize draw, sending a reminder to the study site about participants to follow-up, sending questionnaires close to the time the patient was last followed-up, managing peoples' follow-up, conducting follow-up by telephone and changing the order of questionnaire questions. The methods that we identified were tested in trials run in many different disease areas and settings and, in some cases, were tested in only one trial. Therefore, more studies are needed to help decide whether our findings could be used in other research fields."

We identified six cross-over studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and data related to the first treatment period for the other five studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) were not yet available. Seven included studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) provided data related to the primary outcome, and eight studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) provided data related to more than one secondary outcome. Our analysis was hampered by the fact that a large proportion of the included studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) reported no events in either study arm. No studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) reported significant differences between device (Taking ambient air into the lungs; breathing in.)s in relation to the primary review outcome: failure to adequately mechanically ventilate. We evaluated this outcome by assessing two variables: inadequate oxygenation (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.31; four studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.), N = 617) and inadequate ventilation (not estimable; one study, N = 80).

Peak airway (The formation or presence of a blood clot (THROMBUS) within a vein.) pressure during positive pressure ventilation was lower in cLMA participants (MD 0.84, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.67; P = 0.04; I\u00b2 = 0%; four studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.), N = 259).

The quality of evidence for all outcomes, as assessed by GRADE score, is low mainly owing to issues related to blinding and imprecision. Data show no important differences between device (Taking ambient air into the lungs; breathing in.)s with regard to failure to insert the device (Taking ambient air into the lungs; breathing in.), use of an alternate device (Taking ambient air into the lungs; breathing in.), mucosal injury, sore throat, bronchospasm (Fractures of the FEMUR HEAD; the FEMUR NECK; (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURES); the trochanters; or the inter- or subtrochanteric region.), gastric insufflation, regurgitation, coughing (A relational factor in counseling that includes three dimensions: goal consensus between counselor and client, collaboration on counseling-related tasks, and emotional bonding.), and excessive leak. Data were insufficient to allow estimation of differences for obstruction (A pyrethroid insecticide commonly used in the treatment of LICE INFESTATIONS and SCABIES.) related to the device (Taking ambient air into the lungs; breathing in.). None of the studies (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) reported postoperative nausea and vomiting (A metric unit of volumetric flow rate defined as the rate at which one milliliter of matter crosses a given surface during the period of time equal to one second.) as an outcome. We are uncertain about the effects of either of the airway (The formation or presence of a blood clot (THROMBUS) within a vein.) device (Taking ambient air into the lungs; breathing in.)s (Persons traveling on foot.) in terms of failure of oxygenation or ventilation because there were very few events. Results were uncertain in terms of differences for several complications (The leakage of body fluid or cells from the vascular system to the surrounding tissues.). Low-quality evidence suggests that the ProSeal laryngeal (A range of values for a variable of interest, e.g., a rate, constructed so that this range has a specified probability of including the true value of the variable.) mask airway (The formation or presence of a blood clot (THROMBUS) within a vein.) makes a better seal and therefore may be more suitable than the Classic laryngeal (A range of values for a variable of interest, e.g., a rate, constructed so that this range has a specified probability of including the true value of the variable.) mask airway (The formation or presence of a blood clot (THROMBUS) within a vein.) for positive pressure ventilation. The Classic laryngeal (A range of values for a variable of interest, e.g., a rate, constructed so that this range has a specified probability of including the true value of the variable.) mask airway (The formation or presence of a blood clot (THROMBUS) within a vein.) may be quicker to insert, but this is unlikely to be clinically meaningful.",

                "We included eight randomized studies that involved a total of 829 participants 18 years of age and older. All participants had elective surgeries and needed general anaesthesia. Researchers directly compared cLMA against pLMA for providing artificial breathing during surgery. We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and five other studies are gathering data related to the first treatment period that are not yet available. Five studies did not report any funding sources. Of the remaining three studies, one reported that the Laryngeal Mask Company sponsored some data but was not involved in study design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. The Joseph Drown Foundation, in Los Angeles, Califiornia, in the USA, partially supported another study. One of the authors of the final study had received research funds from Intavent Ltd, manufacturer of both types of laryngeal mask airway, but Intavent Ltd did not sponsor this study. We are unsure whether these devices exhibit important differences in providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation because there was not enough data to enable us to draw any firm conclusions. ProSeal laryngeal mask airway may provides a better seal because it leaks at higher pressure, but Classic laryngeal mask airway may be quicker to insert. However, these findings are not important clinically. We assessed all of the included studies as providing low-quality evidence because anaesthetists knew which device was being used on which participants (although this was probably unavoidable), and because it was unclear whether the investigator who collected the data was unaware of the intervention. This fact created the potential for bias."

            "input": "We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.) were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome (A mass in the mammary gland, either mobile or immobile.). The studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.) fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.)), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.)), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides (Compounds that provide LUBRICATION between surfaces in order to reduce FRICTION.), disaccharides (Drugs used to prevent SEIZURES or reduce their severity.), monosaccharides (A substance being studied in the treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)ment of certain solid tumors, lymphoma, and myeloma.) and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study). We found that children treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)ed with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention (Human immunodeficiency virus.) than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.15; 7 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.); 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. We found that children treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)ed with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention (Human immunodeficiency virus.) than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.); 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).) for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. Children with a symptom profile (A number or range of numeric values measuring performance, function, quality, or ability.) defined as irritable bowel syndrome (A mass in the mammary gland, either mobile or immobile.) treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)ed with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention (Human immunodeficiency virus.) than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.); 344 children). Children treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)ed with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention (Human immunodeficiency virus.) compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.); 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.). We found that children treat (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)ed with fibre-based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention (Human immunodeficiency virus.) than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.); 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.); 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible. We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.) included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. With the exception of one study, all studies (An decreased concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the blood.) reported monitoring children for adverse events (The amount of three dimensional space occupied by an object or the capacity of a space or container.); no major adverse events (The amount of three dimensional space occupied by an object or the capacity of a space or container.) were reported. Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profile (A number or range of numeric values measuring performance, function, quality, or ability.)s, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome (A mass in the mammary gland, either mobile or immobile.). We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions (oils derived from plants or plant products.) are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations.",

All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. Probiotics We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias. Fibre supplements We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality. Low FODMAP diets We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP. Fructose-restricted diets We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose-restricted diets in children with RAP. We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best. We did not find convincing evidence that fibre supplements are effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Future larger, high-quality studies are needed to test the effectiveness of fibre and low FODMAP diet treatments."

Odds ratios (OR) for the two studies (A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).)

The 19 trials (n = 3176) with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.), at the three following time periods: -0.38 (immediate), -0.38 (1 week to 2 months) and -0.49 (6 to 9 months). SMDs for prejudice outcomes across all studies (A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).) ranged from -2.94 (95% CI -3.52 to -2.37) to 2.40 (95% CI 0.62 to 4.18). The median SMDs indicate that mass media intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.)s may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice, and are equivalent to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with schizophrenia (Around the time of surgery.) to that associated with major depression (First aid or other immediate intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) for accidents or medical conditions requiring immediate care and treatment before definitive medical and surgical management can be procured.). The studies (A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).) were very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.)s and outcomes, and only two meta-analyses within two subgroups were warranted. Data on secondary outcomes were sparse. Cost data were provided on request for three studies (A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).) (n = 416), were highly variable, and did not address cost-effectiveness. Two studies (A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).) (n = 455) contained statements about adverse effects and neither reported finding any. Mass media intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.)s may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes. Our review found few studies (A glycoprotein hormone secreted by the adenohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, ANTERIOR).) in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents. The findings are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.)s on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps about types of mass media not covered in this review.

Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income countries and 15 low-income countries, in rural, urban and semi-urban locations. We developed 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context (11 findings, five moderate- or high-confidence); service design and provision (24 findings, 15 moderate- or high-confidence); and what matters to women and staff (17 findings, 11 moderate- or high-confidence) The third domain was sub-divided into two conceptual areas; personalised supportive care, and information and safety. We also developed two lines of argument, using high- or moderate-confidence findings: For women, initial or continued use of ANC depends on a perception that doing so will be a positive experience. This is a result of the provision of good-quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees and that include continuity of care that is authentically personalised, kind, caring, supportive, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful of women\u2019s need for privacy, and that allow staff to take the time needed to provide relevant support, information and clinical safety for the woman and the baby, as and when they need it. Women\u2019s perceptions of the value of ANC depend on their general beliefs about pregnancy as a healthy or a risky state, and on their reaction to being pregnant, as well as on local socio-cultural norms relating to the advantages or otherwise of antenatal care for healthy pregnancies, and for those with complications (An adverse event that has a concise explanation of the meaning of term.). Whether they continue to use ANC or not depends on their experience of ANC design and provision when they access it for the first time. The capacity of healthcare providers to deliver (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) the kind of high-quality, relationship-based, locally accessible ANC that is likely to facilitate access by women depends on the provision of sufficient resources and staffing as well as the time to provide flexible personalised, private appointments that are not overloaded (Deliberate prevention or diminution of the host's immune response.) with organisational tasks. Such provision also depends on organisational norms and values that overtly value kind, caring staff who make effective, culturally-appropriate links with local communities, who respect women\u2019s belief that pregnancy is usually a normal life event, but who can recognise and respond to complications (An adverse event that has a concise explanation of the meaning of term.) when they arise. Healthcare providers also require sufficient training and education to do their job well, as well as an adequate salary, so that they do not need to demand extra informal funds from women and families, to supplement their income, or to fund essential supplies. This review has identified key barriers (Persistently high systemic arterial BLOOD PRESSURE.) and facilitators to the uptake (or not) of ANC services by pregnant women, and in the provision (or not) of good-quality ANC by healthcare providers. It complements existing effectiveness reviews of models of ANC provision and adds essential insights into why a particular type of ANC provided in specific local contexts may or may not be acceptable, accessible, or valued by some pregnant women and their families/communities. Those providing and funding services should consider the three thematic domains identified by the review as a basis for service development and improvement. Such developments should include pregnant and postnatal women, community members and other relevant stakeholders.",

The studies took place in eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income countries and 12 low-income countries, in rural and urban locations. Our findings suggest that women use antenatal care if they find it is a positive experience that fits with their beliefs and values, is easy for them to access, affordable, and treats them as an individual. They want care that helps them to feel that they and their baby are safe, and that is provided by kind, caring, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful staff that have time to give them support and reassurance about the health and well-being of them and their babies. They also value tests and treatments that are offered when they need them, and information and advice that is relevant to them. Our findings also suggest that healthcare staff want to be able to offer this kind of care. They would like to work in antenatal services that are properly funded, and that give them proper support, pay, training and education. They believe this will help them to have enough time to treat each pregnant woman as an individual, and to have the knowledge, skills resources and equipment to do their job well.

For magnesium in addition to standard treat (A drug used to treat certain mental disorders.)ment with nimodipine (A pathological condition manifested by failure to perfuse or oxygenate vital organs.), the RR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00) for a poor outcome and 0.66 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.96) for clinical signs of secondary ischaemia. Calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal SAH (A person skilled in the performance of the technical or procedural aspects of a profession.). The results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine (A pathological condition manifested by failure to perfuse or oxygenate vital organs.); the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. The evidence for nimodipine (A pathological condition manifested by failure to perfuse or oxygenate vital organs.) is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treat (A drug used to treat certain mental disorders.)ment, oral nimodipine (A pathological condition manifested by failure to perfuse or oxygenate vital organs.) is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal SAH (A person skilled in the performance of the technical or procedural aspects of a profession.). Intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. Magnesium sulphate (Psychological aspects of SMOKING.) is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.",

                "This review of 16 trials, involving 3361 patients, has found that the outcome after subarachnoid haemorrhage, in terms of survival and being independent in activities of daily living, is improved by treatment with calcium channel blockers (antagonists). If the largest trial is excluded from the analysis, the results are no longer statistically significant, and therefore the evidence is not beyond all doubt. However, given the high likelihood of benefits and the modest risks associated with this treatment, the review authors conclude that calcium antagonists, in the form of oral nimodipine 60 mg every four hours, are useful in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm. Magnesium is another calcium antagonist with promising results, but larger trials with this drug are needed before we can be certain about a beneficial effect."

The meta-analysis of secondary malignant disease and treatment-related death (A part of a computer screen that contains a display different from the rest of the screen.) did not show any significant statistical differences between the treatment groups.

All studies (A pathological accumulation of air in tissues or organs.) had some methodological limitations. Based on the currently available evidence, myeloablative therapy (Blockage in the biliary tract caused by a malignant neoplasm.) seems to work in terms of event-free survival. For overall survival there is currently no evidence of effect when additional follow-up data are included. No definitive conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects and quality of life, although possible higher levels of adverse effects should be kept in mind. A definitive conclusion regarding the effect of myeloablative therapy (Blockage in the biliary tract caused by a malignant neoplasm.) in different subgroups is not possible. This systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy (Blockage in the biliary tract caused by a malignant neoplasm.); no conclusions can be made regarding the best treatment strategy. Future trials on the use of myeloablative therapy (Blockage in the biliary tract caused by a malignant neoplasm.) for high-risk neuroblastoma (A substance relating to or containing elemental carbon or carbon compounds.) should focus on identifying the most optimal induction and/or myeloablative regimen (Allowing the passage of light such that images can be seen through with clarity.). The best study design to answer these questions is a RCT. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (e.g. stage of disease and patient age) and have a long-term follow-up. Different risk groups, using the most recent definitions, should be taken into account. It should be kept in mind that recently the age cut-off for high risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months. As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate-risk disease have been included in the high-risk groups.

The authors found three studies including 739 patients. These studies provide evidence that myeloablative therapy improves event-free survival (that is, the time until a certain event, for example tumour progression, the development of a second tumour, or death from any cause occurs). For overall survival (that is, the time until a patient dies from any cause, so not only from the tumour or its treatment, but for example, also from a car accident) there is no evidence of a better outcome in patients treated with myeloablative therapy. Side effects such as renal (kidney) effects, interstitial pneumonitis (a type of lung disease) and veno-occlusive disease (a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed) were more common in patients treated with myeloablative therapy than conventional chemotherapy. It should be noted that this systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy; no conclusions regarding the best treatment strategy with regard to, for example, types of chemotherapeutic agents and the use of radiation therapy, could be made. More high quality research is needed. It should be noted that recently the age cut-off for high-risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months.

The meta-analysis (including all fibrate trials) showed evidence for a protective effect of fibrates (The visually perceived property of objects created by absorption or reflection of specific wavelengths of light.) primarily compared to placebo (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) for the primary composite outcome of non-fatal stroke (An approach of practicing medicine with the goal to improve and evaluate patient care.), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.94; participants = 16,064; studies = 12; I2 = 45%, fixed effect). Fibrates were moderately effective for preventing (Focal accumulations of EDEMA fluid in the NASAL MUCOSA accompanied by HYPERPLASIA of the associated submucosal connective tissue.) MI occurrence (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.93; participants = 13,942; studies = 10; I2 = 24%, fixed effect). Fibrates were not effective against all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; participants = 13,653; studies = 10; I2 = 23%), death from vascular causes (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; participants = 13,653; studies = 10; I2 = 11%, fixed effect), and stroke (An approach of practicing medicine with the goal to improve and evaluate patient care.) events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.16; participants = 11,719; studies = 6; I2 = 11%, fixed effect). Excluding clofibrate trials, as the use of clofibrate was discontinued in 2002 due to safety concerns, the remaining class of fibrates (The visually perceived property of objects created by absorption or reflection of specific wavelengths of light.) were no longer effective in preventing (Focal accumulations of EDEMA fluid in the NASAL MUCOSA accompanied by HYPERPLASIA of the associated submucosal connective tissue.) the primary composite outcome (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; participants = 10,320; studies = 7; I2 = 50%, random effects). However, without clofibrate data, fibrates (The visually perceived property of objects created by absorption or reflection of specific wavelengths of light.) remained effective in preventing (Focal accumulations of EDEMA fluid in the NASAL MUCOSA accompanied by HYPERPLASIA of the associated submucosal connective tissue.) MI (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; participants = 8304; studies = 6; I2 = 47%, fixed effect). There was no increase in adverse events (The tenth thoracic vertebra counting from the top down.) with fibrates (The visually perceived property of objects created by absorption or reflection of specific wavelengths of light.) compared to control. Subgroup analyses showed the benefit of fibrates (The visually perceived property of objects created by absorption or reflection of specific wavelengths of light.) on the primary composite outcome to be consistent irrespective of age, gender, and diabetes mellitus. Moderate evidence showed that the fibrate class can be effective in the secondary prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke (An approach of practicing medicine with the goal to improve and evaluate patient care.), non-fatal MI, and vascular death. However, this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion of clofibrate data, a drug (Hospital department responsible for the administration and provision of immediate medical or surgical care to the emergency patient.) that was discontinued in 2002 due to its unacceptably large adverse effects. Further trials of the use of fibrates (The visually perceived property of objects created by absorption or reflection of specific wavelengths of light.) in populations with previous stroke (An approach of practicing medicine with the goal to improve and evaluate patient care.) and also against a background treatment with statins (Adding nutrients to the diet.)

We included 13 trials in this review with a total of 16,112 participants with a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. This review includes evidence identified up to October 2014. Our analysis showed that when compared primarily to placebo, fibrates can be effective for prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal heart attack (myocardial infarction), and death due to circulatory disease. However, this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion on data from clofibrates, a drug that was discontinued in 2002 because of safety concerns. In other words, there is no good evidence to support the use of currently available fibrates in the prevention of future heart attacks, strokes, and circulatory disease death in people with existing circulatory disease. In combination with clofibrate data, quality of evidence was moderate for the composite (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and MI (non-fatal or fatal) outcomes and low for stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, non-fatal or fatal) and death from vascular or any cause during the treatment and scheduled follow-up period.

Mean blood loss decreased with the use of TA by 77 mL, overall (five studies, 1186 women) and with both vaginal and caesarean section births. This finding was based on studies with methodological limitations. The studies were too small to detect the effect of TA on maternal death or blood clots. Mild side effects, which include diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, were more common in women who received TA versus placebo or no intervention. No differences in blood loss and side effects were found when two different doses of TA were evaluated.

We looked at several outcomes, including influenza A, fever duration, cough, headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness and stimulation/insomnia.

In seven studies (Absence of air in the entire or part of a lung, such as an incompletely inflated neonate lung or a collapsed adult lung.) the women were undergoing IUI and in two studies (Absence of air in the entire or part of a lung, such as an incompletely inflated neonate lung or a collapsed adult lung.) the women were trying to conceive from sexual intercourse. Eight trials compared intentional endometrial injury with no injury/placebo procedure (carried out in a specific political unit.); of these two trials also compared intentional endometrial injury in the cycle prior to IUI with intentional endometrial injury in the IUI cycle.

Higher vs. lower degree of intentional endometrial injury When we compared hysteroscopy (Those facilities which administer health services to individuals who do not require hospitalization or institutionalization.) with endometrial injury to hysteroscopy (Those facilities which administer health services to individuals who do not require hospitalization or institutionalization.) alone, there was no evidence of a difference in ongoing pregnancy rate (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.35; one RCT, 332 participants; low quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.01; one RCT, 332 participants, low quality evidence). This study did not report the primary outcome of pain during the procedure (carried out in a specific political unit.). Timing of intentional endometrial injury When endometrial injury was performed in the cycle prior to IUI compared to the same cycle as the IUI, there was no evidence of a difference in ongoing pregnancy rate (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.16, one RCT, 176 participants; very low quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy rate (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.36; two RCTs, 276 participants; very low quality evidence). Neither of these studies (Absence of air in the entire or part of a lung, such as an incompletely inflated neonate lung or a collapsed adult lung.) reported the primary outcome of pain during the procedure (carried out in a specific political unit.).

It is uncertain whether endometrial injury improves the probability of pregnancy and live birth/ongoing pregnancy in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse. The pooled results should be interpreted with caution as we graded the quality of the evidence as either low or very low. The main reasons we downgraded the quality of the evidence were most included studies (Absence of air in the entire or part of a lung, such as an incompletely inflated neonate lung or a collapsed adult lung.) were at a high risk of bias and had an overall low level of precision.

The women in seven studies were trying to get pregnant from IUI, and from intercourse in two studies. Most women had a type of subfertility known as unexplained subfertility, which means that after having all routine tests done there is no obvious explanation for why the couple has not become pregnant so far. Eight trials compared intentional endometrial injury with no injury/placebo procedure; of these two trials also compared intentional endometrial injury in the cycle prior to IUI with intentional endometrial injury in the IUI cycle. One trial compared higher vs. lower degree of intentional endometrial injury. The evidence is current to 31 October 2015. The results from the included studies suggest a beneficial effect of endometrial injury on the chance of getting pregnant, but the studies are associated with many significant limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to say with any confidence whether endometrial injury can increase the probability of pregnancy. We are uncertain whether endometrial injury increases the probability of a live birth or a pregnancy beyond 12 weeks. The endometrial injury procedure is a common procedure and is known to cause a degree of temporary pain or discomfort. Only one included study reported on whether the women experienced pain during the procedure, and the average pain experienced was six out of 10 on a visual scale from zero to 10. Endometrial injury does not seem to have an effect on miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or multiple pregnancy. No studies reported bleeding after the procedure. The quality of the evidence was low or very low as assessed using GRADE criteria. In general, the studies included in this review were not very well designed and did not recruit a high enough number of women to provide meaningful results. This means the results must be treated cautiously, and further studies are needed to confirm the findings. There remains uncertainty about whether or not the endometrial injury procedure increases the probability of having a baby."

Only one study measured negative effects of the interventions, and reported that there were no serious events. The most common non-serious events reported were damage to the mouth and tooth staining.

                "Five studies including 149 participants were identified. These studies assessed budesonide versus placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine and Pepto-Bismol\u00ae versus placebo. The study which compared mesalazine to mesalazine plus cholestyramine and the study which compared beclometasone dipropionate to mesalazine were judged to be of low quality. The study which compared Pepto-Bismol\u00ae bismuth subsalicylate to a placebo was judged as low quality due to a very small sample size (5 participants) and limited data. The other three studies were judged to be high quality. A pooled analysis of two studies (57 participants) showed that budesonide (9 mg/day for 6 to 8 weeks) was superior to placebo for improvement of diarrhea and improvement of microscopic inflammation of the bowel. Improvement in diarrhea was noted in 88% of budesonide participants compared to 38% of placebo participants. Improvement in microscopic inflammation was reported in 78% of budesonide participants compared to 33% of placebo participants. Forty-one participants were enrolled in the study that compared mesalazine (2.4. g/day) to mesalazine plus cholestyramine (4 g/day). Improvement in diarrhea was noted in 85% of participants in the mesalazine group compared to 86% of participants in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine group. Five patients were enrolled in the trial studying Pepto-Bismol\u00ae (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks versus placebo). There were no differences in improvement of diarrhea or in improvement of microscopic inflammation of the bowel. Forty-six participants were enrolled in the trial studying beclometasone dipropionate (5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) versus mesalazine (2.4 g/day). Although participants receiving beclometasone dipropionate (84%) and mesalazine (86%) had improved diarrhea at 8 weeks, this improvement was not maintained at 12 months (26% and 20%, respectively). Side effects reported in the budesonide studies include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, abdominal pain, excessive sweating and headache. Side effects reported in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine study included nausea and skin rash. Side effects in the beclometasone dipropionate trial included nausea, sleepiness and change of mood. No side effects were reported in the Pepto-Bismol\u00ae study. Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide may be an effective therapy for the treatment of lymphocytic colitis. Low quality evidence also suggests that mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may be effective for treatment of lymphocytic colitis. No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth subsalicylate due to the very small number of participants in the study. In the future, researchers should consider further large placebo-controlled trials of budesonide to confirm the suggested benefit and safety of this therapy. Bismuth subsalicylate, which has less potential for toxicity than budesonide, also warrants further study. The effectiveness and safety of mesalazine with or without cholestyramine, and beclometasone dipropionate need to be investigated in a large placebo-controlled studies."

Intervention duration ranged from 6 months (26 weeks) to 12 months (52 weeks). Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMBG with SMUG (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.), one study was a three-armed trial comparing SMBG and SMUG (not restricted to a specific field of MEDICINE.) with usual care and one study was a three-armed trial comparing less intensive SMBG and more intensive SMBG with a control group. Seven out of 11 studies had a low risk of bias for most indicators. Meta-analysis of studies including patients with a diabetes (Clinical sign or symptom manifested as debility, or lack or loss of strength and energy.) duration of one year or more showed a statistically significant SMBG induced decrease in HbA1c at up to six months follow-up (-0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; 2324 participants, nine trials), yet an overall statistically non-significant SMBG induced decrease was seen at 12 month follow-up (-0.1; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.04; 493 participants, two trials). Qualitative analysis of the effect of SMBG on well-being and quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. Two trials reported costs of self-monitoring: One trial compared the costs of self-monitoring of blood glucose with self-monitoring of urine glucose (Agents that are capable of inducing a total or partial loss of sensation, especially tactile sensation and pain.) based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US dollars for self-monitoring in 1990. Authors concluded that total costs in the first year of self-monitoring of blood glucose, with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose (Agents that are capable of inducing a total or partial loss of sensation, especially tactile sensation and pain.) ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]). Another trial reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self-monitoring. At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention were \u00a389 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), \u00a3181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self-monitoring group and \u00a3173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self-monitoring group. Higher losses to follow-up in the more intensive self-monitoring group were responsible for the difference in costs, compared to the less intensive self-monitoring group. There were few data on the effects on other outcomes and these effects were not statistically significant. None of the studies reported data on morbidity. From this review, we conclude that when diabetes (Clinical sign or symptom manifested as debility, or lack or loss of strength and energy.) duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (A superfamily of hundreds of closely related HEMEPROTEINS found throughout the phylogenetic spectrum, from animals, plants, fungi, to bacteria.) (Clinical sign or symptom manifested as debility, or lack or loss of strength and energy.) who are not using insulin (The study of PHYSICAL PHENOMENA and PHYSICAL PROCESSES as applied to living things.) is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. Furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that SMBG affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes (Clinical sign or symptom manifested as debility, or lack or loss of strength and energy.) specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of SMBG on hypoglycaemia (The larger lobe of the left lung, situated below and behind the oblique fissure.) and diabetic complications.",

However, hypoglycaemic episodes were more often reported in the self-monitoring blood glucose groups than in the control groups (four studies). Because patients in the self-monitoring blood glucose groups can use their device to confirm both periods of asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes, this is according to expectations."

Contingency management plus standard maintenance was superior for drug misuse for outpatients with cocaine dependence (A sensation of discomfort emanating from the inferiormost (verterbrochondral or vertebral) ribs.) in one study but not in another, possibly because of differences in the behavioural intervention (Process by which organic tissue becomes hardened by the physiologic deposit of calcium salts.).

Only three studies reported outcome measures that were originally defined in the review protocol as being of particular importance in this disorder (reconviction and aggression). Nonetheless, there was some evidence that a type of treatment known as contingency management (which provides rewards for progress in treatment) could help people with antisocial personality disorder to reduce their misuse of drugs or alcohol. Further research is urgently needed to clarify which psychological treatments are effective for people with this disorder. This research is best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials. Such trials should focus on the key features of antisocial personality disorder. To be informative, they need to be carried out with samples of participants of sufficient size."

Participants were 12 to 77 years old (100 males; 62 females). One study was funded by a pharmaceutical company. The severity of the condition ranged from mild to severe. Streptococcus bacteria were found in the throats of 14% of people. We classed outcomes measured within eight weeks of the start of treatment as short-term, and those measured at least one year after the start of treatment as long-term. The antibiotic trials in guttate psoriasis patients were all short-term in duration; the antibiotic trial in chronic plaque psoriasis was 48 weeks long. Three studies included participants with guttate psoriasis, and assessed the short-term effects of antibiotics: penicillin (20 participants), or erythromycin compared to no treatment (43 participants), and rifampicin compared to placebo (20 participants). Two studies included participants with chronic plaque psoriasis. One study assessed azithromycin (antibiotic) versus vitamin C at 48 weeks (50 participants); one assessed tonsillectomy versus no intervention at eight weeks and 24 months (29 participants). These results are backed by very low-quality evidence, so we are not certain of their accuracy. Each result is based on only one study. No studies measured our main outcome of interest, the time taken for the skin to be clear or almost clear of lesions, or the risk of relapsing at least once during long-term follow-up. No side effects were seen when penicillin was compared with no treatment in people with guttate psoriasis. Side effects were not measured for the comparisons of rifampicin versus placebo, or erythromycin versus no treatment. In participants with chronic plaque psoriasis, one trial assessed azithromycin versus vitamin C, and 10 participants in the azithromycin group complained of nausea or mild stomach upset. A trial of tonsillectomy versus no treatment reported one case of minor bleeding in the tonsillectomy group. Two studies in participants with chronic plaque psoriasis measured the number of participants achieving a 75% reduction on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75). In one, 18/30 participants in the azithromycin group reached PASI 75 versus none in the vitamin C group. In the other, 3/15 in the tonsillectomy group reached PASI 75 versus none in the no treatment group. The guttate psoriasis trials did not assess this outcome. We are uncertain whether the number of participants with guttate psoriasis achieving clear or almost clear skin differs between those given penicillin and those receiving no treatment. Only one participant with chronic plaque psoriasis achieved almost clear skin in the tonsillectomy group compared to none in the no treatment group. The other three trials did not measure this outcome. Many of our main outcomes were not assessed. Those that were assessed were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are not sure of their accuracy. The studies were very small, and had a high risk of bias because participants and trial assessors were aware of treatment allocation. More studies are needed to see if antibiotic treatment of Streptococcal infection shortens the duration of acute guttate psoriasis, stopping it from turning into a long-term condition (chronic plaque psoriasis)."

                "Our systematic search identified 12 studies enrolling 933 people with MS. Research shows that vitamin D has no effect on recurrence of relapse, worsening of disability measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or new MRI gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions. Its effects on health-related quality of life and fatigue are unclear. Our confidence in these results is very low because vitamin D has been evaluated in only a few small trials that we judged as having high risk of bias. Vitamin D supplementation appears to be safe for people with MS included in our review, but available data are limited. For people with MS, vitamin D supplementation appears to have no effect on relevant clinical outcomes or new MRI lesions. Vitamin D supplementation at the doses and treatment durations used in the included trials appears to be safe, although available data are limited.

We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not included in this update. This review contains a total of 62 included studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.), with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest (characterized by fluctuating SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS; TINNITUS; episodic VERTIGO; and aural fullness.) number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Overall we judged the included studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief. Fifteen studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared oral morphine modified release (Mm/r) preparations with morphine immediate release (MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls)). Fourteen studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared Mm/r in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release products. Fifteen studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared Mm/r with other opioids. Six studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls) with other opioids. Two studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared oral Mm/r with rectal Mm/r. Three studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls) with MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls) by a different route of administration. Two studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) compared Mm/r with Mm/r at different times and two compared MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls) with MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls) given at a different time. One study was found comparing each of the following: Mm/r tablet with Mm/r suspension; Mm/r with non-opioids; MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls) with non-opioids; and oral morphine with epidural morphine. In the previous update, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale (VAS (The right to obtain or make use of or take advantage of something (as services or membership); the right to enter.)), or the equivalent in other pain scales (A measure of how far a patient can move a body part against gravity). Eighteen studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief were not attained. Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.), 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638). Morphine (Trauma to the colon.) is an effective analgesic for cancer pain. Pain relief (modest: intermittent but not disabling and requiring intermittent use of anti-inflammatory or non-narcotic medication for pain relief.) did not differ between Mm/r and MIR (Increased chance of conditions that results in falls). Modified release versions of morphine were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation. Daily doses in studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) ranged from 25 mg to 2000 mg with an average of between 100 mg and 250 mg. Dose titration (An acute hypersensitivity reaction due to exposure to a previously encountered ANTIGEN.) was undertaken with both instant release and modified release products. A small number of participants did not achieve adequate analgesia (The act, or process, of natural progression in physical and psychological maturation from a previous, lower, or embryonic stage to a later, more complex, or adult stage.) with morphine. Adverse events were common, predictable, and approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment with morphine because of intolerable adverse events (Men and women working in the provision of health services, whether as individual practitioners or employees of health institutions and programs, whether or not professionally trained, and whether or not subject to public regulation.). The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies (The CCGA application (Form PHS-398) requests documentation on the qualifications of the principal investigators and associates, pertinent budget information and justification for the support of this proposed grant.) are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations. The conclusions have not changed for this update. The effectiveness of oral morphine has stood the test (characterized by fluctuating SENSORINEURAL HEARING LOSS; TINNITUS; episodic VERTIGO; and aural fullness.) of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine is small given the importance of this medicine. Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief, but where it was reported, over 90% had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time period. The review demonstrates the wide dose range of morphine used in studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.), and that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral morphine. The review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in cross-over designs. Trial design was frequently based on titration (An acute hypersensitivity reaction due to exposure to a previously encountered ANTIGEN.) of morphine or comparator to achieve adequate analgesia (The act, or process, of natural progression in physical and psychological maturation from a previous, lower, or embryonic stage to a later, more complex, or adult stage.), then crossing participants over in cross-over design studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.). It was not clear if these trials were sufficiently powered to detect any clinical differences between formulations or comparator drugs. New studies (The functional units of the kidney, consisting of the glomerulus and the attached tubule.) added to the review for the previous update reinforced the view that it is possible to use modified release morphine to titrate to analgesic effect. There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine has much the same efficacy as other available opioids.",

                "In this updated review we set out to estimate how well morphine worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were \u2013 for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their oral morphine. We found 62 studies with 4241 participants. The studies were often small, compared many different preparations, and used different study designs. This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other. There did not seem to be much difference between them. More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine. More than 6 in 10 participants were very satisfied with the morphine treatment, or considered the result to be very good or excellent. Only about 1 person in 20 stopped taking morphine because of side effects. Morphine is associated with some unwanted effects, mainly constipation, and nausea and vomiting. At one level these are good results. On another level, the quality of studies is generally poor and we could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels \u2013 no worse than mild pain \u2013 so that people with cancer are not bothered by pain."

The age of participants included in the studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.) ranged from 16 to 88 years; and the majority of participants were women (approximately 70%). The average duration of symptoms ranged from three to 15 months, and the follow-up after the procedure (A preparation of chicle, sometimes mixed with other plastic substances, sweetened and flavored.) ranged from eight weeks to 23 months. The studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.) reported nine types of comparisons: open surgery versus steroid injections (two studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.)); percutaneous surgery versus steroid injection (five studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.)); open surgery versus steroid injection plus ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery plus steroid injection versus steroid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery versus open surgery (five studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.)); endoscopic surgery (Birth at 37 weeks and 0 days through 38 weeks and 6 days.) versus open surgery (one study); and three comparisons of types of incision for open surgery (transverse incision of the skin in the distal palmar crease, transverse incision of the skin about 2\u20133 mm distally from distal palmar crease, and longitudinal incision of the skin) (one study). Most studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.) had significant methodological flaws and were considered at high or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias. The primary comparison was open surgery versus steroid injections, because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid injection is the least invasive control treatment method as reported in the studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.) in this review and is often used as first-line treatment in clinical practice. Compared with steroid injection, there was low-quality evidence that open surgery provides benefits with respect to less triggering recurrence, although it has the disadvantage of being more pain (The triangular prismoid, elongated bony body of a tibia compressing of the anterior, posterior and external surfaces separated by the anterior, posterior and interosseous borders.)ful. Evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws and imprecision. Based on two trials (270 participants) from six up to 12 months, 50/130 (or 385 per 1000) individuals had recurrence of trigger finger (Problem associated with an unexpected amount of time required to charge the device (e.g.) in the steroid injection group compared with 8/140 (or 65 per 1000; range 35 to 127) in the open surgery group, RR 0.17 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.33), for an absolute risk difference that 29% fewer people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery (60% fewer to 3% more individuals); relative change translates to improvement of 83% in the open surgery group (67% to 91% better). At one week, 9/49 (184 per 1000) people had pain (The triangular prismoid, elongated bony body of a tibia compressing of the anterior, posterior and external surfaces separated by the anterior, posterior and interosseous borders.) on the palm of the hand (A medical specialty concerned with maintaining health and providing medical care to children from birth to adolescence.) in the steroid injection group compared with 38/56 (or 678 per 1000; ranging from 366 to 1000) in the open surgery group, RR 3.69 (95% CI 1.99 to 6.85), for an absolute risk difference that 49% more had pain (The triangular prismoid, elongated bony body of a tibia compressing of the anterior, posterior and external surfaces separated by the anterior, posterior and interosseous borders.) with open surgery (33% to 66% more); relative change translates to worsening of 269% (585% to 99% worse) (one trial, 105 participants). Because of very low quality evidence from two trials we are uncertain whether open surgery improve resolution of trigger finger (Problem associated with an unexpected amount of time required to charge the device (e.g.) in the follow-up at six to 12 months, when compared with steroid injection (131/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 80/130 in the control group; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.76); evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws, inconsistency and imprecision. Low-quality evidence from two trials and few event rates (270 participants) from six up to 12 months of follow-up, we are uncertain whether open surgery increased the risk of adverse events (elicited.) (incidence of infection (A diet typical of the Mediterranean region characterized by a pattern high in fruits and vegetables, EDIBLE GRAIN and bread, potatoes, poultry, beans, nuts, olive oil and fish while low in red meat and dairy and moderate in alcohol consumption.), tendon injury, flare, cutaneous discomfort and fat necrosis) (18/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 17/130 in the control group; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.84) and neurovascular injury (9/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 4/130 in the control group; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.7 to 6.77). Twelve participants (8 versus 4) did not complete the follow-up, and it was considered that they did not have a positive outcome in the data analysis. We are uncertain whether open surgery was more effective than steroid injection in improving hand (A medical specialty concerned with maintaining health and providing medical care to children from birth to adolescence.) function or participant satisfaction as studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.) did not report these outcomes. Low-quality evidence indicates that, compared with steroid injection, open surgical treatment (involved with maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma.) in people with trigger finger (Problem associated with an unexpected amount of time required to charge the device (e.g.), may result in a less recurrence rate from six up to 12 months following the treatment, although it increases the incidence of pain (The triangular prismoid, elongated bony body of a tibia compressing of the anterior, posterior and external surfaces separated by the anterior, posterior and interosseous borders.) during the first follow-up week. We are uncertain about the effect of open surgery with regard to the resolution rate in follow-up at six to 12 months, compared with steroid injections, due high heterogeneity and few events occurred in the trials; we are uncertain too about the risk of adverse events (elicited.) and neurovascular injury because of a few events occurred in the studies (approximately central within some larger region or structure.).

                "This Cochrane Review is current to August 2017. We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 1260 participants, totalling 1361 trigger fingers. Two studies compared open surgery versus steroid injections, five studies compared percutaneous surgery versus steroid injection, one study compared open surgery versus steroid injection plus hyaluronic acid injection, one study compared percutaneous surgery plus steroid injection versus steroid injection, five studies compared percutaneous surgery versus open surgery, one study compared endoscopic surgery versus open surgery and one study compared three types of skin incision to open surgery. The majority of participants were female (about 70%); they were aged between 16 and 88 years; and the mean follow-up of participants after the procedure was eight weeks to 23 months. Due to space constraints, the reporting of all results was limited to the main comparison \u2014 open surgery versus steroid injection \u2014 because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid injection is the least invasive control treatment method as reported in the studies in this review and is often used as first-line treatment in clinical practice. Based on two trial (270 participants), compared with the steroid injection procedure: Resolution of trigger finger (lessening of symptoms with no recurrence): \u2022 92 out of 100 people had resolution of symptoms with open surgery. \u2022 61 out of 100 people had resolution of symptoms with steroid injection. Incidence of pain, assessed as the presence or absence of pain after the procedure was performed (at one week): \u2022 49% more people had pain with open surgery (33% to 66% more). \u2022 68 out of 100 people had pain with open surgery. \u2022 19 out of 100 people had pain with steroid injection. Recurrence of the trigger finger (from six to 12 months): \u2022 29% fewer people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery (60% fewer to 3% more). \u2022 7 out of 100 people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery. \u2022 39 out of 100 people had recurrence of symptoms with steroid injection. Adverse events: Adverse events including infections, tendon injuries, cutaneous discomfort, flare or fat necrosis at the procedure site, or neovascular events were uncommon in either treatment group. No study reported hand function or participant-reported treatment success or satisfaction. Very low quality evidence from two trials means we are uncertain whether open surgery improve resolution of trigger finger in comparison with steroid injection, due the risk of bias in the design of the studies, inconsistencies between studies and the small number of participants in studies. Low-quality evidence from two trials shows that open surgery may result in fewer recurrences of trigger finger compared with steroid injection procedure, although it increases the incidence of pain during the first week after the procedure. Evidence was downgraded to 'low' due to the risk of bias in the design and the small number of participants. No studies measured functional improvement or participant satisfaction in the comparison between open surgery and steroid injection. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events or neurovascular injury between treatments, as few events occurred in the studies. Only low and very low-quality evidence was found for other comparisons so we are uncertain if percutaneous surgery has any benefits over steroid injection, or if open surgery is better than steroid plus hyaluronic acid, or if one type of surgery is better than another."

No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment for OSA (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) as an outcome. There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of OSA (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) in children; they may have short-term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies (Having to do with the examination and treatment of patients.). Montelukast (Drugs used to induce drowsiness or sleep or to reduce psychological excitement or anxiety.) has short-term beneficial treatment effects for OSA (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) in otherwise healthy, non-obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas (An organized and comprehensive program of health care that identifies and reduces a woman's reproductive risks before conception through risk assessment, health promotion, and interventions.), hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. In addition, montelukast was well tolerated in the children studied.

Long-term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti-inflammatory medications (A series of steps taken in order to conduct research.) for the treatment of OSA (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) in childhood are still not available.

The certainty of the evidence for corticosteroid nasal spray for the treatment of OSA was low for the primary outcome due to the wide range of the beneficial effect with some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. We excluded one study from the analysis due to serious concerns about the quality of the study results. The evidence for the use of montelukast tablets in the treatment of OSA was of moderate certainty for the primary outcome. There were concerns about the design and conduct of one study and some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. The evidence is current to October 2019."

The addition of low molecular weight heparins to antithrombin supplementation did result in a lower number of symptomatic thromboses. This was statistically significant. We could not detect an effect of systemic preventive treatments in comparison with no treatment, and no difference was noted in the number of participants who suffered from major or minor bleeding.

Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side-effects, and Clearance rate. In one RCT of NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP, the difference in PASI 75 was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.32; N = 51; low quality). In three other RCTs of CPP, the clearance rates were inconsistent because in one, there was no difference between the groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; N = 54), and in the other two, the clearance rates were statistically significantly in favour of oral PUVA: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; N = 93 and RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; N = 100, respectively.

The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate for CPP was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body (The glandular tissue of the breast.) comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the NB-UVB and bath PUVA groups (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.91; N = 92; low quality), while a parallel RCT favoured bath PUVA (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71; N = 36; low quality).

Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (A test to check for blood in the stool.) (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (A test to check for blood in the stool.)

One RCT in people with CPP found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB in terms of clearance rate (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.13; N = 100; low quality) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 27.87; N = 100; low quality). No studies (A procedure in which the therapist refrains from directing the client, with unconditional positive regard for the client, and communication of accurate empathy.) reported our primary outcomes for NB-UVB compared with conventional BB-UVB.

Evidence regarding NB-UVB versus bath PUVA is also inconsistent. Re-NB-UVB and re-PUVA are similarly effective for treating people with CPP or GP. In practice, NB-UVB may be more convenient to use since exogenous photosensitiser (A response generated by a stimulus.) is not required before phototherapy (A benzenesulfonamide derivative and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with vasodilatory activity.). NB-UVB is considered ineffective for PPP (The most severe pain an individual can conceive of experiencing.) in clinical practice, and a small RCT did not detect a statistically significant difference between NB-UVB and topical PUVA for clearing PPP (The most severe pain an individual can conceive of experiencing.). NB-UVB seemed to be similar to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP.

Further conclusions are not warranted from the available data. The limited number of identified trials together with methodological weaknesses (An abnormally large hepatocyte with eosinophilic or pale, glassy cytoplasm and peripherally displaced nucleus.) of many do not allow a definitive assessment of the role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback (Denotes a person with ancestral origins are in any of the countries of Africa.) therapy in the management of people with faecal incontinence (Autosomal recessive disorder characterized by HYALINE deposition in the skin, bone, gastrointestinal tract, muscles and glands; multiple subcutaneous skin nodules; GINGIVAL HYPERTROPHY; and joint CONTRACTURES.)

By 12 weeks, investigators reported no difference between aripiprazole and lithium (SAS, BAS, AIMS), except in terms of participant-reported akathisia (RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.43; one study; N = 313). Aripiprazole (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) is an effective treatment for mania (inferior to the PELVIC DIAPHRAGM.) in a population that includes adults, children and adolescents, although its use leads to gastrointestinal disturbances and movement disorders (Any agent that dissolves mucus, making it less thick and sticky.). Comparative trials with medicines other than haloperidol (Of or relating to the activity or business by which a person earns income.) and lithium are few, so the precise place of aripiprazole in therapy remains unclear.",

                "Ten studies are included (3340 participants). Most studies compared aripiprazole versus placebo, but some researchers compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (two studies) and versus lithium (one study). Two studies examined the effect of adding aripiprazole to another treatment (valproate or lithium) and compared this combination versus placebo combined with these other treatments. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the ten studies as unclear. The main measure of effect was the mean change on the Young Mania Rating Scale from the start to the end of the trial; this tool is used by clinicians to assess the severity of mania. After three weeks of treatment, aripiprazole was better than placebo at reducing the severity of mania when used on its own or when added to other mood stabilisers. The effect was modest. However, aripiprazole caused more inner restlessness (akathisia), nausea, and constipation than placebo. Aripiprazole was similarly effective in reducing the symptoms of mania when compared with other drug treatments (haloperidol and lithium). Aripiprazole caused fewer movement disorders and less raised prolactin (a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland) than haloperidol. People taking aripiprazole were more likely to remain on treatment than those taking haloperidol but were no more or less likely than those taking placebo or lithium. The main reason for the difference in dropouts between aripiprazole and haloperidol groups was the adverse effects associated with haloperidol. In summary, aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania when compared with placebo. This finding is based on studies that included mixed populations (i.e. children, adolescents and adults). For the adult population, studies have directly compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol, lithium and placebo, but evidence obtained for treatment of the child and adolescent population is available only from placebo-controlled studies. Given the lack of evidence obtained by comparing aripiprazole versus other drugs, its exact place in therapy is unclear. Further studies focused on particular populations are needed to determine whether this treatment is equally effective in different age groups."

Particpants receiving the combined oxycodone and naloxone reported improvement in RLS symptoms, Quality of life, and sleep quality; 42% of the drug group were symptom-free. Discussion The study was well designed overall, but was at a high risk of bias due to the high percentage of participants who withdrew from treatment (attrition bias). Eighty-four percent of the drug group developed adverse events, which were mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, headache, fatigue, and sleepiness (somnolence); 9.8% left the study because of the adverse events. Conclusion The use of opioids for the treatment of RLS in patients resistant to conventional treatment is supported by low-quality evidence.

They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them. Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non-restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non-restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non-restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings."

            "input": "A total of 28 studies (involving 788 children and adults) were included in the review; 18 studies involving 296 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta-analysis. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) technique was performed using a mask, in three of the studies a mouthpiece was used with nose clips (Occurring first in time or sequence; original; of greatest rank or importance or value.) and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask or mouthpiece was used. These studies compared PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) to ACBT, autogenic drainage (used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, and of pain associated with DIABETIC NEUROPATHIES.) (AD (A primary malignant neoplasm of epithelial liver cells.)), oral oscillating PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) devices, high-frequency chest wall oscillation (The capacity to bring about a desired effect.) (HFCWO) and BiPaP (A repair that unites structures) and exercise. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants). Single interventions or series of treatments (The biting surfaces of the premolar and molar teeth.) that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence). However, long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence). A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) compared to other techniques when used with a mask for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderate- to high-quality evidence). In one of the included studies which used PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) with a mouthpiece, it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, low-quality evidence). Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.). The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high-quality evidence; only very low- to moderate-quality evidence was available for other outcomes. There was limited evidence reported on adverse events; these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events. In a study where infants performing either PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) or PDPV experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, low-quality evidence). In PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) versus oscillating PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.), adverse events were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness (The administration of a drug to a patient.), which improved after further instructions on device use was provided) (22 participants, low-quality evidence). In PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) versus HFCWO, from one long-term high-quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events; however, those in the PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) group had fewer adverse events related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (high-certainty evidence). Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures. The evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and devices described may have a place in the clinical treatment (Cannot distinguish between two or more possible values in the current context.) of people with CF. Following meta-analyses of the effects of PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was high-quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations (Medical practitioners qualified to practice surgery.) when PEP (inserted under the skin for drug delivery into the body.) using a mask was compared with HFCWO. It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms (To surround an object with a firm chemical substance such as wax or resin, in order to perform cutting of thin sections for microscopic examination.) and lung function. This also applies as conditions (A variant of ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS COLI caused by mutation in the APC gene (GENES, APC) on CHROMOSOME 5.) vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations (Medical practitioners qualified to practice surgery.).",

                "The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head-down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one-year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long-term outcomes. Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited."

All studies included patients with active Crohn\u2019s disease. Most patients were adults over 18 years of age, except for six patients aged 16 or 17 years old. All studies were funded by the drug manufacturer. In a combined analysis of the four studies, patients with active Crohn\u2019s disease who received certolizumab pegol at a dose ranging from 100 mg to 400 mg every 2 to 4 weeks, responded to the treatment and achieved remission at 8 weeks more often than patients taking placebo. No remarkable difference in the rate of serious side effects was observed between certolizumab pegol and placebo. Serious side effects included worsening Crohn's disease, infections, and malignancy (i.e. cancer). Moderate certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol is beneficial in terms of achieving remission in people with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Because of a low number of serious side effects, the certainty of evidence about harms of certolizumab pegol was moderate. Moderate certainty evidence suggests that certolizumab pegol is effective for induction of clinical remission and clinical response in people with active Crohn's disease. It is uncertain whether the risk of serious side effects differs between certolizumab pegol and placebo.

We therefore consider that there is currently not enough information to determine whether physical exercise is effective in the management of CVI. Quality of the evidence We judged the overall quality of evidence as very low: the two included studies were small (54 participants in total) and were at high risk of bias based on their methods of blinding or randomisation."

Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (An element of the rare earth family of metals.) (saline or arthrocentesis), ten trials included comparisons of intra-articular (IA) corticosteroids, six trials included comparisons of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (That which constitutes a standard from which a judgment can be established, a reference point against which other things can be evaluated, or a basis for comparison.) (NSAIDs (The first highly specific serotonin uptake inhibitor.)), three trials included comparisons of physical therapy, two trials included comparisons of exercise, two trials included comparisons of arthroscopy (A splitting open of an anatomical structure, zone, or organ with the exposure or discharge of its content.), two trials included comparisons of conventional treatment (A primary, chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations.), and fifteen trials included comparisons of other hyaluronans/hylan. The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements (MCV equals HEMATOCRIT divided by ERYTHROCYTE COUNT.) against 'placebo (An element of the rare earth family of metals.)' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention (Degree of intensity or force in regard to a physical activity.). In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different product (The period following a surgical operation.)s on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs (The first highly specific serotonin uptake inhibitor.) and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids (The lobe of the right lung, situated above the horizontal fissure, which includes the apex.). In general, few adverse events (One of approximately 20-30 lymph nodes in chain formation that traverse the concavity of the underarm to the clavicle.) were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses. Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation (Return to the normal structure and/or function, e.g.) is an effective treatment for OA (The flow of lymph from an area of tissue into a particular lymph node.) of the knee (Increase in BODY WEIGHT over existing weight.) with beneficial effects: on pain, function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different product (The period following a surgical operation.)s, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements (MCV equals HEMATOCRIT divided by ERYTHROCYTE COUNT.) and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different product (The period following a surgical operation.)s. The clinical effect for some product (The period following a surgical operation.)s, against placebo (An element of the rare earth family of metals.), on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product (The period following a surgical operation.) class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications. Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA (A double-fold of dura mater that lies within the medial longitudinal fissure, and which separates the two cerebral hemispheres.) class and particularly positive for some product (The period following a surgical operation.)s with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection (An explanation of the cause of some phenomenon or action.). In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA (A double-fold of dura mater that lies within the medial longitudinal fissure, and which separates the two cerebral hemispheres.) class of product (The period following a surgical operation.)s; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected. In some analyses viscosupplements (MCV equals HEMATOCRIT divided by ERYTHROCYTE COUNT.) were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention (Degree of intensity or force in regard to a physical activity.), with more local reactions (People in general considered as a whole.) but fewer systemic adverse events (inserted through a small incision near the navel to examine the abdominal and pelvic organs in the PERITONEAL CAVITY.) (One of approximately 20-30 lymph nodes in chain formation that traverse the concavity of the underarm to the clavicle.). In other analyses HA (A double-fold of dura mater that lies within the medial longitudinal fissure, and which separates the two cerebral hemispheres.) product (The period following a surgical operation.)s had more prolonged effects than IA corticosteroids (The lobe of the right lung, situated above the horizontal fissure, which includes the apex.).

Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.) with placebo (A system that uses a sensor under the skin to monitor glucose levels at regular intervals, providing real-time, or near real-time, glucose information.) given in addition to conventional uterotonics (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.). Adjunctive use (A group of four powerful muscles in the front of the thigh.) of misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.) (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.) did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (Affording unobstructed entrance and exit; affording free passage or access; accessible to all.) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.41). Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.) versus oxytocin (A general term for various neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid tissue.) infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.), and the other did not. Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.) were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75). Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting (The amount of three dimensional space occupied by an object or the capacity of a space or container.) and shivering. Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid (A natural tocopherol and one of the most potent antioxidant tocopherols.), respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes. One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes. We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.) and/or haemostatics. Clinical trials included in the current review were not adequately powered to assess impact on the primary outcome measures. Compared with misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.), oxytocin (A general term for various neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid tissue.) infusion is more effective and causes fewer side effects when used as first-line therapy (An indication that the patient provides information about their vital signs, status, or subjective feelings.) for the treatment of primary PPH. When used after prophylactic uterotonics (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.), misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.) and oxytocin (A general term for various neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid tissue.) infusion worked similarly. The review suggests that among women who received oxytocin (A general term for various neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid tissue.) for the treatment of primary PPH, adjunctive use of misoprostol (experimentally being used as a therapy for DEPRESSION.) confers no added benefit. The role of tranexamic acid (A natural tocopherol and one of the most potent antioxidant tocopherols.) and compression methods requires further evaluation. Furthermore, future studies should focus on the best way to treat women who fail to respond to uterotonic therapy (This gene may play a role in transcriptional repression.).",

Seven of these trials looked at a drug called misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin and so works by increasing muscle contractions. Overall, the trials suggest that misoprostol does not work as well as oxytocin infusion, and it has more side effects. However, oxytocin needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and so in settings where refrigeration and infusions are not readily available, misoprostol can be used. Other clinical trials looked into using other types of drugs or squeezing the main artery that supplies blood to the woman. The number of women included in these studies was too small for any useful conclusions regarding their effectiveness and safety."

Investigation of heterogeneity The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment (Allowing the passage of light such that images can be seen through with clarity.), participant sampling (Having to do with how the mind works and how thoughts and feelings affect behavior.), index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding). We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies (Mechanism by which the functional and/or presentational category of an item may be conveyed to a user.) available to be included. The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of dementia (the original version, published in 1974.) (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. These tests, like other biomarker tests which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity (A person 65 through 79 years of age.) than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment (Describes a disease of unknown cause.), as opposed to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies (Mechanism by which the functional and/or presentational category of an item may be conveyed to a user.) awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid.

Future studies (Mechanism by which the functional and/or presentational category of an item may be conveyed to a user.) with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies (Mechanism by which the functional and/or presentational category of an item may be conveyed to a user.) we have identified.",

The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 48%, the estimated sensitivity was 81%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 48% and the negative predictive value was 81%. Based on these results, on average 48 out of 100 people with MCI and with a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 52 would not; on average, 81 out of 100 people with MCI with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 19 would. We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic test, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. The data suggested that a negative CSF test, in people with MCI, almost indicates the absence of Alzheimer's disease as the cause of their clinical symptoms. However, a positive CSF test does not confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology (cause) of their clinical symptoms. There were methodological problems in the included studies that did not allow for a clear answer to the review question. The main limitations of the review were poor reporting in the included studies, lack of a widely accepted threshold of the CSF diagnostic tests in people with MCI, variability in length of follow-up, and the marked variation in CSF tests\u2019 accuracy between the included studies."

All included participants were male and were undergoing radical robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP). The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III. We found evidence showing no clinically meaningful differences in postoperative pain (A synthetic phenethylamine bicyclic derivative with antidepressant activity.) between the two types of anaesthetics (mean difference (MD) in visual analogue scale (An unpleasant emotional state experienced upon having an inadequacy, guilt, or socially unacceptable act or trait witnessed by or revealed to others.)

Low-quality evidence suggests that propofol reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.)) over the short term (one to six hours after surgery) after RALRP compared with inhalational anaesthesia (sevoflurane (Actions performed to measure temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure), desflurane (The transfer of a neoplasm from one organ or part of the body to another remote from the primary site.)) (MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.59 to -0.81; P = 0.0002). We found low-quality evidence suggesting that propofol may prevent an increase in intraocular (Treatment of disease by exposure to light, especially by variously concentrated light rays or specific wavelengths.) pressure (IOP) after pneumoperitoneum (Any hindrance to the passage of air into and out of the nose.) and steep Trendelenburg positioning compared with sevoflurane (Actions performed to measure temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure) (MD -3.90, 95% CI -6.34 to -1.46; P = 0.002) with increased IOP from baseline to 30 minutes in steep Trendelenburg. However, it is unclear whether this surrogate outcome translates directly to clinical avoidance of ocular (Treatment of disease by exposure to light, especially by variously concentrated light rays or specific wavelengths.) complications during surgery. No studies addressed the secondary outcomes of adverse effects, all-cause mortality, respiratory or circulatory complications, cognitive dysfunction (A family of phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze cyclic AMP to form AMP.), length of stay or costs. Overall the quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre trials providing unclear descriptions of methods. It is unclear which anaesthetic technique (The administration of live or attenuated influenza virus for the prophylaxis of influenza.) is superior - TIVA or inhalational - for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) in urology, gynaecology and gastroenterology, as existing evidence is scarce, is of low quality and has been generated from exclusively male patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy (A drug used on the skin to treat several skin conditions.).

We looked for differences in pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and changes in pressure inside the eyes between patients receiving anaesthetic via the veins or by inhalation. Study funding sources Studies were funded by the institution, or the funding sources were not stated. Key results Postoperative pain was no different between the two types of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia delivered through the veins reduced PONV at one to six hours after prostate surgery compared with anaesthesia provided via inhalation. One study showed that anaesthesia delivered through the veins prevented an increase in pressure inside the eyes during surgery compared with inhalational anaesthesia. We cannot conclude whether this means that anaesthesia provided via the veins reduces ocular complications, as no patients in this small study developed these complications. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was considered low, as included studies were small and provided an unclear description of methods.

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach to rate the overall quality of the evidence. Data from observational studies (Research aimed at assessing the quality and effectiveness of health care as measured by the attainment of a specified end result or outcome.) started at low quality. We further downgraded the evidence because of imprecision in low birth weight and inconsistency in foetal death (The administration of local anesthetic drugs into the transversus abdominal plane as an adjunct treatment for post operative pain following abdominal surgery.). Lower quality evidence resulted in lower confidence in the estimate of effect for those outcomes.

The finding of a possible protective effect of mild to moderate topical corticosteroids (Decisions, usually developed by government policymakers, for determining present and future objectives pertaining to the health care system.) on foetal death (The administration of local anesthetic drugs into the transversus abdominal plane as an adjunct treatment for post operative pain following abdominal surgery.) could also be examined.",

                "We updated the review that was previously published in 2009. We examined the research published up to July 2015 and found seven new studies. All in all, this updated review included a total of 14 observational studies that assessed 1,601,515 pregnancies. Observational studies are generally regarded as less rigorous than randomised controlled clinical trials. The funding source was from academic or governmental institutions in 10 studies and was not reported in 4 studies. We found no associations between mothers' use of topical steroids of any potency and type of delivery, birth defects, premature births, or low Apgar score. There is some evidence indicating a relation between low birth weight and maternal use of potent or very potent topical steroids, especially when high doses are used in pregnancy, and this may warrant more research. On the other hand, maternal use of mild or moderate topical corticosteroids is not related to low birth weight. We even found that mild or moderately potent topical steroids protect against death of the baby, but this was not seen when the mothers used potent or very potent topical steroids. This finding needs further examination. The overall quality of evidence is low because all available studies were observational. The high quality study design of the randomised controlled trial that allocates participants to receive either topical corticosteroids or no treatment is not generally feasible in pregnant women due to ethical concerns about possible exposure of the foetus to an experimental treatment. Where we further downgraded the quality of the evidence to 'very low', it was because we had detected variation in the results from the studies that we found, which means that we have low confidence in our estimates of the effects for our outcomes."

One trial was included in the previous version of the review, and we identified three additional trials through the updated searches in July 2014. One of the three smaller trials was a pilot study of the largest study: the Steroids (involved in ELECTRON TRANSPORT in mitochondrial preparations.) for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT). All trials compared the treatment of bacterial keratitis with topical corticosteroid (The immediate defensive reaction (by vertebrate tissue) to infection or injury caused by chemical or physical agents.)

The pilot study of the SCUT reported that time to re-epithelialization in the steroid (Cessation of heart beat or MYOCARDIAL CONTRACTION.) group was 53% slower than the placebo group after adjusting for baseline (Joined in some kind of relationship.) epithelial defect size (hazard ratio (HR) 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.94). However, the SCUT did not find any important difference in time to re-epithelialization (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.11). For adverse events, none of the three small trials found any important difference between the two treatment groups.

Further, three of the four trials were underpowered to detect treatment effect differences between groups and inconsistency in outcome measurements precluded meta-analyses for most outcomes relevant to this review.

Current evidence does not support a strong effect of corticosteroid (The immediate defensive reaction (by vertebrate tissue) to infection or injury caused by chemical or physical agents.)

Only one study (120 families, 143 children), based in London, England, matched all inclusion criteria and was included in the review. Evidence is current to April 2014. Currently very limited evidence is available on the effects of centre-based day care on the cognitive and psychosocial development of children, parental employment or household income, or on long-term outcomes for children. Only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) was included in this review. In addition, a large proportion of families in the non-intervention group secured day care services for themselves. The quality of the evidence included in this review is very low, so the results must be interpreted with caution. Although RCTs do not allow conclusive judgements as regards the role of centre-based day care in the development of children and the economic situation of parents, this does not imply that these services are not important in high-income countries. The need for effectiveness studies of centre-based day care without co-interventions is significant.

Based on an illustrative risk of 100 re-operations (The state of the REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM when functioning optimally without evidence of disease, disorders, or deficiencies.) for adverse outcomes within one year of plate fixation (Abnormally low BLOOD PRESSURE that can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain and other vital organs.) in 1000 people with these fractures, 63 fewer (95% CI 88 fewer to 12 more) people per 1000 would have re-operations (The state of the REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM when functioning optimally without evidence of disease, disorders, or deficiencies.) after nailing. Similarly pooled data (173 participants, 3 trials) for the symptomatic nonunion or malunion, wound complications (Surgical removal of ribs, allowing the chest wall to move inward and collapse a diseased lung.) and fracture union favoured nailing but the 95% confidence intervals crossed the line of no effect and thus included the possibility of a better outcome after plating (Large in quantity, range, or spatial extent.). Evidence from one trial (85 participants) showed no clinically important difference in pain (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.) between the two groups. Overall, there is either no or insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the use of surgery or the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults. The available evidence, which is of very low quality, found no clinically important differences in function or pain (Devices, not affixed to the body, designed to help persons having musculoskeletal or neuromuscular disabilities to perform activities involving movement.), and did not confirm a difference in the need for re-operation or risk of complications (Surgical removal of ribs, allowing the chest wall to move inward and collapse a diseased lung.) between nailing and plating (Large in quantity, range, or spatial extent.). The addition of evidence from two ongoing trials of nailing versus plating (Large in quantity, range, or spatial extent.) should inform this question in future updates. Further randomised trials are warranted on other issues, but should be preceded by research to identify priority questions.",

                "We searched medical databases and trials registries in December 2014. We wanted to include studies in which receiving one surgical treatment or another surgical treatment was decided by chance. This research method, termed a randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to ensure that any measured improvement is caused by the treatment itself and no other factors. We found three RCTs involving 213 adults (with results available from 173) that compared nailing versus plating for treating distal tibial fractures. Overall the studies included around twice as many males as females and the average age of the study participants was just over 40 years. We found no trials comparing surgery with non-surgical treatment. We found no clear differences between the nailing and plating groups in terms of patient-reported functional outcomes, re-operations for adverse outcomes, troublesome non-healing of the bone or deformity, pain, wound problems such as infection, or the numbers of individuals with healed fractures. Only three trials were identified and the sample sizes were small, so the results are imprecise. Moreover, the results of one trial were very likely to be biased due to flawed methodology. We therefore judged the overall quality of evidence to be very low, which means that we are very unsure of these results. Overall, the evidence is of very low quality and is insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the best method of surgery, including nailing versus plating, for treating breaks of the lower end of the shin bone in adults. Future updates of this review are likely to include evidence from currently ongoing research comparing nailing versus plating. Although other RCTs are needed to address key clinical questions on surgical methods for treating these fractures, these studies should be preceded by research to determine which questions should be prioritised."

                "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a set of symptoms experienced when one reduces or stops alcohol consumption after prolonged periods of alcohol intake. Some studies show that AWS coincides with low levels of magnesium in the blood. Since magnesium may play a role in dampening the excitability of the central nervous system, some researchers believe that low levels of magnesium may make the central nervous system 'hyper-excitable' and may cause AWS symptoms, which include sleeplessness, tremors, anxiety, headache, excessive sweating and reduced appetite. Many AWS treatment protocols therefore recommend magnesium supplementation. The goal of our review was to determine whether magnesium supplementation prevents or treats AWS in adults. Our review of four trials covering 317 participants determined that there is not enough evidence about the benefits or harms of using magnesium supplements to prevent or treat AWS in adults."

Five (diagnosis based on symptoms described to a doctor) to 11 (diagnosis confirmed by x-ray) more people per 100 were cured faster with antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan could better predict who would benefit from antibiotics, but routine use would cause health problems related to radiation exposure. Ten more people per 100 were relieved faster of thick, yellow discharge from the nose with antibiotics compared to a dummy drug or no treatment. Thirteen more people per 100 experienced side effects (mostly concerning stomach or intestines) with antibiotics compared to a dummy drug or no treatment. Compared with people who initially started antibiotics, five more people per 100 in the dummy drug or no treatment group had to start antibiotics because their condition worsened. Serious complications (e.g. brain abscess) were rare. We found that antibiotics are not a first-choice treatment for adults with short-duration sinus infection. We found no evidence relating to adults with severe sinusitis or with reduced immunity, or to children. We found high-quality evidence when the diagnosis was based on symptoms described to a doctor. We downgraded evidence quality to moderate when diagnosis was confirmed by x-ray or CT scan because the number of participants was small, which makes the estimates less reliable."

When the effect of Tai Chi used in addition to another intervention (i.e. breathing exercise or exercise) was examined, we did not find that Tai Chi offered additional benefit in terms of shortness of breath or functional and psychosocial well-being. Currently, only one study has investigated the beneficial effects of Tai Chi on muscle strength and balance; investigators provided insufficient information to allow comment on the data in this review. Future studies addressing these topics are warranted."

            "input": "We included 72 trials that involved 2470 participants. This review includes 35 new studies in addition to the studies included in the previous version of this review. Study sample sizes were generally small and intervention (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.)s varied in terms of both the goals of treatment and the virtual reality devices used. The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system. Control groups usually received no intervention (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) or therapy based on a standard-care approach. Primary outcome: results were not statistically significant for upper limb function (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.07, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.05 to 0.20, 22 studies, 1038 participants, low-quality evidence) when comparing virtual reality to conventional therapy (The determination of the amount of free and bound thyroxine present in a sample.). However, when virtual reality was used in addition to usual care (providing a higher dose of therapy for those in the intervention (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) group) there was a statistically significant difference between groups (SMD 0.49, 0.21 to 0.77, 10 studies, 210 participants, low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes: when compared to conventional therapy (The determination of the amount of free and bound thyroxine present in a sample.) approaches there were no statistically significant effects for gait speed (Marked by a reasonable or logical relation of parts and holding together as a harmonious or credible whole.) or balance. Results were statistically significant for the activities of daily living (ADL) outcome (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.43, 10 studies, 466 participants, moderate-quality evidence); however, we were unable to pool results for cognitive function, participation restriction, or quality of life. Twenty-three studies reported that they monitored for adverse events (not displayed totally in its corresponding pixels (voxels).); across these studies there were few adverse events (not displayed totally in its corresponding pixels (voxels).) and those reported were relatively mild. We found evidence that the use of virtual reality and interactive video gaming was not more beneficial than conventional therapy (The determination of the amount of free and bound thyroxine present in a sample.) approaches in improving upper limb function. Virtual reality may be beneficial in improving upper limb function and activities of daily living function when used as an adjunct to usual care (to increase overall therapy time). There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed (Marked by a reasonable or logical relation of parts and holding together as a harmonious or credible whole.), balance, participation, or quality of life. This review found that time since onset of stroke (Not stated explicitly or in detail.), severity of impairment, and the type of device (commercial or customised) were not strong influencers of outcome. There was a trend suggesting that higher dose (more than 15 hours of total intervention (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.)) was preferable as were customised virtual reality programs; however, these findings were not statistically significant.",

                "We identified 72 studies involving 2470 people after stroke. A wide range of virtual reality programs were used, with most aimed to improve either arm function or walking ability. The evidence is current to April 2017. Twenty-two trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in an improved ability to use one's arm and found that the use of virtual reality did not result in better function (low-quality evidence). When virtual reality was used in addition to usual care or rehabilitation to increase the amount of time the person spent in therapy there were improvements in the functioning of the arm (low-quality evidence). Six trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved walking speed. There was no evidence that virtual reality was more effective in this case (low-quality evidence). Ten trials found that there was some evidence that virtual reality resulted in a slightly better ability to manage everyday activities such as showering and dressing (moderate-quality evidence). However, these positive effects were found soon after the end of the treatment and it is not clear whether the effects are long lasting. Results should be interpreted with caution as, while there are a large number of studies, the studies are generally small and not of high quality. A small number of people using virtual reality reported pain, headaches, or dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported. The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to small numbers of study participants, inconsistent results across studies, and poor reporting of study details."

There is insufficient evidence to be clear whether addition or substitution of fluoroquinolones (Any platelet aggregation process that decreases the rate, frequency or extent of platelet aggregation.) for ethambutol (Combination of HEALTH KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, PRACTICE which underlie actions taken by individuals regarding their health.) or isoniazid in the first-line regimen reduces death or relapse, or increases culture conversion at eight weeks. Much larger trials with fluoroquinolones (Any platelet aggregation process that decreases the rate, frequency or extent of platelet aggregation.) in short course regimens of four months are currently in progress.",

                "We examined the research published up to 6 March 2013 and we identified five randomised controlled trials (1330 people) that met the inclusion criteria. The trials were performed in low- and middle-income countries located in geographically diverse areas but there was a lack of studies conducted in Asia. We found no studies that examined the effect of including fluoroquinolones in a standard six month TB treatment regimen on treatment failure. We do not know whether adding fluoroquinolones or substituting fluoroquinolones for ethambutol in a standard six month TB treatment regimen reduces treatment failure, relapse, death, or adverse events. Substituting fluoroquinolones for isoniazid in a standard six month TB treatment regimen may have little or no difference upon death and adverse events. Currently, there are nine randomised controlled trials ongoing. HIV-positive participants were relatively well-represented in the included trials but none of the included trials stratified outcomes by HIV status. Also, the primary outcomes of all the included trials were reached before initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Evidence is generally lacking on the safety and efficacy of fluoroquinolone additions or substitutions in children (< 18 years) and in pregnant and lactating women."
