Asthma education aimed at children and their carers who present to the emergency department for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future emergency department presentation and hospital admission. There remains uncertainty as to the long-term effect of education on other markers of asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) morbidity such as quality of life, symptoms and lung function.

Perioperative intravenous ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) reduced pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at rest at 24 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (A pain scale marked off like a ruler from 0 to 10 on which the patient marks the current level of pain experienced.)

Pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) during movement was reduced at 24 hours (6/100 mm, 14% lower from 42/100 mm, moderate-quality evidence; 29 studies, 1806 participants), and 48 hours (6/100 mm, 16% lower from 37 mm, low-quality evidence; 23 studies, 1353 participants). Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at rest or on movement, operation (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) to study size and pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity. No analysis by dose was possible. There was no difference when nitrous oxide (Nitrogen oxide (N2O).) was used. We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small-study effects likely but testing not possible. Ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request by 54 minutes (95% CI 37 to 71 minutes), from a mean of 39 minutes with placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (moderate-quality evidence; 31 studies, 1678 participants). Ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia (An increased sensation of pain or discomfort produced by mimimally noxious stimuli due to damage to soft tissue containing NOCICEPTORS or injury to a peripheral nerve.) by 7 cm\u00b2 (95% CI \u221211.9 to \u22122.2), compared with placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.)

CNS adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.) occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.). Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment experienced an adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4; high-quality evidence; 105 studies, 6538 participants). Ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) reduced postoperative nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) and vomiting (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) from 27% with placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) to 23% with ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.)

Perioperative intravenous ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity.

CNS adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.) were little different with ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) or control. Perioperative intravenous ketamine (A cyclohexanone derivative used for induction of anesthesia.) probably reduces postoperative nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) and vomiting (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) by a small extent, of arguable clinical relevance.",

                "In July 2018 we searched for randomised clinical trials where ketamine was injected before, during, or after operation in adults having an operation under general anaesthesia. Important outcomes were opioid use and pain at 24 and 48 hours after the operation, time to first request for a painkiller, and ketamine-related side effects. We found 130 eligible studies with 8341 participants. Compared to people given control treatment, those given intravenous ketamine used less opioid painkiller (by about 1 part in 10), and had less pain (by about 2 parts in 10; moderate- or high-quality evidence). Ketamine may be more effective in operations that are likely to cause more intense pain. People given ketamine requested painkillers 54 minutes later than those who did not receive ketamine (moderate-quality evidence). Ketamine reduced the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small amount (high-quality evidence). Ketamine produced no increased risk of central nervous system side effects (hallucination, nightmares or double vision) (high-quality evidence). Future research should assess ketamine's effect after operations that are accompanied by intense pain such as thoracotomy, back surgery, or amputations. Additionally, assessing ketamine's effects among particular patient groups, for example, the elderly or individuals with a history of substance abuse would be of interest. We rated the quality of the evidence from studies using four levels: very low, low, moderate, or high. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the results. High-quality evidence means that we are very confident in the results. We found the quality of evidence for most outcomes to be moderate. Many of the studies were small, which was the main reason for downgrading the evidence from high to moderate. We tested the results by operation type, timing of ketamine injection, and by looking at larger studies, and those with more pain were consistent, and provided confidence in the results. There was sufficient evidence to allow conclusions about ketamine's effect on pain, painkiller consumption and side effects after operation."

A sensitivity analysis (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) conducted to determine the effect of multiple follow-up time-points on the heterogeneity amongst the studies showed that the effect size remained non-significant at 24 weeks (risk ratio 1.61; 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 3.54; 3 trials), with similar heterogeneity (I2 = 57%).

Three recent trials (of levonorgestrel intrauterine system or CuT380A) showed use was greater at six months for an IUD inserted right away compared to one inserted later. Another trial assigned women to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T; more women with the Nova T stopped use due to pregnancy. A subanalysis showed more IUDs came out when inserted right after abortion or miscarriage rather than later. Seven trials looked at inserting the IUD right away. From two large trials, the TCu 220C was better than the Lippes Loop and the Copper 7 for preventing pregnancy and staying in. The IUD was more likely to come out on its own when inserted after a mid-pregnancy abortion than after an earlier one. In other work, when the Lippes Loop had copper arms added, fewer women got pregnant and the IUD stayed in more often. Moderate level evidence shows that inserting an IUD right after an abortion or miscarriage is safe and practical.

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and set no limits regarding language, or date, of publication, or trial size. Two review authors identified studies and extracted data independently. We identified 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants. Eleven trials compared 16 preventative (prophylactic) antibiotic treatments, and one compared antibiotic prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Generally, MRSA status of the participants prior to surgery was not known. Four studies reported deaths (14/1401 participants): approximately 1% of participants died from any cause after surgery, but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Four trials reported on serious antibiotic-related adverse events - there were none in 561 participants. None of the trials reported quality of life, length of hospital stay or use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221 SSIs due to any bacterium developed in 4032 people (6%), and 46 MRSA SSIs developed in 4704 people (1%). There were no significant differences in development of SSIs between the 15 comparisons of one antibiotic treatment against another. When antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis, a significantly lower proportion of people developed SSIs after receiving co-amoxiclav (74% reduction in all SSIs, and 95% reduction in MRSA SSIs). Two trials reported that 19 participants developed MRSA infection in wounds (SSIs), chest, or bloodstream, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed them between the two comparisons. Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in people without cancer undergoing surgery for feeding tube insertion into the stomach using endoscopy, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence that either a combination of prophylactic antibiotics, or increased duration of antibiotic treatment, benefits people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections.

Non-absorbable staples had an increased risk of skin separation and, therefore, reclosure. Skin separation was defined differently across trials and removal of staples varied from about day three to day seven postoperatively. There is not enough evidence from the included studies to say which method of closing the caesarean skin incision is superior. Too few trials compared different kinds of sutures.

            "input": "We screened 1796 records and identified five eligible trials in total i.e. one trial could be added on the previous review. These trials included only adults (16 to 65 years of age). We included all five trials with 3427 people in the meta-analyses: the HD9 (encoded by the human HDAC9 gene.) and HD14 trials were co-ordinated in Germany, the HD2000 and GSM-HD trials were performed in Italy and the EORTC 20012 was conducted in Belgium. The overall risk of performance and detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) bias was low for overall survival (OS), but was high for other outcomes, as therapy blinding was not feasible. The remaining 'Risk of bias' domains were low and unclear. All trials reported results for OS and progression-free survival (PFS). In contrast to the our first published review (2011) the addition of results from the EORTC 20012 BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) escalated increases OS (3142 participants; HR 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.97; high-quality evidence). This means that only 90 (70 to 117) patients will die after five years in the BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) escalated arm compared to 120 in the ABVD (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.) arm. This survival advantage is also reflected in an increased PFS with BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) escalated (3142 participants; HR 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.64); moderate-quality evidence), meaning that after five years only 144 (121 to 168) patients will experience a progress, relapse or death in the BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) escalated arm compared to 250 in the ABVD (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.) arm. There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related (The development of a malignant neoplasm in response to medical or surgical treatment, induced by the treatment itself.) mortality (2700 participants, RR 2.15 (95% CI = 0.93 to 4.95), low-quality evidence). Although the occurrence of MDS (A rare syndrome caused by deletion of genetic material in the short arm of chromosome 17.) or AML (Clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in bone marrow, blood, and other tissue.) may increase with BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) escalated (3332 participants, RR 3.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 11.21); low-quality evidence)), there is no evidence for a difference between both regimens for overall secondary malignancies (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) (The transfer of a neoplasm from one organ or part of the body to another remote from the primary site.) (3332 participants, RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.48), low-quality evidence). However, the observation time of the studies included in the review is too short to be expected to demonstrate differences with respect to second solid tumours (A benign or malignant neoplasm arising from tissues that do not include fluid areas.) which would not be expected to show significance until around 15 years after treatment. We are very uncertain how many female patients will be infertile (A reduced or absent capacity to reproduce.) due to chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) and which arm might be favoured (106 participants, RR 1.37 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.26), very low-quality evidence). This is a very small sample, and the age of the patients was not detailed. No analysis of male fertility was provided. Five trials reported adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) and the analysis shows that the escalated BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) regimens probably causes more haematological toxicities WHO grade III or IV ((anaemia (A reduction in the number of circulating ERYTHROCYTES or in the quantity of HEMOGLOBIN.): 2425 participants, RR 10.67 (95% CI 7.14 to 15.93); neutropenia (A decrease in the number of LEUKOCYTES in a blood sample below the normal range (LEUKOCYTE COUNT less than 4000).): 519 participants, RR 1.80 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.13); thrombocytopenia (A subnormal level of BLOOD PLATELETS.): 2425 participants, RR 18.12 (95% CI 11.77 to 27.92); infections (The invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents and their multiplication, as well as the reaction by the host to these organisms and/or toxins that the organisms produce.): 2425 participants, RR 3.73 (95% CI 2.58 to 5.38), all low-quality evidence). Only one trial (EORTC 20012) planned to assess quality of life, however, no results were reported. This meta-analysis provides moderate- to high-quality evidence that adult patients between 16 and 60 years of age with early unfavourable and advanced stage HL (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) benefit regarding OS and PFS from first-line chemotherapy (The preferred standard treatment for a particular condition.) (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) including escalated BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.). The proven benefit in OS for patients with advanced HL (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) is a new finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.) of this updated review due to the inclusion of the results from the EORTC 20012 trial. Furthermore, there is only low-quality evidence of a difference in the total number of secondary malignancies (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) (The transfer of a neoplasm from one organ or part of the body to another remote from the primary site.), as the follow-up period might be too short to detect meaningful differences. Low-quality evidence also suggests that people treated with escalated BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) may have a higher risk to develop secondary AML (An acute myeloid leukemia secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome or therapy-related.) (Clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in bone marrow, blood, and other tissue.) or MDS (A rare syndrome caused by deletion of genetic material in the short arm of chromosome 17.). Due to the availability of only very low-quality evidence available, we are unable to come to a conclusion in terms of infertility (A reduced or absent capacity to reproduce.). This review does for the first time suggest a survival benefit. However, it is clear from this review that BEACOPP (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.) escalated may be more toxic that ABVD (An abbreviation for a chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) combination used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.), and very important long-term side effects of second malignancies (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) and infertility (A reduced or absent capacity to reproduce.) have not been sufficiently analysed yet.",

We analysed the following harms potentially caused by both regimens. There is no evidence for a difference for treatment-related mortality. There is evidence for a higher risk of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in patients receiving BEACOPP escalated, but the total number of secondary malignancies does not show evidence for a difference between both treatment groups.

Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG (This gene plays a role in cell motility.) increases the caesarean section (Extraction of the FETUS by means of abdominal HYSTEROTOMY.) rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG (This gene plays a role in cell motility.) not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour.

All four included trials were conducted in developed Western European countries. One additional study is ongoing. The usefulness of the findings of this review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices. However, an absence of benefit and likely harm associated with admission CTG (This gene plays a role in cell motility.) will have relevance for countries where questions are being asked about the role of the admission CTG (This gene plays a role in cell motility.). Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG (This gene plays a role in cell motility.) should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and before a formal diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of labour. This would include a cohort of women currently having admission CTG (This gene plays a role in cell motility.)s and not included in current trials.",

                "We compared the admission CTG with intermittent auscultation of the FHR performed on the woman's admission to the labour ward. We searched for evidence to 30 November 2016 but found no new studies for this updated review (previously published in 2012). This review includes four studies and there is one study that is not yet complete. The included studies (carried out in the UK and Ireland) involved more than 13,000 women with low-risk pregnancies. Three trials were funded by the hospitals were the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. Women allocated to admission CTG were probably more likely to have a caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of instrumental vaginal births (low quality evidence) or in numbers of babies who died during or shortly after labour (moderate quality evidence) between women in the two groups. Admission CTG was associated with an increase in the use of continuous EFM (with an electrode placed on the baby\u2019s scalp) (low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (a small blood sample taken from a baby's scalp) during labour. There were no differences in other outcomes measured such as artificial rupture of the membranes, augmentation of labour, use of an epidural, damage to the baby's brain due to lack of oxygen (very low quality evidence), or the baby having fits or seizures just after birth (low quality evidence). No studies reported if the babies developed any severe problems in brain or central nervous system growth and development after one year of age. Although many hospitals carry out CTGs on women when they are admitted to hospital in labour, we found no evidence that this benefits women with low-risk pregnancies. We found that admission CTGs may increase numbers of women having a caesarean section by about 20%. The included studies did not include enough women to show if admission CTGs or intermittent auscultation were better at keeping babies safe. However, studies to show which is better at keeping babies safe would have to be very large. Based on this review, low-risk pregnant women who have an admission CTG could be more likely to have a caesarean section. The benefits to these women of having an admission CTG are not certain. All of the included studies took place in developed Western European countries. The review findings might not be useful to people in very different countries or where different ways of FHR monitoring are used. However, countries that use admission CTGs should start to question why, because there are not clear benefits to using admission CTGs, and they could be causing women harm by making them more likely to have a caesarean section."

The review authors made a thorough search of the medical literature looking for controlled trials in which women receiving a first diagnosis of breast cancer were randomised to the intervention group. They retrieved 23 original reports of trials for further review but ultimately no trial could be included. A number of the trials focused on communication at the first treatment consultation rather than the method of delivering the diagnosis.

Due to the nature of the main intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s of interest, it was impossible to blind the therapists as to whether the participant was in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) or control arm. In addition, in three studies the blinding of participants was expressly forbidden by the local ethics committee because of issues in obtaining fully informed consent .

In general, there was a low risk of bias in the other domains. However, there was high heterogeneity and caution is required in interpreting these results. The wide variability in secondary outcome measures made it difficult to integrate findings from studies.

Hypnotherapy (induced through clinical guidance into a hypnotic state.) is also a possible alternative. However, these conclusions are limited by high heterogeneity in many of the results and low numbers of participants in individual studies. The evidence for other brief intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s was less clear.

There is no evidence to suggest that using special equipment for liver resection (Excision of all or part of the liver.) is of any benefit in decreasing the mortality, morbidity, or blood transfusion (The introduction of whole blood or blood component directly into the blood stream.) requirements (very low-quality evidence). Radiofrequency dissecting sealer should not be used outside the clinical trial setting since there is low-quality evidence for increased harm without any evidence of benefits. In addition, it should be noted that the sample size was small and the credible intervals were wide, and we cannot rule out considerable benefit or harm with a specific method of liver resection (Excision of all or part of the liver.).",

However, we were only able to include 5771 participants from 64 trials since investigators either did not include the remaining participants in the analysis or did not report any outcomes of interest. Source of funding: 24 trials (35.8%) were funded by parties with no financial interest in obtaining positive results for the treatment being evaluated. The remaining trials received funding from either parties who would gain financially from the results of the study or did not report the funding. All the trials were at high risk of bias, that is, investigators may have overestimated the benefits or underestimated the harms of one method or the other because of the way that the studies were conducted. Many trials included few participants, and there was a good chance of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of this. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low. There was no evidence of differences in most of the comparisons, and where there was, these differences were in single trials, mostly of small sample size. Such evidence is unreliable. So, we mention only the evidence that was available in more than one trial. Of the primary outcomes, the only one where there was evidence of difference was in the number of adverse events, which was higher with radiofrequency dissecting sealer than with clamp-crush method. Among the secondary outcomes, the only evidence of difference was in the following: Blood transfusion (percentage): higher in the low central venous pressure group than in the acute normovolemic haemodilution (diluting the blood by giving fluids during operation) plus low central venous pressure group. Blood transfusion amount: lower in the fibrin sealant group (a type of glue applied to the cut surface of the liver) than in the control. Blood transfusion (fresh frozen plasma \u2212 a component of blood): higher in the oxidised cellulose (another type of glue applied to the cut surface of the liver) group than in the fibrin sealant group. Blood loss, total hospital stay, and operating time: lower with the low central venous pressure group than control. For other comparisons, the evidence for difference was based on single small trials, or there was no evidence of differences. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life or time needed to return to work. There is no evidence to suggest that using special equipment for liver resection is of any benefit."

                "Standard diagnosis of malaria in the past has depended on blood microscopy, but this requires a technician and a laboratory, and is often not feasible for basic health services in many areas. Sometimes in research studies, another technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used, but again this requires equipment and trained staff, and cannot be used routinely. Technological advances have led to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria. These detect parasite-specific antigens in the blood, are simple to use, and can give results as a simple positive or negative result, within 15 minutes. This review evaluates the accuracy of RDTs compared with microscopy and PCR for detecting Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the blood. It includes 74 studies, giving a total of 111 RDT evaluations (of which 104 compared RDTs with microscopy), reporting a total of 60,396 RDT results. Results are presented by type of test, classified by the malaria antigen that they are designed to detect (either histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), or plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)). The results indicate that RDTs can be very accurate compared to microscopy and PCR. The performance of RDT types varied but the differences were not large. HRP-2-based tests tended to be more sensitive (ie they identified more true cases of malaria) and less specific (ie they wrongly identified more malaria that was not present) than pLDH-based tests. Choice will depend on prevalence of malaria, and we provide data in this review to assist these decisions, although policy makers will also take into account other factors relating to cost and test stability."

There was no significant difference in virologic suppression in the included studies (Milinkovic 2007; McComsey 2008; Sanchez-Conde 2005); Risk Ratio (RR) 1.09 (95% CI: 0.93 to 1.28), 0.94 (95% CI:0.59 to 1.50) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.18) respectively. Symptomatic hyperlactatemia (Increase in blood LACTATE concentration often associated with SEPTIC SHOCK; LUNG INJURY; SEPSIS; and DRUG TOXICITY.) was seen in the high dose arm of the Milinkovic 2007 study; RR 0.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 4.66), in no participants in the McComsey 2008 trial and not reported on in the Sanchez-Conde 2005 trial. McComsey 2008 and Milinkovic 2007 demonstrated a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), reduction in limb fat (The farthest or outermost projections of the body, such as the HAND and FOOT.) and an increase in triglyceride (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.)s (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.) in the high dose arms. The studies did not indicate that any participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). This systematic review identified only three small trials that evaluated virologic efficacy and safety of high dose versus low dose stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.). All three trials were conducted in developed countries and none reported from developing countries yet stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.) remains a component of ART combination therapy (The treatment of a disease or condition by several different means simultaneously or sequentially.) in many developing countries. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis on these trails. Individual results from the trials were imprecise and have not identified a clear advantage in virologic efficacy or safety between low and high dose stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.). Furthermore, enrolled participants were treatment experienced with sustained virologic suppression and so existing data cannot be generalized to settings where stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.) is currently used in ART naive patients with high viral loads. Stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.) dose reduction trials in ART naive patients, in developing countries where stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.) is still being used are warranted as the phasing out of stavudine (A dideoxynucleoside analog that inhibits reverse transcriptase and has in vitro activity against HIV.) that is recommended by WHO may not be immediately universally feasible.",

                "The comprehensive search strategy developed by the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group was used to identify trials that compared the safety and efficacy in suppressing the viral load of low dose versus high dose stavudine in the context of treating HIV-1 with combination antiretroviral therapy. The searches covered the period 1996 to 2014.The search identified 3952 trials and only three met the inclusion criteria, all the included trials were conducted in developed countries, the number of participants ranged from 24 to 92 and the majority were male. The efficacy of suppressing the viral load was found to be the same in all the trials whether high dose or low dose of stavudine was used. McComsey 2008 and Milinkovic 2007 demonstrated a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), reduction in limb fat and an increase in triglycerides in the high dose arms. While there was no demonstration of a difference in efficacy of viral load suppression between high dose and low dose stavudine in the included trials, participants included in these trials were already treated with antiretroviral therapy and had suppressed viral load. The fact that participants already had suppression of the viral load and the studies were small, meant it would be difficult to demonstrate the differences in viral load suppression between the two groups. The studies did not indicate that any participants discontinued treatment due to adverse events. This review identified only trials that tested the safety and efficacy in suppressing the viral load of low dose compared to high dose stavudine. These trials were small, conducted in developed countries and included participants with suppressed viral loads that had been on antiretroviral treatment for a long time. Individual results from the trials have not identified a clear advantage in viral load suppression or safety between low and high dose stavudine.Studies that evaluate the safety and efficacy in viral load suppression need to be conducted particularly in developing countries where stavudine is still being used and probably needed to either sustain treatment programs or where alternatives are limited."

Peak Expiratory Flow (The maximum rate of gas flow, beginning at the point of peak inspiratory capacity, that can be sustained during forced exhalation for a defined period of time.) outcome data in two studies, (51 patients), indicated a significant difference in favour of bio-feedback therapy (The therapy technique of providing the status of one's own AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM function (e.g., skin temperature, heartbeats, brain waves) as visual or auditory feedback in order to self-control related conditions (e.g., hypertension, migraine headaches).)

Larger, well-conducted and reported randomised trials are required in this area, in order to determine the effects of these techniques in the treatment of asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) in adults.",

We failed to find clinically significant differences between individual benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.). The majority of studies did not report details on random sequence generation and allocation concealment; similarly, no details were provided about strategies to ensure blinding. The study protocol was not available for almost all studies so it is difficult to make a judgment on the possibility of outcome reporting bias. Information on adverse effects was very limited. The identified studies are not sufficient to comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. The majority of studies enrolled a small number of participants and did not provide data for all the outcomes specified in the protocol. For these reasons most of the analyses were underpowered and this limits the overall completeness of evidence. In general, based on the results of the current review, the possible role of antidepressant (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.)s (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.) and benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) should be assessed by the clinician on an individual basis. The choice of which antidepressant (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.) and/or benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) is prescribed can not be made on the basis of this review only, and should be based on evidence of antidepressant (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.)s (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.) and benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) efficacy and tolerability, including data from placebo-controlled studies, as a whole. Data on long-term tolerability issues associated with antidepressant (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.)s (Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.) and benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) exposure should also be carefully considered.

The quality of the available evidence was mainly low, meaning that further research would be very likely to have an important impact on these results. Studies with larger sample sizes and fewer risks of bias should be carried out, with head-to-head comparisons. Longer-term outcomes need to be addressed to establish whether the effect is transient or durable. Trials should better report any harms experienced by participants during the trial.

Outcomes were assessed immediately after the end of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)

Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to a serious risk of bias, serious indirectness of the included population and serious level of imprecision. Two of the ITS studies evaluated the implementation of an advertising ban and one study evaluated the lifting of such a ban. Each of the three ITS studies evaluated a different type of ban (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period. The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of the two studies that evaluated the implementation of a ban showed an overall mean non-significant increase in beer consumption in the general population of 1.10% following the ban (95% CI -5.26, 7.47; p value = 0.43; I2 = 83%, very-low-quality evidence). This finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.) is consistent with an increase, no difference, or a decrease in alcohol (A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body.) consumption.

Using the GRADE approach, the evidence from the ITS studies was rated as very low due to a high risk of bias arising from a lack of randomisation and imprecision in the results. No other prespecified outcomes (including economic loss or hardship due to decreased alcohol (A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body.) sales) were addressed in the included studies and no adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.

ITS studies are studies in which changes, usually in the general public, are measured at various points before, during and after an intervention such as a change in policy.

The data arising from the included studies did not show a clear effect either for or against the banning or restriction of alcohol advertising. In the RCT, young men who watched movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men who watched movies with a high-alcohol content. Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol drank less. The trial was one and a half hours, so we do not know how long beyond the trial these effects lasted. The trial did not report on any harmful outcomes. The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent. We statistically combined the results of the two studies that assessed what happened after a ban was introduced. This showed an overall increase in beer consumption in the general population following the introduction of the ban, but the results were uncertain and could also be consistent with no difference or an overall decrease in alcohol consumption. The third ITS study, which evaluated the lifting of a total ban on all forms of alcohol advertising to a ban on spirits advertising only, also found uncertain results. None of the studies reported on any harms arising from the bans. Overall we judged the quality of evidence to be very low in the RCT. This was based on the fact that there were problems with the study methodology, the population included men only and the results were not very accurate. In the ITS studies, the quality was also judged to be very low due to problems with the study methodology and the results not being precise. The review cannot recommend for or against banning alcohol advertising. Governments that are considering implementing alcohol advertising bans would be advised to implement the ban in a research environment and monitor the effects over time to build the evidence base."

Similarly, meta-analysis of weight gain in g/d based on two studies showed no evidence of difference (WMD 2.09 g/d, 95% CI -1.46, 5.64). Length gain, based on five studies, showed a non-significant WMD of 0.14 cm/wk (95% CI -0.04, 0.31). Head circumference gain, based on data from five studies, showed a non-significant WMD -0.03 cm/wk (95% CI -0.15, 0.08). Only one study reported a statistically non-significant skin fold thickness gain, with a mean difference -0.15 mm/wk (95% CI -0.41, 0.11). Subgroup analyses according to % MCT in the high MCT formula, by 10% intervals showed no evidence of effect of high MCT on short-term weight gain within any subgroup.

We did not identify any trials that used transabdominal amnioinfusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.)

We included one small study that reported on a limited number of outcomes of interest in this review. The numbers included in this review are too small for meaningful assessment of substantive outcomes, where reported. For those outcomes we assessed using GRADE (postpartum endometritis (Infection of the endometrium, decidua and/or myometrium occurring at any time between birth and 42 days postpartum.), neonatal infection (An illness caused by an infectious agent or its toxins that occurs through the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent or its products from an infected individual or via an animal, vector or the inanimate environment to a susceptible animal or human host.), and caesarean section (Extraction of the FETUS by means of abdominal HYSTEROTOMY.)), we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low - with downgrading decisions based on small numbers and a lack of information on blinding. The included study did not report on this review's other primary outcome (perinatal death or severe morbidity). The reduction in pyrexia (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.), though not a pre-specified outcome of this review, may be of relevance in terms of benefits to the fetus of reduced exposure to heat. We postulate that the temperature reduction found may be a direct cooling effect of amnioinfusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.)

Themother's temperature at delivery, which was not a pre-defined outcome for our review, was lower in the women who received amnioinfusion, by 0.38 \u00b0C (with a likely range of 0.74 lower to 0.02 lower). The outcomedeath or severe illness in the babywas not reported, nor did the study report on the number of babies with alow Apgar scoreafter they were born (a low Apgar score could indicate that the baby is in need of medical attention). Similarly, the majority of other outcomes listed in this review were not reported in the included study. We did not identify any studies that looked at introducing the solution through the mother's abdomen (transabdominal route). There is not enough evidence to support the use of amnioinfusion for chorioamnionitis in clinical practice. We suggest that the reduction in temperature may have been in part due to a direct cooling effect of the infused fluid, and that further research is justified to determine whether such a cooling effect may be beneficial for the baby. Further randomised controlled trials are needed in this area. Future trials should compare transabdominal or transcervical amnioinfusion with no amnioinfusion for women with pregnancy fluid and sac infection (chorioamnionitis) and report on important outcomes listed in this review."

These studies compared amphetamines to placebo (something that looks like an amphetamine but with no active ingredient), and three studies also compared amphetamines with other drugs such as guanfacine, modafinil, and paroxetine. In this review, we assessed the effects of three different kinds of amphetamines: dexamphetamine (from 10.2 to 21.8 mg/d), lisdexamfetamine (from 30 to 70 mg/d), and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) (from 12.5 to 80 mg/d). Treatment length ranged from one to 20 weeks. Eighteen studies were conducted in the USA and one study in Canada and the USA. Ten studies were conducted at multiple sites. Study funding was reported in all but two studies. Sixteen studies were funded by the manufacturer, and one was funded by government agencies. All amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by patients. Lisdexamfetamine and MAS also reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians, but dexamphetamine did not. Overall, amphetamines did not make people more likely to stay in treatment and were associated with higher risk of treatment ending early as the result of adverse events. We found no evidence suggesting that higher doses worked better than lower ones. We did not find any difference in effectiveness between amphetamines that act for longer periods of time versus those that act for shorter periods of time. Therefore, it appears that short-term treatment with amphetamines reduces the severity of ADHD symptoms, but studies assessing the effects of amphetamines for longer periods of time are needed. We found no differences in effectiveness between amphetamines and guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine. The quality of the evidence was low to very low for all outcomes for several reasons, namely, it was possible for patients to know the treatment they were taking; the number of studies and included patients was low, leading to imprecise results for many outcomes; the studies had problems in their design; and, for some outcomes, results varied across trials."

The evidence is current to February 2015. There is a small amount of evidence supporting this link but it is not of high quality and may not be reliable. This update of a review sought high quality evidence from randomised controlled trials (studies where participants are randomly allocated to receive one of several treatments) on vitamin D for chronic painful conditions. We found no consistent pattern that vitamin D treatment was better than placebo for any chronic painful condition, but the studies had methodological shortcomings (low quality evidence). More research is needed to determine if vitamin D is a useful pain treatment in any particular chronic painful condition. That research should examine whether any effect is restricted to people who are vitamin D deficient. It should also examine how much vitamin D is required, and for how long, before beneficial effects occur."

The review analysed data from 12 studies, which showed that there is limited evidence to support the routine use of PTCRA for in-stent re-stenosis; however, only for those people who were not suitable for surgery. For those with complex lesions, PTCRA may provide some benefit in comparison to balloon angioplasty. The review also showed that patients receiving PTCRA were more likely to have perforations during the procedure compared to patients receiving balloon angioplasty. This review was limited by the small number of studies and deficiency of data reported in some of the studies."

No serious side effects were reported by any of the studies. One study showed that in patients suffering from atelectasis, a severe complication of bronchiolitis wherein the lung does not expand completely, nebulised rhDNase treatment resulted in a distinct improvement within two days.

Findings into the efficacy of memantine offer supportive evidence for preventing cognitive deficits in patients with a secondary brain tumour receiving brain irradiation. Findings into the efficacy of donepezil offer some support for its use in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in patients with a primary or secondary tumour previously treated with radiation.

                "The hormones oestrogen and progesterone have established physiological roles in maintaining pregnancy. It has been suggested that supplementation of these hormones could help prevent miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy, particularly in women who have low levels of the hormones, in assisted reproductive technology programs, or who have a history of repeated miscarriages. In our review of randomised controlled trials published in major scientific databases, we only identified two trials that met our inclusion criteria. The two trials involved small numbers of women. One involved 161 women with diabetes who took oral placebo or oral diethylstilboestrol and ethisterone in increasing doses from before the end of the 16th week until birth. The other trial involved 120 women with pregnancy assisted by in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer who continued treatment until the completed 12th week of gestation. From the little evidence available, the two trials found no evidence that combined oestrogen and progestogen can prevent miscarriage (progestogen is a major class of hormones which includes progesterone) when compared with placebo or usual care. The first of the two studies indicated an increased risk for the mothers who used hormonal therapy during pregnancy of developing cancer later in life. Diethylstilboestrol is no longer in use and poses serious adverse effects while ethisterone contains androgenic properties thought to be responsible for genital abnormalities and has been replaced by progesterone. Overall, we acknowledge the lack of trials, especially large-scale trials, and therefore suggest further research is needed in this area before supporting or disproving the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for the prevention of miscarriages."

There has been doubt about the effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care, and hence the impetus to do this review. Through extensive searches of the literature we found 14 studies conducted in adults (not the elderly) in primary care setting, in which tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were compared against a placebo control group in the treatment of depression. The results showed that both TCAs and SSRIs were effective for depression. Most of the studies were supported by funds from pharmaceutical companies and were of short duration. There appeared to be more adverse effects with TCAs than with SSRIs, however rates of withdrawal from study medication due to adverse effects were very similar between the two antidepressant classes. Adverse effects not leading to medication cessation seemed to be more common with TCAs than SSRIs."

A single oral dose of ibuprofen 200 mg or 400 mg is effective in relieving pain in migraine headaches. Pain will be reduced from moderate or severe to no pain by two hours in just over 1 in 4 people (26%) taking ibuprofen 400 mg, compared with about 1 in 10 (12%) taking placebo. It will be reduced from moderate or severe to no worse than mild pain by two hours in roughly 1 in 2 people (57%) taking ibuprofen compared with approximately 1 in 4 (25%) taking placebo. Of those who experience effective headache relief at two hours, more have that relief sustained over 24 hours with ibuprofen than with placebo. A 200-mg dose is slightly less effective, while soluble formulations give more rapid responses. A single 400-mg dose of ibuprofen has efficacy similar to that shown for a single dose of 1000 mg aspirin in a separate Cochrane review (Kirthi 2013). Adverse events are mostly mild and transient, occurring in the same proportion of participants treated with ibuprofen and placebo. Very few individuals had serious adverse events or needed to withdraw from these studies because of adverse events. There is no information for ibuprofen combined with a self-administered antiemetic, and little information comparing ibuprofen with other medications.

The review found that, in general, there was uncertainty whether different OTC (A medicine or device that can be bought without a doctor's order or prescription.) artificial tears provide similar relief of signs and symptoms when compared with each other or placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.). Nevertheless, we found that 0.2% polyacrylic (white, water soluable polymer based on acrylamide; used as a thickening or suspending agent in water based formulations.) acid-based artificial tears were consistently more effective at treating dry eye (Corneal and conjunctival dryness due to deficient tear production, predominantly in menopausal and post-menopausal women.) symptoms (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) than 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based (A polymer prepared from polyvinyl acetates by replacement of the acetate groups with hydroxyl groups.) artificial tears in two trials assessing this comparison (175 participants).

Our review also found that OTC (A medicine or device that can be bought without a doctor's order or prescription.) artificial tears may be generally safe, but not without adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). Overall, we assessed the quality of evidence as low due to high risks of bias among included trials and poor reporting of outcome measures which were insufficient for quantitative analysis. Furthermore, we identified an additional 18 potentially eligible trials that were reported only in clinical trial registers with no associated results or publications.

For the prespecified index tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.), we found six studies for the Mallampati test, 105 for the modified Mallampati test, six for the Wilson risk score, 52 for thyromental distance, 18 for sternomental distance, 34 for the mouth opening test, and 30 for the upper lip bite test.

Across all studies, we judged the risk of bias to be variable for the different domains; we mostly observed low risk of bias for patient selection, flow and timing, and unclear risk of bias for reference standard and index test. Applicability concerns were generally low for all domains. For difficult laryngoscopy (Examination, therapy or surgery of the interior of the larynx performed with a specially designed endoscope.), the summary sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) ranged from 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.33; mouth opening test) to 0.67 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.83; upper lip bite test) and the summary specificity ranged from 0.80 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.85; modified Mallampati test) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.98; Wilson risk score). The upper lip bite test for diagnosing (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) difficult laryngoscopy (Examination, therapy or surgery of the interior of the larynx performed with a specially designed endoscope.) provided the highest sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) compared to the other tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.)

Screening tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) are expected to have high sensitivities.

In contrast, specificities were consistently and markedly higher than sensitivities across all tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.).

For difficult face mask ventilation (another indication of a difficult airway), there were only enough data to calculate average sensitivity of 17% and specificity 90% for the modified Mallampati test. Overall, the evidence from the studies was of moderate to high quality. The likelihood of the studies providing reliable results was generally high, although in half of them, the intubating physician knew the result of the preceding test, which may have influenced results, but this is the normal situation in routine clinical care. The characteristics of patients, tests, and conditions were comparable to those seen in a wide range of everyday clinical settings. The results of this review should apply to standard preoperative airway assessments in apparently normal hospital patients worldwide.

Nearly all studies reported a shortened duration of diarrhoea and reduced stool frequency in people who received probiotics compared to the controls. Overall, probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea by around 25 hours, the risk of diarrhoea lasting four or more days by 59% and resulted in about one fewer diarrhoeal stool on day 2 after the intervention.

The study compared nidotherapy with standard care versus standard care alone and lasted 18 months.\u00a0Findings suggest some limited evidence that those who received nidotherapy might experience a slight improvement in social functioning or personal relationships, mental state and may spend less time as inpatients in hospital over the course of 12 months, but there is no information concerning the appropriateness of this for the individual.\u00a0However, these limited findings need to be treated with considerable caution. The degree of any possible improvements that come from taking part in nidotherapy remain unclear due to the single study\u2019s small sample size, incomplete evidence and risk of bias.\u00a0No evidence is available on the effect of nidotherapy on general functioning, quality of life, taking medication, satisfaction with treatment, employment status or adverse effects. Further research is required to fill this gap in knowledge about the effectiveness, benefits and possible hazards of nidotherapy.\u00a0Until such a time, people with mental health problems, health professionals, managers and policymakers should consider this new therapy an experimental one.

We included eight studies. Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect. Pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)). Substantial benefit with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), but about 9% more with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence). Pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence). Moderate benefit with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), but about 11% more with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence). A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC (The determination of the amount of pepsinogen I present in a sample.) of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'. NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence). A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.), and concluded there was no difference in effect. Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration (Titration), 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) relief after titration (Titration) were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) daily) or a short down-titration (Titration) to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) for 13 or 26 weeks. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR (This gene plays a role in methionine biosynthesis.)) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. Of those randomised, 40% had MTR (This gene plays a role in methionine biosynthesis.) with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) and 20% with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (high quality evidence). The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR (This gene plays a role in methionine biosynthesis.) outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. MTR (This gene plays a role in methionine biosynthesis.) had no imputation concerns. The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). Specific adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were more common with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) than placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), in particular dizziness (An imprecise term which may refer to a sense of spatial disorientation, motion of the environment, or lightheadedness.), somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema (Swelling due to an excessive accumulation of fluid in the upper or lower extremities.), with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence). Serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (very low quality evidence). Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) than placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design. Withdrawals due to adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were about 10% higher with pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) than placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence). Pregabalin (A drug used to treat nerve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) caused by diabetes or herpes zoster infection and certain types of seizures.) 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.)) with moderate or severe pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) due to fibromyalgia (A common nonarticular rheumatic syndrome characterized by myalgia and multiple points of focal muscle tenderness to palpation (trigger points).). The degree of pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) relief is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function. These results are similar to other effective medicines (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) in fibromyalgia (A common nonarticular rheumatic syndrome characterized by myalgia and multiple points of focal muscle tenderness to palpation (trigger points).) (milnacipran (used in the treatment of FIBROMYALGIA.), duloxetine (A drug used to treat depression and peripheral neuropathy (pain, numbness, tingling, burning, or weakness in the hands or feet) that can occur with diabetes.)).",

                "We searched scientific databases for studies that looked at the effects of pregabalin in adults with fibromyalgia who had moderate or severe pain. The treatment had to last at least eight weeks. The evidence is current to March 2016. Eight studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, including three new studies for this update. Five studies randomised 3283 participants to immediate treatment with pregabalin or placebo. Two studies identified 687 out of 1492 participants who had a good pain response and could take the medicine, and then randomised them to continued treatment with pregabalin or placebo. Study quality was good. One other had no useful data. High quality evidence showed that 1 in 10 people with moderate or severe fibromyalgia pain reported a large fall in pain by a third to a half over 12 to 26 weeks. This is an outcome that people with fibromyalgia consider to be useful. The dose of pregabalin was 300 to 600 mg daily. Side effects occurred in 8 or 9 people in 10, often while adjusting to the medicine. Particular side effects were dizziness (affecting 1 in 4 participants), drowsiness (1 in 7), weight gain (1 in 18), and peripheral oedema (1 in 19) (high quality evidence). Serious side effects were no more common with pregabalin than with placebo, affecting 1 or 2 in 100. About 1 in 10 more participants taking pregabalin withdrew from the study because of side effects, and 1 in 17 fewer withdrew because the medicine was not working. The evidence was mostly of high quality, which means we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect in this review. Concern about how information was handled when people left the studies was offset by other information showing that results were not impacted by this to any important degree."

Women receiving magnesium sulphate were more likely to feel warm and flushed in this study than women who received a placebo, but they were not more likely to stop treatment due to side effects. The rates of haemorrhage after birth and rates of caesarean birth were similar for women who received magnesium sulphate and those who received a placebo. More studies are needed to establish whether magnesium sulphate given to the mother at term is protective for the baby's brain.

However this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s.

We judged blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment to be at high risk in about 50% of the included studies and at low risk in 25% to 30% of the studies. Regardless of the high risk of performance bias these studies were included based on the low weight the studies had in the meta-analysis. We rated 75% of the studies as low risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias. All 13 studies reported some type of hospital mortality (28-day, 30-day, 60-day or ICU mortality). We considered studies of high-risk surgery patients (eight studies) and general intensive care patients (five studies) separately as subgroups for meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality for the studies of general intensive care patients was 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.09) and for the studies of high-risk surgery patients the RR was 0.98 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.29). Of the eight studies of high-risk surgery patients, five evaluated the effectiveness of pre-operative optimization but there was no difference in mortality when these studies were examined separately. PAC (A type of cardiac arrhythmia with premature atrial contractions or beats caused by signals originating from ectopic atrial sites.) did not affect general ICU LOS (reported by four studies) or hospital LOS (reported by nine studies). Four studies, conducted in the United States (US (The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues.)), reported costs based on hospital charges billed, which on average were higher in the PAC (A type of cardiac arrhythmia with premature atrial contractions or beats caused by signals originating from ectopic atrial sites.) groups.

Our review concluded that use of a PAC (A type of cardiac arrhythmia with premature atrial contractions or beats caused by signals originating from ectopic atrial sites.) did not alter the mortality, general ICU or hospital LOS, or cost for adult patients in intensive care. The quality of evidence was high for mortality and LOS but low for cost analysis. Efficacy studies are needed to determine if there are optimal PAC (A type of cardiac arrhythmia with premature atrial contractions or beats caused by signals originating from ectopic atrial sites.)-guided management protocols, which when applied to specific patient groups in ICUs could result in benefits such as shock (A pathological condition manifested by failure to perfuse or oxygenate vital organs.) reversal, improved organ function and less vasopressor (Drugs used to cause constriction of the blood vessels.) use. Newer, less-invasive haemodynamic (Actions performed to support the movement of solutions through the blood) monitoring tools need to be validated against PAC (A type of cardiac arrhythmia with premature atrial contractions or beats caused by signals originating from ectopic atrial sites.) prior to clinical use in critically ill (possible or imminent.) patients.",

We analysed the studies for any trial related risks and performed appropriate statistical analysis to minimize any risk of bias or errors. The quality of evidence is high from this review and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect except for cost analysis. Our review found that there were no differences in the number of deaths during hospital stay, days spent in general ICUs, and days spent in hospital between patients who did and did not have a PAC inserted. Two US studies were analysed for hospital cost associated with or without a PAC and showed no difference in the cost. Neither group of patients studied showed any evidence of benefit or harm from using a PAC. The catheter is a monitoring tool that helps in diagnosis and is not a treatment modality. Insertion of PACs to help make treatment decisions in ICU patients should be individualized and should be done by experts in the field after adequate training in the interpretation of data.

No two studies compared the same intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. Most studies had a high risk of bias due to poor study design, broad inclusion criteria, low patient numbers and industry involvement. Based on low certainty evidence, thrombolytic therapy (Use of infusions of FIBRINOLYTIC AGENTS to destroy or dissolve thrombi in blood vessels or bypass grafts.) may restore catheter function when compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (149 participants: RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.56) but there is no data available to suggest an optimal dose or administration method. The certainty of this evidence is reduced due to the fact that it is based on only a single study with wide confidence limits, high risk of bias and imprecision in the estimates of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (149 participants: RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.73). Based on the available evidence, physical disruption of a fibrin sheath (The double-layered skin fold that covers the GLANS PENIS, the head of the penis.) using intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)al radiology techniques appears to be equally efficacious as the use of a pharmaceutical (Completed forms of the pharmaceutical preparation in which prescribed doses of medication are included.) thrombolytic agent (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.) for the immediate management of dysfunctional catheters (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.) (57 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). Catheter patency is poor following use of thrombolytic agent (Fibrinolysin or agents that convert plasminogen to FIBRINOLYSIN.)s with studies reporting median catheter survival rates of 14 to 42 days and was reported to improve significantly by fibrin sheath (The double-layered skin fold that covers the GLANS PENIS, the head of the penis.) stripping (A removal done by peeling, often using a stripper) or catheter exchange (37 participants: MD -27.70 days, 95% CI -51.00 to -4.40). Catheter exchange was reported to be superior to sheath (The double-layered skin fold that covers the GLANS PENIS, the head of the penis.) disruption with respect to catheter survival (30 participants: MD 213.00 days, 95% CI 205.70 to 220.30). There is insufficient evidence to suggest any specific intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) is superior in terms of ensuring either dialysis adequacy or reduced risk of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). Thrombolysis, fibrin sheath (The double-layered skin fold that covers the GLANS PENIS, the head of the penis.) disruption and over-the-wire catheter exchange are effective and appropriate therapies (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for immediately restoring catheter patency in dysfunctional cuffed and tunnelled HD (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) catheters (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.). On current data there is no evidence to support physical intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) over the use of pharmaceutical (Completed forms of the pharmaceutical preparation in which prescribed doses of medication are included.) agents (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.) in the acute setting. Pharmacological intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s appear to have a bridging role and long-term catheter survival may be improved by fibrin sheath (The double-layered skin fold that covers the GLANS PENIS, the head of the penis.) disruption and is probably superior following catheter exchange. There is no evidence favouring any of these approaches with respect to dialysis adequacy or risk of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). The current review is limited by the small number of available studies with limited numbers of patients enrolled. Most of the studies included in this review were judged to have a high risk of bias and were potentially influenced by pharmaceutical (Completed forms of the pharmaceutical preparation in which prescribed doses of medication are included.) industry involvement.

The quality of evidence is limited by small study size and high risk of bias. Thrombolytic therapy was probably better than placebo at restoring catheter function but there was no optimal dose or administration method. Physical disruption of a fibrin sheath may be equally effective as pharmaceutical thrombolytic agent for immediate management of catheter dysfunction. Catheter patency at two weeks is probably better following fibrin sheath stripping or catheter exchange compared to thrombolytic agent. Catheter exchange may be better than sheath disruption for long-term catheter survival and the use of both techniques together is probably best.

Among the three that did not show significant decreases, one demonstrated a significant intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) effect on smokers and ex-smokers combined. There is evidence that comprehensive tobacco control programmes which include mass media campaigns can be effective in changing smoking behaviour in adults, but the evidence comes from a heterogeneous group of studies of variable methodological quality. One state-wide tobacco control programme (Massachusetts) showed positive results up to eight years after the campaign. Another (California) showed positive results during the period of adequate funding and implementation and in final evaluation since the beginning of the programme. Six of nine studies carried out in communities or regions showed some positive effects on smoking behaviour and at least one significant change in smoking prevalence (Sydney). The intensity and duration of mass media campaigns may influence effectiveness, but length of follow-up and concurrent secular trends and events can make this difficult to quantify. No consistent relationship was observed between campaign effectiveness and age, education, ethnicity or gender.",

                "We searched up until 30th November 2016, and found 11 relevant studies for this review. The numbers of participants varied between the included studies. All of the studies involved adults, although some studies also included younger people (14+ or 15+). Campaigns involved TV, radio, print media and billboard advertising. Studies differed in setting, duration, content of the intervention, length of observation, measures of smoking behaviour and the way of showing results. Two campaigns reported definite decreases in smoking prevalence, and some positive effects were observed in another three. Three large-scale campaigns reported lower tobacco consumption. Three studies showed some positive effect in abstinence or quit rates. One study did not show significant decreases but did demonstrate an effect of the intervention on smokers and ex-smokers combined. Tobacco control programmes that include mass media campaigns may change smoking behaviour in adults, but the evidence comes from studies of variable quality and scale and often occur in an environment where there are other influences on smoking, making it hard to isolate the effects of the media campaign itself. No consistent patterns by age, education, ethnicity or gender were found. There were problems with the design and conduct of all of the studies, which clouded the evidence. It would help if future studies could include comparator communities where there are no mass media interventions taking place to get a better estimate of the effect of the mass media campaign."

We found that women in 11 studies had completed surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy; women in three studies were currently undergoing chemotherapy; and women in five studies were currently undergoing radiotherapy. Women in the remaining five studies were either undergoing treatment or were not. Studies used a variety of questionnaires to assess quality of life, depression, fatigue and/or sleep disturbances. We found that yoga was more effective than no therapy in improving quality of life and reducing fatigue and sleep disturbances. We also found that yoga was better for reducing depression, anxiety and fatigue in women when compared with psychosocial or educational interventions such as counselling. We are fairly certain that these observed results are probably true. Yoga might be as effective as exercise in improving quality of life and reducing fatigue; we do not have enough data to be sure. Studies have poorly reported risks of yoga. However, we found no evidence of serious risks of yoga among women with a diagnosis of breast cancer. No studies have assessed effects of yoga in women given a diagnosis of breast cancer more than five years ago. Our findings indicate that women with a diagnosis of breast cancer can use yoga as supportive therapy for improving their quality of life and mental health, in addition to standard cancer treatments."

                "We looked for studies involving adults with gliomas that compared current practice of doing scans at specific time points with other approaches. We found only one study meeting our criteria. This was from a cancer centre in the USA, looking at glioblastoma patients (those with the most aggressive gliomas) who had been treated between 2006 and 2016. The study involved 125 people and split them into those scanned within two days of surgery (early scan) with those who were not. They showed that doing the early scan made no change to the chance of being alive at one and two years after diagnosis. This might have been because the early scans were not used to change treatments, which mainly were to receive standard radiotherapy and temozolomide, and we could not tell if the patients' surgeon(s) were different or had different approaches to care. We judged this suggestion of little change in survival time with or without early scanning to be very uncertain. The number of people included over 10 years was small, and the decision whether or not to have a scan after surgery was based on surgeon's choice. It was not clear whether the surgeon(s) involved or their approaches to care differed, nor whether a person's care might have been changed in light of early imaging. The other search did not find any studies looking at the value of different imaging approaches. We still do not know whether doing scans regularly at specific times after glioma diagnosis changes how well patients do. The limited evidence, suggesting early scans after operations do not affect survival, is unreliable and more research is needed, especially as early scans may also help surgeons improve their practice, and decide whether to repeat the operation earlier than they might otherwise have chosen to do. The best timings and reasons for scanning brain gliomas in adults are not known. Lessons might be learned from studies involving children, and by looking at large collections of clinical trials. It is also important to study the potential costs and benefits of different strategies."

We inspected these reports and found they referred to three trials, randomising people with schizophrenia to receive chlorpromazine or metiapine. Main results Our review now includes three studies with 161 participants. The studies revealed no real differences between chlorpromazine and metiapine for improvement in global state or incidence of parkinsonism (an umbrella term for symptoms such as tremor (shaking), bradykinesia (slow movement), rigidity (stiffness), and postural instability (difficulty in balancing). No data were reported for our other main areas of interest: mental state, service use, satisfaction with treatment, behaviour or cost of care. Conclusions We cannot draw firm conclusions from the data provided. The number of studies and number of participants in each study is small, all studies are also short term. Therefore, we rated the reported evidence as very low quality. However, metiapine is not a highly prescribed or used antipsychotic medicine, so although our evidence is poor, it probably will remain the best available evidence as it is unlikely new trials comparing metiapine with chlorpromazine will be conducted in the future."

                "We found seven studies that examined five talking therapies among 825 people with drug problems. Cognitive-behavioural coping skills training (CBCST) is a talking therapy that focuses on changing the way people think and act. The twelve-step programme is based on theories from Alcoholics Anonymous and aims to motivate the person to develop a desire to stop using drugs or alcohol. Motivational interviewing (MI) helps people to explore and resolve doubts about changing their behaviour. It can be delivered in group, individual and intensive formats. Brief motivational interviewing (BMI) is a shorter MI that takes 45 minutes to three hours. Brief interventions are based on MI but they take only five to 30 minutes and are often delivered by a non-specialist. Six of the studies were funded by the National Institutes for Health or by the Health Research Board; one study did not report its funding source. We found that the talking therapies led to no differences, or only small differences, for the outcomes assessed. These included abstinence, reduced drinking, and substance use. One study found that there may be no difference between CBCST and the twelve-step programme. Three studies found that there may be no difference between brief intervention and usual treatment. Three studies found that there may be no difference between MI and usual treatment or education only. One study found that BMI is probably better at reducing alcohol use than usual treatment (needle exchange), but found no differences in other outcomes. One study found that intensive MI may be somewhat better than standard MI at reducing severity of alcohol use disorder among women, but not among men and found no differences in other outcomes. It remains uncertain whether talking therapies reduce alcohol and drug use in people who also have problems with other drugs. High-quality studies are missing and are needed. The quality of the evidence was moderate for brief and intensive motivational interviewing, but low for brief interventions and standard motivational interviewing, and very low for CBCST versus twelve-step programme."

(four trials, n = 543), a quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.) combination (three trials, n = 510), a quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-theophylline (A methyl xanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities.) combination (one trial, n = 77), and xylocaine injections into the gastrocnemius (A large muscle in the back of the lower leg.) muscle (one trial, n = 24). The most commonly used quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) dosage was 300 mg/day (range 200 to 500 mg). We found no new trials for inclusion when searches were updated in 2014. The risk of bias in the trials varied considerably. All 23 trials claimed to be randomised, but only a minority described randomisation and allocation concealment adequately. Compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) significantly reduced cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) number over two weeks by 28%, cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) intensity by 10%, and cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) days by 20%. Cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) duration was not significantly affected. A significantly greater number of people suffered minor adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) on quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) than placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (risk difference (RD) 3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0% to 6%), mainly gastrointestinal symptoms. Overdoses of quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) have been reported elsewhere to cause potentially fatal adverse effects, but in the included trials there was no significant difference in major adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) compared with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (RD 0%, 95% CI -1% to 2%). One participant suffered from thrombocytopenia (A subnormal level of BLOOD PLATELETS.) (0.12% risk) on quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.). A quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.) combination, vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.) alone, and xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius (A large muscle in the back of the lower leg.) were not significantly different to quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) across all outcomes, including adverse effects. Based on a single trial comparison, quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) alone was significantly less effective than a quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-theophylline (A methyl xanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities.) combination but with no significant differences in adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). There is low quality evidence that quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) number and cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) days and moderate quality evidence that quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) reduces cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that with use up to 60 days, the incidence of serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) is not significantly greater than for placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) in the identified trials, but because serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) can be rarely fatal, in some countries prescription of quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) is severely restricted. Evidence from single trials suggests that theophylline (A methyl xanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities.) combined with quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) improves cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.)s more than quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) alone, and the effects of xylocaine injections into gastrocnemius (A large muscle in the back of the lower leg.) are not significantly different to quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) across all outcomes. Low or moderate quality evidence shows no significant difference between quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) and vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.) or quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) and quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.) mixture. Further research into these alternatives, as well other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.), is thus warranted. There is no evidence to judge optimal dosage or duration of quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) treatment. Further studies using different dosages and measurement of serum quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) levels will allow a therapeutic range to be defined for muscle cramp (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.) (A sustained and usually painful contraction of muscle fibers.). Because serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) are not common, large population studies are required to more accurately inform incidence. Longer lengths of follow-up in future trials will help determine the duration of action following cessation of quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.) as well as long-term adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). The search for new therapies (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.), pharmacological and nonpharmacological, should continue and further trials should compare vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.), quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-vitamin E (A generic descriptor for all TOCOPHEROLS and TOCOTRIENOLS that exhibit ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL activity.) combination, and quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.)-theophylline (A methyl xanthine derivative from tea with diuretic, smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, cardiac and central nervous system stimulant activities.) mixture with quinine (An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree.).",

We found no new studies when we searched the medical literature again and updated the review in 2014. The risk of bias in the included trials varied considerably. All 23 trials claimed to be randomised, but many failed to clearly describe how participants were assigned to treatments. There is low quality evidence that quinine (200 mg to 500 mg daily) significantly reduces cramp number and cramp days and moderate quality evidence that quinine reduces cramp intensity. There is moderate quality evidence that there are more minor adverse events with quinine compared to placebo but no increase in major adverse events. However, there are reliable reports from other sources that an overdose of quinine can cause serious harm including death. Low or moderate quality evidence shows there is no significant difference when comparing quinine to vitamin E or to a quinine-vitamin E mixture. There is evidence from one trial that theophylline combined with quinine improves cramps more than quinine alone. In a single trial there was no significant difference when comparing quinine to xylocaine injections. More research is needed to clarify the best dose and duration of treatment, as well as alternatives to quinine for cramps. The evidence is current to October 2014."

The single study comparing magnesium (A metallic element that has the atomic symbol Mg, atomic number 12, and atomic weight 24.31.) to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. The two trials comparing magnesium (A metallic element that has the atomic symbol Mg, atomic number 12, and atomic weight 24.31.) to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both.

There were no studies of people who cramp while exercising and no studies on people who cramp because of underlying medical problems. The four studies in older adults (a total of 322 participants including controls in cross-over studies) collectively suggest that magnesium is unlikely to provide a meaningful benefit in reducing the frequency or severity of cramps in that population. We consider this evidence to be of moderate quality. In contrast, the three studies in pregnant women (202 participants) are collectively inconclusive since one study found benefit in reducing both cramp frequency and cramp pain while the other two found no benefit. More research on magnesium in pregnant women is needed; however, older adult cramp sufferers appear unlikely to benefit from this therapy. While we could not determine the rate of unwanted side effects, the study withdrawal rates and adverse event discussions suggest the treatment is well tolerated."

The age range of the participants was between 10 years and 48 years. The study was evaluator-blinded, but personnel and participants could not be blinded to the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), which placed the results at a high risk of bias. Participants performed strength training (A type of strength-building exercise program that requires the body muscle to exert a force against some form of resistance, such as weight, stretch bands, water, or immovable objects.) as prescribed, but 50% of the participants did not achieve the intended aerobic exercise training regimen. The trial used change in walking distance on the six-minute walk test as a measure of function; a minimal detectable change is 24.0 m. The change from baseline to six months' follow-up in the training group (9.4 m) was not detectably different from the change in the usual care group (-0.14 m) (mean difference (MD) 9.54 m, 95% confidence interval (CI) -83.04 to 102.12; N = 12). Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity (A clinical tool to evaluate exercise capacity and to assess cardiac function under stress.), assessed by the change from baseline to six months' follow-up in peak oxygen uptake (VO2max) was similar in the training group (-0.12 mL/kg/min) and the usual care group (-1.34 mL/kg/min) (MD 1.22 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -2.16 to 4.6; N = 12). A clinically meaningful increase in VO2max is 3.5 mL/kg/min. The trial assessed function on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE), which has a range of possible scores from 0 to 66, with an increase of 3 or more points indicating clinically meaningful improvement. The HFMSE score in the training group increased by 2 points from baseline to six months' follow-up, with no change in the usual care group (MD 2.00, 95% CI -2.06 to 6.06; N = 12). The training group showed a slight improvement in muscle strength, expressed as the manual muscle testing (MMT) total score, which ranges from 28 (weakest) to 280 (strongest). The change from baseline in MMT total score was 6.8 in the training group compared to -5.14 in the usual care group (MD 11.94, 95% CI -3.44 to 27.32; N = 12). The trial stated that training had no statistically significant effects on fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) and quality of life. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low because of study limitations and imprecision. The study did not assess the effects of physical exercise training on physical activity levels. No study-related serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) or adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) leading to withdrawal occurred, but we cannot draw wider conclusions from this very low-certainty evidence. It is uncertain whether combined strength and aerobic exercise training is beneficial or harmful in people with SMA (A group of disorders marked by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord resulting in weakness and muscular atrophy, usually without evidence of injury to the corticospinal tracts.) type 3, as the quality of evidence is very low. We need well-designed and adequately powered studies using protocols that meet international standards for the development of training intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s, in order to improve our understanding of the exercise response in people with SMA (A group of disorders marked by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord resulting in weakness and muscular atrophy, usually without evidence of injury to the corticospinal tracts.) type 3 and eventually develop exercise guidelines for this condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).",

The participants were between 10 years and 48 years old and had SMA type 3 of mild-to-moderate severity. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to hide the treatment group from participants or personnel, which is an important limitation when measurements rely on participant assessments or effort. The included study was supported by the United States Department of Defense and the SMA Foundation. Participants performed strength training as prescribed, but only half of them completed the full aerobic exercise program.

Subgroup analyses revealed no clear subgroup effects for longer-term outcomes (four or more months) for assessment only versus alternative intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) controls; for university/college vs other settings; or for higher risk vs all/low risk participants.

                "We found a total of 84 randomised controlled trials (studies where participants were randomly divided into one of two or more treatment or control groups) that compared MI with either no intervention or with a different approach. Seventy of these trials focused on higher risk individuals or settings. We were mainly interested in trials with a follow-up period of 4 or more months, and the typical follow-up period was 12 months. We also evaluated the quality of the studies' designs and their applicability to our research, finding that these studies provided moderate to low quality evidence. In 66 trials, the MI consisted of a single, individual session. In 12 studies, young people attended multiple individual sessions or mixtures of both individual sessions and group sessions. Six trials used group MI sessions only. The length of MI sessions varied, but in 57 studies it was one hour or less. The shortest MI intervention was 10 to 15 minutes, and the longest had five dedicated MI sessions over a 19-hour period. Settings for the trials varied: 58 of the 84 studies took place in college (mainly university but also four vocational) settings. The remaining trials took place in healthcare locations, a youth centre, local companies, a job-related training centre, an army recruitment setting, UK drug agencies and youth prisons. The total number of young adults was 22,872, aged on average from 15 to 24 years old. The proportion of males in the trials with both males and females ranged from 22% to 90%. The ethnicity of the young adults was typically mixed, but 52 of the 67 studies that reported ethnicity involved mostly white people. At four or more months follow-up, we found only small or borderline effects showing that MI reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed, frequency of alcohol consumption, alcohol problems and peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC). We didn't find any effects for binge drinking, average BAC, drink-driving or other alcohol-related risky behaviour. We found no relationship between the length of MI and its effectiveness. Also, there were no clear subgroup differences in effects when we examined the type of comparison group (assessment only control or alternative intervention, the setting (college/university vs other settings), or risk status (higher risk students vs all/low-risk students). None of the studies reported harms related to MI. Although we found some significant effects for MI, our reading of these results is that the strength of the effects was slight and therefore unlikely to confer any advantage in practice. Overall, there is only low or moderate quality evidence for the effects found in this review. Many of the studies did not adequately describe how young people were allocated to the study groups or how they concealed the group allocation to participants and personnel. Study drop-outs were also an issue in many studies. These problems with study quality could result in inflated estimates of MI effects, so we cannot rule out the possibility that any slight effects observed in this review are overstated.

We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect. We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD, computer app or game) and technique feedback devices. Differences between intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s, populations and outcome measures limited quantitative analyses, particularly for exacerbations, adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.), unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider and absenteeism from work or school. Enhanced inhaler technique education and multi-media training improved technique in most studies immediately after the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) and at follow-up, although the variety of checklists used meant that this was difficult to assess reliably. For both adults and children, how and when inhaler technique was assessed appeared to affect whether inhaler technique improved and by how much. Analyses of the numbers of people who demonstrated correct or 'good enough' technique were generally more useful than checklist scores. Adult studies of enhanced education showed benefit when this metric was used at 2 to 26 weeks' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 13.65; 258 participants; three studies; 31 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 69 (95% CI 45 to 86) in the education group; moderate-quality evidence). A similar result was seen in studies looking at feedback devices at four weeks' follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.87 to 12.33; 97 participants; one study; 51 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 83 (95% CI 66 to 93) in the feedback group; low-quality evidence). However, the benefit of multi-media training for adults even immediately after the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) was uncertain (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 5.50; 164 participants; two studies; I\u00b2 = 49%; 30 per 100 in the control group with correct technique compared with 47 (95% CI 26 to 70) in the multi-media group; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence tended to be less clear for children, usually because results were based on fewer and smaller studies. Some studies did not report exacerbations in a way that allowed meta-analysis; others provided inconclusive results. Inhaler technique intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s provided some benefit for asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) control and quality of life but generally did not lead to consistent or important clinical benefits for adults or children. Confidence intervals included no difference or did not reach a threshold that could be considered clinically important. Responder analyses sometimes showed improvement among more people in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) groups, even though the mean difference between groups was small. We found no evidence about harms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.). Although intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s to improve inhaler technique may work in some circumstances, the variety of intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s and measurement methods used hampered our ability to perform meta-analyses and led to low to moderate confidence in our findings. Most included studies did not report important improvement in clinical outcomes. Guidelines consistently recommend that clinicians check regularly the inhaler technique of their patients; what is not clear is how clinicians can most effectively intervene if they find a patient's technique to be inadequate, and whether such intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s will have a discernible impact on clinical outcomes.",

                "We found 29 studies involving 2210 people with asthma. Studies lasted between 2 and 26 weeks. Studies reported inhaler technique on a range of different checklists. We grouped studies into three types: studies testing enhanced face-to-face training session(s), studies using multi-media to deliver inhaler training (e.g. a video, computer app or game) and studies testing devices that give people visual or audio feedback about technique. Studies tested different types of training and used different measures to gauge success, meaning that we could not bring data together. This was particularly true when we tried to assess effects on asthma attacks, adverse events, visits to a healthcare provider and absences from work or school. Both face-to-face and multi-media inhaler training improved inhaler technique in most studies, although results varied depending on how and when each technique was assessed. Some studies reported the number of people who had correct or 'good enough' technique. More people had correct or 'good enough' technique after face-to-face training and with feedback devices. But the benefit of multi-media training for adults was uncertain. Interventions that provide inhaler training may bring some benefit for quality of life and asthma control among adults and children, but results were varied and studies were small. Children may receive some benefit but results tended to be less clear for children because fewer and smaller studies have included children as participants. For studies like these, it is not possible to blind people to their assigned group. This may bias how people behave or respond to questionnaires, which reduced our confidence in the findings. We were uncertain about other results because studies did not provide enough data to show clear benefit. We cannot say for sure what is the best way to help people learn how to use their inhaler properly. It is important that patients understand how their inhaler works, so they should ask their doctor or nurse for help. We also use Cochrane Reviews to make suggestions for future research. We suggest that trials should last longer than six months and should report adherence information. The most useful information reported was the number of people who had 'good enough' inhaler technique, so we urge future trials to report this as well."

It was frequently used in the past, but its use has declined with the increasing use of other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. The purpose of this summary was to find out if penicillamine is helpful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Penicillamine was seen to be beneficial for all ranges of dosages for disease activity on tender joint pain, physician global assessment and sed rate. No major differences were observed between placebo and low dose penicillamine (<500 mg/day). For higher dosages, patients on penicillamine were twice as likely to withdraw than those receiving placebo 500 to <1000 mg/day. D-penicillamine appears be have a clinical and statistical benefit on the disease activity of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Its benefit is similar to that of other such drugs, such as disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). More adverse reactions are seen in patients being treated with D-penicillamine."

Investigators noted no significant side effects directly attributable to arginine (physiologically active in the L-form.), including hypotension or alterations in glucose homeostasis. Follow-up data from one trial revealed no statistically significant differences in adverse outcomes (cerebral palsy (A heterogeneous group of nonprogressive motor disorders caused by chronic brain injuries that originate in the prenatal period, perinatal period, or first few years of life.), cognitive delay, bilateral blindness or hearing loss requiring hearing aids (Wearable sound-amplifying devices that are intended to compensate for impaired hearing.)) at 36 months.

A multi-centre randomised controlled study that is focused on the incidence of NEC (A group of carcinomas which share a characteristic morphology, often being composed of clusters and trabecular sheets of round \"blue cells\", granular chromatin, and an attenuated rim of poorly demarcated cytoplasm.), particularly at more severe stages (2 and 3), is needed.",

Adding extra arginine to a preterm infant's feed reduced the risk of NEC in three good quality studies that included 285 infants born at less than 34 weeks' gestation. Six infants had to be treated, for one to benefit from treatment. Researchers reported no significant side effects directly attributable to too much arginine in the first 28 days, and one study reported no long-term (36 months) developmental delays. Possible effects of supplementing arginine include lower blood pressure and changes in blood glucose control. Arginine supplementation may reduce the incidence and severity of NEC in preterm infants.

Two trials compared care in-hospital led by a geriatrician versus care led by an orthopaedic surgeon. People with dementia who receive enhanced care and rehabilitation in hospital after a hip fracture may be less likely to develop delirium. When care is led by a geriatrician, they may have stays in hospital that are three to four days shorter than if care is led by an orthopaedic surgeon. There was no information on the effect of any of the care models on quality of life, and we could not be certain about their effects on other important outcomes such as an individual's ability to manage their daily activities, regaining mobility, cognitive function, pain, death rates, or the likelihood of the person returning to the same place they had been living before the fracture.

Current research does not provide supporting evidence for a reduction in access to hospital services or a reduction in hospital readmission rate for children with acute and chronic illnesses (Diseases which have one or more of the following characteristics: they are permanent, leave residual disability, are caused by nonreversible pathological alteration, require special training of the patient for rehabilitation, or may be expected to require a long period of supervision, observation, or care.) using specialist home-based nursing services; however, the only summary finding across a few studies was that there is a significant decrease in length of hospitalisation. The preliminary results show no adverse impact on physical health outcomes and a number of papers reported improved satisfaction with home-based care. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service utilisation and long-term costs.",

                "This review aimed to examine whether specialist paediatric home-based nursing services for children with acute and chronic illnesses reduce the number of hospital admissions and length of stay, enhance health care in the community and reduce stress for families at the time of their child's illness. It is an update of our original review published in 2006. We found seven relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of total of 840 children aged from birth to 18 years with acute and/or chronic illnesses receiving either specialist home-based nursing services or conventional health care. The outcomes included use of health care services, physical and mental health, satisfaction, adverse health outcomes and costs. We decided not to combine the results of these RCTs because of the variety in types of services provided, types of participants and the outcome measures used. The results of individual RCTs show improved satisfaction with home-based care with no adverse impact on physical health outcomes for children. There is some evidence that specialist home-based nursing services reduce the length of hospital stay; however, there is no evidence that it leads to a reduction in use of hospital services. Further trials are required, measuring health, satisfaction, service use and long-term costs."

            "input": "The 2016 update included two more studies (n = 196) and more publications with additional data for four already included studies. The updated review therefore includes 7524 participants from 40 randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We found data relevant to two comparisons: ICM versus standard care, and ICM versus non-ICM. The majority of studies had a high risk of selective reporting. No studies provided data for relapse or important improvement in mental state. 1. ICM versus standard care When ICM was compared with standard care for the outcome service use, ICM slightly reduced the number of days in hospital per month (n = 3595, 24 RCTs, MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.34,low-quality evidence). Similarly, for the outcome global state, ICM reduced the number of people leaving the trial early (n = 1798, 13 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79, low-quality evidence). For the outcome adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.), the evidence showed that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1456, 9 RCTs, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.51, low-quality evidence). In addition, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment due to very low-quality evidence (n = 1129, 4 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.0, very low-quality evidence). 2. ICM versus non-ICM When ICM was compared with non-ICM for the outcome service use, there was moderate-quality evidence that ICM probably makes little or no difference in the average number of days in hospital per month (n = 2220, 21 RCTs, MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.21, moderate-quality evidence) or in the average number of admissions (n = 678, 1 RCT, MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.05, moderate-quality evidence) compared to non-ICM. Similarly, the results showed that ICM may reduce the number of participants leaving the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) early (n = 1970, 7 RCTs, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95,low-quality evidence) and that ICM may make little or no difference in reducing death by suicide (n = 1152, 3 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.84, low-quality evidence). Finally, for the outcome social functioning, there was uncertainty about the effect of ICM on unemployment as compared to non-ICM (n = 73, 1 RCT, RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.74, very low-quality evidence). 3. Fidelity to ACT (Form of adoptive transfer where cells with antitumor activity are transferred to the tumor-bearing host in order to mediate tumor regression.) Within the meta-regression we found that i.) the more ICM is adherent to the ACT (Form of adoptive transfer where cells with antitumor activity are transferred to the tumor-bearing host in order to mediate tumor regression.) model, the better it is at decreasing time in hospital ('organisation fidelity' variable coefficient -0.36, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.07); and ii.) the higher the baseline hospital use in the population, the better ICM is at decreasing time in hospital ('baseline hospital use' variable coefficient -0.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.10). Combining both these variables within the model, 'organisation fidelity' is no longer significant, but the 'baseline hospital use' result still significantly influences time in hospital (regression coefficient -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07, P = 0.0027). Based on very low- to moderate-quality evidence, ICM is effective in ameliorating many outcomes relevant to people with severe mental illness (Psychiatric illness or diseases manifested by breakdowns in the adaptational process expressed primarily as abnormalities of thought, feeling, and behavior producing either distress or impairment of function.). Compared to standard care, ICM may reduce hospitalisation and increase retention in care. It also globally improved social functioning, although ICM's effect on mental state and quality of life remains unclear. Intensive Case Management is at least valuable to people with severe mental illness (Psychiatric illness or diseases manifested by breakdowns in the adaptational process expressed primarily as abnormalities of thought, feeling, and behavior producing either distress or impairment of function.)es (A state of ill health, bodily malfunction, or discomfort.) in the subgroup of those with a high level of hospitalisation (about four days per month in past two years). Intensive Case Management models with high fidelity to the original team organisation of ACT (Form of adoptive transfer where cells with antitumor activity are transferred to the tumor-bearing host in order to mediate tumor regression.) model were more effective at reducing time in hospital. However, it is unclear what overall gain ICM provides on top of a less formal non-ICM approach. We do not think that more trials comparing current ICM with standard care or non-ICM are justified, however we currently know of no review comparing non-ICM with standard care, and this should be undertaken.",

                "We carried out electronic searches for randomised controlled trials comparing ICM with non-ICM or standard care in 2009, 2012, and 2015. We included 40 trials involving 7524 people. The trials took place in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, and the USA. When ICM was compared to standard care, those in the ICM group were more likely to stay with the service, have improved general functioning, get a job, not be homeless, and have shorter stays in hospital (especially when they had had very long stays in hospital previously).\u00a0When ICM was compared to non-ICM, the only clear difference was that those in the ICM group were more likely to be kept in care. None of the evidence for the main outcomes of interest was high quality; at best the evidence was of moderate quality. In addition, the healthcare and social support systems of the countries where the studies took place were quite different, so it was difficult to make valid overall conclusions.\u00a0Furthermore, we were unable to use much of the data on quality of life and patient and carer satisfaction because the trials used many different scales to measure these outcomes, some of which were not validated.\u00a0 The development of an overall scale and its validation would be very beneficial in producing services that people favour.

Overall, 16 trials (464 participants) provided data for meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants). All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training. Box model training versus no training: The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22). Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88). Three trials reported movement distance but could not be meta-analysed as they were not in a format for meta-analysis. There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials. None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction. Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65). There was no significant difference in the time taken to complete the task in the remaining three comparisons (reverse alignment versus forward alignment box training; box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; and single incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.).) versus multiport box model training). There were no significant differences in the error score between the two groups in any of the comparisons (box trainer suturing versus box trainer drills; single incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.).) versus multiport box model training; Z-maze box training versus U-maze box training). The only trial that reported accuracy score found significantly higher accuracy score with Z-maze box training than U-maze box training (1 trial; 16 participants; SMD 1.55; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.71). One trial (36 participants) found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer (SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56). Another trial (22 participants) found significantly higher composite score with reverse alignment compared with forward alignment box training (SMD 1.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 2.84). There were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons. None of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials. The results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance). Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic (inserted through a small incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.).) near the navel to examine the abdominal and pelvic organs in the PERITONEAL CAVITY.) experience. The impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown. There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training. Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary. Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.",

The primary outcomes investigated in this review were time taken to perform task, error score, accuracy score, and a composite (total summed) performance score. Box model training appears to decrease the time required to perform a laparoscopic task, improve the accuracy, decrease the errors, and improves the overall performance. This suggests that the box model training improves technical skills of surgical trainees with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery. There does not appear to be any significant differences in different methods of box model training. The impact of the improved surgical skills on patients or healthcare funders in terms of improved health or decreased costs is unknown. All but one of the trials were of high risk of bias (defects in study design that can lead to arriving at incorrect conclusions with overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).

Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence).

A median of nine BCT (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.)s (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.) were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.), and is a way to report whether individual BCT (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.)s (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.) are linked to the effect of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.).

Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. The BCT (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.)s (A test tube, capillary tube, or other tube designed for the collection of blood.) of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context. Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s made no reference to any theories.

This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in both groups were compared to each other at these time points. Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding. We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice. Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine (250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after the advice. There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking. No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions. Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce drinking compared to face-to-face conversation. Evidence was moderate-to-low quality."

(RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.) (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.). However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effect (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.)s was higher with benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) than with placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.) showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.) when treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ed with benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) over placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) in the short-term treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment of panic disorders (A type of anxiety disorder characterized by unexpected panic attacks that last minutes or, rarely, hours.). The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) versus placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) and placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.), but between benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.) and other agents (Drugs used for their effects on the kidneys' regulation of body fluid composition and volume.), notably SSRIs (used to treat depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.).), both in terms of efficacy and adverse effect (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.)s. The choice of treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.) from treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment in a long-term perspective.",

                "We found consistent evidence for a possible advantage of benzodiazepines in the improvement of panic symptoms and in the number of participants dropping out of treatment. Furthermore, benzodiazepines may improve social functioning more than placebo. However, there may be more dropouts due to side effects and more participants who experience at least one side effect when treated with benzodiazepines. We found several severe limitations in the design of the included studies. For example, it seems that at least in some studies participants and physicians were able to guess to which treatment arm the participants were allocated, thus it is possible that some trials were not really blinded. These limitations may have led to an overestimation of the treatment effect. Another major limitation is that our included studies were only short-term studies and did not reflect the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, it is unclear if the effect is maintained after the end of treatment. High-quality long-term studies should be carried out to establish whether the benefits of treatment can be maintained and to put the benefits in context of withdrawal effects and the risk of dependency. However, it is unlikely that the general conclusions regarding the short-term efficacy and the dependency potential of benzodiazepines will change. Comparisons with other active treatment including psychotherapy, for example in multiple-treatment meta-analyses, may thus be more suitable to inform clinical practise."

No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality or non-fatal events as most studies were short term (all studies had follow-up of one year or less). There was also considerable heterogeneity between studies, which meant that it was not possible to combine studies statistically for cardiovascular risk (I2 statistic for systolic blood pressure (SBP (Carrier proteins produced in the Sertoli cells of the testis, secreted into the seminiferous tubules, and transported via the efferent ducts to the epididymis.)) was 96%, for diastolic blood pressure (DBP (encoded by the human HSD17B4 gene.)) 96%, for total cholesterol (The determination of the amount of total cholesterol present in a sample.) 96%, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 95%, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) 98%, triglyceride (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.)s (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.) 75%). Nine trials measured blood pressure, six individual trials found reductions in SBP (Carrier proteins produced in the Sertoli cells of the testis, secreted into the seminiferous tubules, and transported via the efferent ducts to the epididymis.) (reductions ranged from -22.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -17.7) to -11.5 mmHg (95% CI -21.5 to -1.46)), two trials found no clear evidence of a difference (however, CIs (A lesion with cytological characteristics associated with invasive carcinoma but the tumor cells are confined to the epithelium of origin, without invasion of the basement membrane.) were wide and an increase or decrease in SBP (Carrier proteins produced in the Sertoli cells of the testis, secreted into the seminiferous tubules, and transported via the efferent ducts to the epididymis.) cannot be ruled out), and one trial found an increase in SBP (Carrier proteins produced in the Sertoli cells of the testis, secreted into the seminiferous tubules, and transported via the efferent ducts to the epididymis.) with tai chi (increase 5.2 mmHg, 95% CI 3.73 to 6.67). A similar pattern was seen for DBP (encoded by the human HSD17B4 gene.): three trials found a reduction in DBP (encoded by the human HSD17B4 gene.) (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs (A lesion with cytological characteristics associated with invasive carcinoma but the tumor cells are confined to the epithelium of origin, without invasion of the basement membrane.).

We found 13 trials, none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of tai chi on reducing cardiovascular deaths or non-fatal endpoints. There were variations in the duration and style of tai chi and the follow-up of the interventions ranged from three to 12 months. Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies. None of the included studies reported on adverse events. Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.

The intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s were very heterogeneous in the components of the family intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), the other risk behaviours targeted alongside tobacco (Substances and products derived from NICOTIANA TABACUM.), the age of children at baseline and the length of follow-up. Two intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s were tested by two RCTs, one was tested by three RCTs and the remaining 20 distinct intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s were tested only by one RCT. Twenty-three intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s were tested in the USA, two in Europe, one in Australia and one in India. The control conditions fell into two main groups: no intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) or usual care; or school-based intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s provided to all participants. These two groups of studies were considered separately. Most studies had a judgement of 'unclear' for at least one risk of bias criteria, so the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. Although there was heterogeneity between studies there was little evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the results. We were unable to extract data from all studies in a format that allowed inclusion in a meta-analysis. There was moderate quality evidence family-based intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s had a positive impact on preventing (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) smoking when compared to a no intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) control (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). Nine studies (4810 participants) reporting smoking uptake amongst baseline non-smokers could be pooled, but eight studies with about 5000 participants could not be pooled because of insufficient data. The pooled estimate detected a significant reduction in smoking behaviour in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) arms (risk ratio [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68 to 0.84). Most of these studies used intensive intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. Estimates for the medium and low intensity subgroups were similar but confidence intervals were wide. Two studies in which some of the 4487 participants already had smoking experience at baseline did not detect evidence of effect (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.17). Eight RCTs compared a combined family plus school intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) to a school intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) only. Of the three studies with data, two RCTS with outcomes for 2301 baseline never smokers detected evidence of an effect (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) and one study with data for 1096 participants not restricted to never users at baseline also detected a benefit (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94). The other five studies with about 18,500 participants did not report data in a format allowing meta-analysis. One RCT also compared a family intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) to a school 'good behaviour' intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) and did not detect a difference between the two types of programme (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.38, n = 388). No studies identified any adverse effects of intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). There is moderate quality evidence to suggest that family-based intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s can have a positive effect on preventing (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) children and adolescents from starting to smoke. There were more studies of high intensity programmes compared to a control group receiving no intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), than there were for other compairsons. The evidence is therefore strongest for high intensity programmes used independently of school intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. Programmes typically addressed family functioning, and were introduced when children were between 11 and 14 years old. Based on this moderate quality evidence a family intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) might reduce uptake or experimentation with smoking by between 16 and 32%. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously because effect estimates could not include data from all studies. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective high intensity intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting.",

                "We identified 27 trials; 23 in the USA and one each in Australia, India, the Netherlands, and Norway. The focus varied amongst the studies. Fifteen trials focused on substance use prevention: six focused only on tobacco prevention; one focused on alcohol; one on general substance abuse; three on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana; two on alcohol and tobacco; and two on tobacco and cardiovascular health. Two trials focused on HIV and unsafe sex prevention. Ten trials focused on family functioning, child development and modifying adolescent behaviour. Duration of follow-up after the intervention was very varied, ranging from 6 months to over 15 years for the studies which intervened with mothers of very young children. Nine trials provided data to compare a family tobacco intervention to no intervention on future smoking behaviour for those who did not smoke at the start of the study. We could not include data from a further eight trials. The results showed a significant benefit of family-based interventions over the control comparison on preventing experimentation with or taking up regular smoking. Our estimate suggested that family interventions could reduce the number of adolescents who tried smoking at all by between 16 and 32%. Two trials provided data to compare a combined family plus school intervention to a school intervention and also favoured the family-based intervention. The estimate suggested that the addition of a family intervention might reduce the onset of smoking by between 4 and 25%. We could not include data from a further five trials. Our interpretation is that the common feature of the effective interventions was encouraging authoritative parenting (which is usually defined as showing strong interest in and care for the adolescent, often with rule setting). This is different from authoritarian parenting (do as I say) or neglectful or unsupervised parenting. Because most of the randomised controlled trials included in the review did not report their methods in sufficient detail to be confident that the results were not biased, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate, which means that the estimate of effect is uncertain. There is moderate quality evidence that family-based interventions can prevent children and adolescents from starting to smoke. Intensive programs may be more likely to be successful than those of lower intensity. There is also evidence to suggest that adding a family-based component to a school intervention may be effective. As the interventions and settings in the review differed considerably, it is important that family-based programmes continue to be evaluated."

The effect of antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) prophylaxis on growth in children with cystic fibrosis (An autosomal recessive genetic disease of the EXOCRINE GLANDS.) was inconsistent across the studies. There was an increased risk of emergence of pathogenic strains with either azithromycin (A semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic structurally related to ERYTHROMYCIN.) or ciprofloxacin (A broad-spectrum antimicrobial carboxyfluoroquinoline.) prophylaxis in two studies reporting this outcome. There was no significant difference in the quality of life (one study). In three studies, there was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) with prophylaxis with azithromycin (A semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic structurally related to ERYTHROMYCIN.) (two studies) or ciprofloxacin (A broad-spectrum antimicrobial carboxyfluoroquinoline.) (one study). There was no evidence of increased antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) resistance in two studies. In the one study of children with sickle cell disease (A disease characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, episodic painful crises, and pathologic involvement of many organs.), a significantly lesser proportion of children with pneumococcal septicaemia was reported with penicillin V (A broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic used orally in the treatment of mild to moderate infections by susceptible gram-positive organisms.) prophylaxis (P value = 0.0025). In the one study of children with cancer (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) there was a significant decrease in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (Infection of the lung often accompanied by inflammation.) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (A drug combination with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.) (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.47, P value < 0.01). There was no significant increase in the frequency of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) with antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) prophylaxis. In low birth weight children with underlying respiratory disorders (Diseases of the respiratory system in general or unspecified or for a specific respiratory disease not available.), there was no significant difference in the proportion of children with pulmonary infection (An acute or chronic infectious process affecting the lungs.) with vancomycin (Antibacterial obtained from Streptomyces orientalis.) prophylaxis (P value = 0.18). No included studies reported time off school or carer time off work. There is inconclusive evidence that antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) prophylaxis in certain groups of high-risk children can reduce pneumonia (Infection of the lung often accompanied by inflammation.), exacerbations, hospital admission and mortality in certain conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.). However, limitations in the evidence base mean more clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)s for prevent (brand of veterinary medicine)ing LRTIs in children at high risk should be conducted. Specifically, clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)s for prevent (brand of veterinary medicine)ing LRTIs in congenital heart disease, metabolic disease (Generic term for diseases caused by an abnormal metabolic process.), endocrine and renal disorders (Pathological processes of the KIDNEY or its component tissues.), neurological disease (Diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system.) or prematurity should be a priority.",

                "In February 2015, we searched for studies examining the effect of antibiotics to prevent LRTI in children aged 12 years and under with an increased risk of contracting such infections. We included 10 studies; three examined the effectiveness of antibiotics in 1345 children with HIV, four in 429 children with cystic fibrosis, one in 219 children with sickle cell disease, one in 160 children undergoing treatment for cancer, and one in 40 children who were underweight at birth with underlying breathing problems. The study duration was between 18.9 and 24.7 months for children with HIV, between six and 36 months in children with cystic fibrosis, 15 months in one study of children with sickle cell disease, 13 to 24 months in one study of children with cancer, and seven days in low birth weight newborns with underlying respiratory problems. Of three studies that included children with HIV, one was funded by an International Aid Agency, another by government and the third by a charity. Of four studies that included children with cystic fibrosis, three were funded by charities and one by government. The one study that included children with sickle cell disease was funded by government and the study that included children with cancer was funded by government, industry and charity. The funding source for the study that included newborns with underlying respiratory disorders was not specified. In children with HIV, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of contracting tuberculosis. Overall there was no improvement in death rates, but there was a marked reduction in hospital admission with antibiotic use in one study. In children with cystic fibrosis, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of infection with Pseudomonas bacteria, but there was a reduction in flare-ups, where bacterial infection makes it harder for the child to breathe. In one study of children with sickle cell disease, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting blood infections. In one study of children with cancers, antibiotics reduced the likelihood of contracting Pneumocystis infection in the lungs. In low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders, antibiotics did not reduce the likelihood of lung infections. In children with HIV, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics for preventing tuberculosis as moderate because of differences in how the antibiotics were administered. We rated the quality of the evidence for antibiotic use in reducing deaths as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for hospital admissions. In children with cystic fibrosis, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for two studies that examined the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pseudomonas infection as moderate because of differences in the types of antibiotics used. We rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing 'flare-ups' as high. In children with cancer, we rated the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of Pneumocystis infection as moderate because of the likelihood of indirectness of the study results. Due to lack of data, we could not rate the quality of the evidence for the effect of antibiotics in reducing the likelihood of blood infections in children with sickle cell disease, or in reducing the likelihood of lung infections in low birth weight newborns with respiratory disorders; the two studies had low probability and high probability of bias respectively."

Studies were conducted in the USA, Australia, China, Finland, and Netherlands. The age of the participants in the trials ranged from 19 to 62 years. We are uncertain as to whether there are differences in the number of people with heart or lung complications or surgical complications between nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. We are uncertain as to whether there are any differences in heart or lung complications, surgical complications, or pain scores between helium and carbon dioxide. There were no serious side effects related to the use of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, or room air, but generally serious side effects are rare events and it would take larger studies with many more participants to be sure that these gases are equally safe. There were three serious side effects when helium was used. Room air seemed to be associated with lower total hospital costs compared with carbon dioxide for insufflation of the abdominal cavity. Because of the few participants included in the review, the safety of using nitrous oxide, helium, or room air is unknown. There is no evidence for any clinical improvement by using nitrous oxide, helium, or room air instead of carbon dioxide. Overall, the quality of the evidence for the results is very low. Thus, future well-designed trials examining complications, harms, quality of life, and pain are urgently needed."

Little evidence of benefit was found when corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) or intravenous immunoglobulins were used to reduce the risk of heart valve lesions (Flaps of tissue that prevent regurgitation of BLOOD from the HEART VENTRICLES to the HEART ATRIA or from the PULMONARY ARTERIES or AORTA to the ventricles.) in patients with acute rheumatic fever (A febrile disease occurring as a delayed sequela of infections with STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES.).

In addition, risk of bias was substantial, so results should be viewed with caution. New randomised controlled trials in patients with acute rheumatic fever (A febrile disease occurring as a delayed sequela of infections with STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES.) are warranted to assess the effects of corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) such as oral prednisone (A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from CORTISONE.) (A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from CORTISONE.) and intravenous methylprednisolone (A PREDNISOLONE derivative with similar anti-inflammatory action.) and the effects of other new anti-inflammatory agents (Substances that reduce or suppress INFLAMMATION.).

For this latest update, the search was rerun on 17 October 2013, and no new studies were found. Rheumatic fever is a late complication of a type of throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria. It is an immune system disease that can lead to inflammatory disease of the heart (carditis), joints, brain and skin. Carditis can cause heart failure and death. Various anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to treat carditis, including corticosteroids, aspirin and immunoglobulins (immune therapy using antibodies). No new trials were identified in this update. This review includes eight trials with 996 participants. Evidence shows little effect of corticosteroids over aspirin in preventing cardiac disease after one year (six studies, 907 participants, risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.15). Several steroidal agents such as corticotrophin, cortisone, hydrocortisone and dexamethasone were compared with aspirin before 1966, and prednisone and immunoglobulins were compared with placebo in studies from 1990 and 2001, respectively. Most studies did not report on adverse events, but those that did reported complications due to corticosteroids including weight gain, enlarged facial features and acne. Trials were generally old (six of the eight trials were conducted between 1955 and 1965), small and of poor quality and had high risk of bias. For this reason, results should be interpreted with caution."

There is some evidence from two trials that insecticides are effective in reducing trachoma (A chronic infection of the CONJUNCTIVA and CORNEA caused by CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS.), however, this effect was not demonstrated in another trial that used insecticides.

                "This review aimed to find out whether CBT is effective for CBT, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with other treatments, and whether it is more effective than other treatments used for CFS. The review included 15 studies, with a total of 1043 CFS participants. The review showed that people attending for CBT were more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than people who received usual care or were on a waiting list for therapy, with 40% of people in the CBT group showing clinical improvement, in contrast with 26% in usual care. At follow-up, 1-7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. Physical functioning, depression, anxiety and psychological distress symptoms were also more reduced when compared with other psychological therapies. However at follow-up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Very few studies reported on the acceptability of CBT and no studies examined side effects. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches."

(HbSS, HbSC (similar to, but less severe than sickle cell anemia.), HbS\u03b2+thal and HbS\u03b20thal) was eligible for inclusion in this review. Of the 46 enrolled participants, seven withdrew before randomisation leaving 39 participants who were randomised. Only 25 participants completed the full six months of follow up. Participants were randomised to receive oral vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.)3 (Derivative of 7-dehydroxycholesterol formed by ULTRAVIOLET RAYS breaking of the C9-C10 bond.)

Two participants from the treatment group have missing values of baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (The major circulating metabolite of VITAMIN D3.) (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.), therefore the number of samples analysed was 37 (vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) n = 18, placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) n = 19). The included study had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data (high dropout rate in the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group), but a low risk of bias for other domains such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors, selective outcome reporting; and an unclear risk of other biases. Compared to the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group, the vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) group had significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (The major circulating metabolite of VITAMIN D3.)

( (The major circulating metabolite of VITAMIN D3.)25(OH)D) levels at eight weeks, mean difference 29.79 (95% confidence interval 26.63 to 32.95); at 16 weeks, mean difference 12.67 (95% confidence interval 10.43 to 14.90); and at 24 weeks, mean difference 15.52 (95% confidence interval 13.50 to 17.54). We determined the quality of the evidence for this outcome to be moderate. There was no significant difference of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (tingling of lips or hands (The distal part of the arm beyond the wrist in humans and primates, that includes the palm, fingers, and thumb.)) between the vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) and placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) groups, risk ratio 3.16 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 72.84), but the quality of the evidence was low. Regarding the frequency of pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), the vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) group had significantly fewer pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) days compared to the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group, mean difference -10.00 (95% confidence interval -16.47 to -3.53), but again the quality of the evidence was low. Furthermore, the review included physical functioning PedsQL scores which was reported as absolute change from baseline. The vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) group had a lower (worse) health-related quality of life score than the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group but this was not significant at eight weeks, mean difference -2.02 (95% confidence interval -6.34 to 2.30). However, the difference was significant at both 16 weeks, mean difference -12.56 (95% confidence interval -16.44 to -8.69) and 24 weeks, mean difference -12.59 (95% confidence interval -17.43 to -7.76). We determined the quality of evidence for this outcome to be low. We included only one low-quality clinical study which had a high risk of bias with regards to incomplete outcome data. Therefore, we consider that the evidence is not of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider the relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) supplementation (Adding nutrients to the diet.)

                "The review included one study which recruited 46 people with sickle cell disease aged between seven and 21 years; of these 39 people in the study were randomly selected to take vitamin D tablets or placebo tablets for six weeks and then followed up for six months. The study reported results from 37 people. People taking a vitamin D supplement had higher levels of vitamin D in their blood when it was measured after eight, 16 and 24 weeks. There were no differences in the number of people reporting side effects, such as tingling in the lips or hands between the vitamin D group and the placebo group. The vitamin D group had fewer days of pain compared to the placebo group. The study also reported on health-related quality of life (physical functioning scores). After eight weeks the vitamin D group had a slightly worse score than the placebo group, but the difference was much greater after 16 and 24 weeks. Given these results from this small single study with moderate to low quality of the evidence, we do not think the results of our review are of sufficient quality to guide clinical practice. Until further evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider relevant existing guidelines for vitamin D supplementation (e.g. the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines), and recommendations for calcium and vitamin D intake (from e.g. the USA Institute of Medicine). High-quality studies looking at the effects of supplementing vitamin D in children and adults with sickle cell disease are needed. We do not think there are risks of bias in the way people were put into the different groups and we do not think anyone (either the participant or the doctor) could guess which group they were in once the study started. Even though the adverse events were not reported in the original report, the study author provided the information upon request. More people dropped out of the placebo group (68.4%) than the vitamin D group (5%), and two people assigned to vitamin D group but not included in the analysis. We considered there was a high risk of bias in the way the study reported results. The evidence is only applicable to people with sickle cell disease when they are in a steady state, i.e. at least 30 days from blood transfusion and at least 14 days from any acute sickle complication. The quality of evidence for the outcomes ranged from moderate to low. We considered the quality of the evidence for vitamin D blood levels to be moderate, and for adverse events, days of pain and health-related quality of life, the quality of the evidence was low."

Children were allocated randomly to one of the two treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.). Treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia. Speech pathology students delivered the treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) in the English language.

ReST (MD = 18.3) demonstrated a marginally greater effect than NDP-3 (MD = 18.2) for accuracy of production on non-treated words (A cognitive disorder marked by an impaired ability to comprehend or express language in its written or spoken form.) at one month post-treatment (A constellation of symptoms lasting months to years reported by some Lyme disease patients who had undergone previous antibiotic therapy.) (absolute MD = 0.1 between groups). The study did not assess the outcome of functional communication. There is limited evidence that, when delivered intensively, both NDP-3 and ReST may effect improvement in word accuracy in 4- to 12-year-old children with CAS, measured by the accuracy of production on treated and non-treated words (A cognitive disorder marked by an impaired ability to comprehend or express language in its written or spoken form.), speech production (Measurement of parameters of the speech product such as vocal tone, loudness, pitch, voice quality, articulation, resonance, phonation, phonetic structure and prosody.) consistency and the accuracy of connected speech. The study did not measure functional communication. No formal analyses were conducted to compare NDP-3 and ReST by the original study authors, hence one treatment cannot be reliably advocated over the other. We are also unable to say whether either treatment is better than no treatment or treatment as usual. No evidence currently exists to support the effectiveness of other treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for children aged 4 to 12 years with idiopathic CAS without other comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders (A childhood disorder that has a neurological basis and manifests as a developmental disability.).

Only one of the four studies compared the effect of antibiotic treatment for 12 months with placebo on visual acuity and found similar changes in both groups. Three studies examined the effect of antibiotics on reducing the number of recurring episodes of the disease. Two of these three studies were conducted in Brazil in adults infected with the more aggressive South American strains of the parasite, which can cause frequently recurring eye symptoms. The studies from Brazil found that the long-term antibiotics over 14 and 12 months, respectively, reduced the number of recurrent episodes of retinochoroiditis. The other study did not find that short-term (eight weeks) treatment with antibiotics made any difference. Two studies reported an improvement in intraocular inflammation in antibiotic-treated compared with untreated participants, and one study reported no changes. Two studies investigated side effects of giving antibiotics such as decreased white blood cells, loss of appetite, rashes and other allergic reactions and found only weak evidence that antibiotics increase the risk of side effects. There were problems with the design, conduct, and analyses of all of the studies, which could have biased the results. There was a lack of evidence about whether antibiotics (short or long term) prevent vision loss. More trials are needed, including trials of newer antibiotics."

Five trials, involving 623 participants, tested the intramedullary hip screw (IMHS). Three trials, involving 394 participants, tested the proximal femoral nail. Other trials involved newer varieties of intramedullary nails. Most older trials showed a tendency for the nails to be associated with an increased risk of fracture of the thigh bone both during and after the operation. More recent trials testing newer varieties of nails seemed to avoid this specific problem to some extent. The review found that using intramedullary nails resulted in one extra reoperation in every 50 people. Mortality and, where data were available, other long-term outcomes were similar between the implants. The review concluded that current evidence supports the continued use of the sliding hip screw for fixing the more common types of extracapsular hip fractures. This may not be the case for some of the more recently developed designs of intramedullary nails or for specific fracture types, but further research is required to confirm this."

There was some evidence from three small studies that showed surgical treatment (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) was preferable to nonsurgical management in reducing pneumonia (Infection of the lung often accompanied by inflammation.), chest deformity, tracheostomy (Surgical formation of an opening into the trachea through the neck, or the opening so created.), duration of mechanical ventilation (A method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients by use of a powered device that forces oxygenated air into the lungs.), and length of ICU stay. Further well-designed studies with a sufficient sample size are required to confirm these results and to detect possible surgical effects on mortality.",

We included three studies in this review, which involved 123 people. In these studies, people with flail chest were randomly allocated into the surgery or no surgery study groups. The results show that surgery to repair the broken ribs reduces pneumonia, chest deformity, tracheostomy, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. There was no difference in deaths between people treated with surgery or no surgery. Since only six people died across the three studies, due to a variety of causes, more research is needed in order to know for certain which treatment is better for reducing deaths. These three small studies have shown that surgical treatment is preferable to nonsurgical treatment in reducing pneumonia, chest deformity, tracheostomy, mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the ICU. More research is needed in order to know which treatment is better for reducing deaths. Three more studies are being undertaken by researchers in the USA and Canada at the moment, and the results will be incorporated into the review in the future."

The participants were of any age with and without cardiovascular disease (Pathological conditions involving the CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM including the HEART; the BLOOD VESSELS; or the PERICARDIUM.) and the trials studied cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) effects within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks. Cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) 0.025 mg/day to 0.8 mg/day caused LDL cholesterol (contained in or bound to low density lipoproteins (LDL), including CHOLESTEROL ESTERS and free cholesterol.) decreases of 11.0% to 40.8%, total cholesterol (The determination of the amount of total cholesterol present in a sample.) decreases of 8.0% to 28.8% and triglyceride (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.) decreases of 9.0% to 21.4%. We judged the certainty of evidence for these effects to be high. Log dose-response data over doses of 2.5 mg to 80 mg revealed strong linear dose-related effects on LDL cholesterol (contained in or bound to low density lipoproteins (LDL), including CHOLESTEROL ESTERS and free cholesterol.), total cholesterol (The determination of the amount of total cholesterol present in a sample.) and triglyceride (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.)s.

There was no dose-related effect of cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) on HDL cholesterol (contained in or bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), including CHOLESTEROL ESTERS and free cholesterol.), but overall cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) increased HDL cholesterol (contained in or bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), including CHOLESTEROL ESTERS and free cholesterol.) by 5%. There was a high risk of bias for the outcome withdrawals due to adverse effects, but a low risk of bias for the lipid measurements (A quantitative measurement of the amount of lipids (cholesterol, lipoproteins, and triglycerides (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.)) present in a sample.). Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not different between cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) and placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) in 11 of 19 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.74). The LDL cholesterol (contained in or bound to low density lipoproteins (LDL), including CHOLESTEROL ESTERS and free cholesterol.), total cholesterol (The determination of the amount of total cholesterol present in a sample.), and triglyceride (Fats composed of three fatty acid chains linked to a glycerol molecule.) lowering effect of cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) was linearly dependent on dose. Cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with fluvastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic properties.), atorvastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) and rosuvastatin (A statin with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic activities.), cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) was about 250-fold more potent than fluvastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic properties.), 20-fold more potent than atorvastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) and 5.5-fold more potent than rosuvastatin (A statin with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic activities.) in reducing LDL cholesterol (contained in or bound to low density lipoproteins (LDL), including CHOLESTEROL ESTERS and free cholesterol.), and 233-fold greater potency than fluvastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic properties.), 18-fold greater potency than atorvastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) and six-fold greater potency than rosuvastatin (A statin with antilipidemic and potential antineoplastic activities.) at reducing total cholesterol (The determination of the amount of total cholesterol present in a sample.). This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.) associated with cerivastatin (A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.) because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 42% of the RCTs.",

For consistency regarding the direction of effects, continuous outcomes with negative values, and dichotomous outcomes with values less than one favour remote ischaemic preconditioning. Based on high quality evidence, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the reduction of serum creatinine (A quantitative measurement of the amount of creatinine present in a sample of serum.) levels at postoperative days one (14 studies, 1022 participants: MD -0.02 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02; I2 = 21%), two (9 studies, 770 participants: MD -0.04 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 31%), and three (6 studies, 417 participants: MD -0.05 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10; I2 = 68%) compared to control. Serious adverse events occurred in four patients receiving remote ischaemic preconditioning by iliac clamping. It is uncertain whether remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation leads to increased adverse effects compared to control because the certainty of the evidence is low (15 studies, 3993 participants: RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.55 to 21.76; I2 = 0%); only two of 15 studies reported any adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group), the remaining 13 studies stated no adverse effects were observed in either group. Compared to control, remote ischaemic preconditioning made little or no difference to the need for dialysis (13 studies, 2417 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; I2 = 60%; moderate quality evidence), length of hospital stay (8 studies, 920 participants: MD 0.17 days, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.80; I2 = 49%, high quality evidence), or all-cause mortality (24 studies, 4931 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.37; I2 = 0%, high quality evidence). Remote ischaemic preconditioning may have slightly improved the incidence of acute kidney injury (Sudden and sustained deterioration of the kidney function characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate, increased serum creatinine or oliguria.) using either the AKIN (8 studies, 2364 participants: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; I2 = 61%, high quality evidence) or RIFLE criteria (3 studies, 1586 participants: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence). Remote ischaemic preconditioning by cuff inflation appears to be a safe method, and probably leads to little or no difference in serum creatinine (A quantitative measurement of the amount of creatinine present in a sample of serum.), adverse effects, need for dialysis, length of hospital stay, death and in the incidence of acute kidney injury (Sudden and sustained deterioration of the kidney function characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate, increased serum creatinine or oliguria.). Overall we had moderate-high certainty evidence however the available data does not confirm the efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning in reducing renal ischaemia reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major cardiac (The hollow, muscular organ that maintains the circulation of the blood.) and vascular surgery (Operative procedures for the treatment of vascular disorders.) in which renal ischaemia reperfusion injury may occur.",

The overall quality of the studies was acceptable. Twenty studies were funded without economical interest. One study was funded from a source with commercial interest.

Remote ischaemic preconditioning performed with a blood pressure cuff appears to be safe as only two of 15 studies reported adverse effects (6/1999 in the remote ischaemic preconditioning group and 1/1994 in the control group). However remote ischaemic preconditioning by vascular clamping may cause vascular complications. Kidney injury in patients undergoing (surgical) procedures in which kidney injury may occur, was not reduced by remote Ischaemic preconditioning measured at day one, two or three after surgery. The need for dialysis, hospital stay and death were not reduced by remote ischaemic preconditioning.

Also, according to moderate quality evidence, giving IVIg (Immunoglobulin preparations used in intravenous infusion, containing primarily IMMUNOGLOBULIN G.

In children, according to low quality evidence, IVIg (Immunoglobulin preparations used in intravenous infusion, containing primarily IMMUNOGLOBULIN G.

                "We included trials of IVIg compared to no treatment, dummy treatment, PE, immunoabsorption (in which specific antibodies are removed from blood) or other immune treatments. We also considered trials of IVIg added to another treatment. We found 12 trials. Some of these compared more than two treatments. - Seven trials compared IVIg with PE (in 623 participants with severe GBS). - One compared PE alone to PE followed by IVIg (in 249 participants). - Three compared IVIg with supportive care (in a total of 75 children). - One compared a two-day to a five-day IVIg treatment plan (in 51 children). - One compared IVIg with immunoabsorption (in 48 participants). - One compared IVIg plus immunoabsorption with immunoabsorption (in 34 participants). For this review, we chose change in a disability scale after four weeks\u2019 treatment as the main measure of the effect of IVIg. Five of the trials comparing IVIg and PE measured change in disability. IVIg and PE produced a similar amount of improvement in disability in the 536 trial participants. This evidence was of moderate quality. Harmful effects were no more frequent with PE or IVIg, but people were more likely to finish a course of IVIg. In one trial involving 249 participants who received PE or PE followed by IVIg, there was slightly more improvement from PE and IVIg together. The effect was probably not large enough to be noticeable but the results do not rule out the possibility. This evidence was of moderate quality. Three studies in children suggested that IVIg speeds up recovery compared with supportive care. Only one used the disability scale. They provided low quality evidence. In one small trial in children, the effect on disability appeared similar with a standard dose over two days rather than five days. Giving IVIg after immunoabsorption provided no extra benefit over immunoabsorption alone. No conclusions can be drawn from the trial comparing IVIg with immunoabsorption. The risk of bias in the included studies was variable. More research is needed to find the best dose of IVIg in adults and children, and one trial of giving a second dose to people who otherwise would be expected to do badly is in progress. The evidence is current to December 2013."

In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.), a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A test to evaluate amount of oxygen taken up by arterial blood and expressed as a fraction of total oxygen of inspired air.) was associated with a decrease in surgical site infection (Infection occurring at the site of a surgical incision.)s (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A test to evaluate amount of oxygen taken up by arterial blood and expressed as a fraction of total oxygen of inspired air.) on surgical site infection (Infection occurring at the site of a surgical incision.)s in any other subgroup analyses. As the risk of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.), including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen (A test to evaluate amount of oxygen taken up by arterial blood and expressed as a fraction of total oxygen of inspired air.) of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen (A test to evaluate amount of oxygen taken up by arterial blood and expressed as a fraction of total oxygen of inspired air.) of 60% or higher on surgical site infection (Infection occurring at the site of a surgical incision.), our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (A test to evaluate amount of oxygen taken up by arterial blood and expressed as a fraction of total oxygen of inspired air.) during anaesthesia (A state characterized by loss of feeling or sensation.) and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long-term follow-up, are warranted.",

Two studies did not report on any of the outcomes of interest, leaving 23 studies (3258 children). Overall, we assessed most studies as being at low to moderate risk of bias. In the 23 studies many different antibiotics were used and the children were of different ages and had suffered from glue ear for various lengths of time. They looked at the benefits at various time points after the treatment was given. The most important outcomes that we measured were the difference in the proportion of children who no longer had glue ear two to three months after the treatment was started and adverse effects of antibiotics (diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash). We found moderate quality evidence (six trials including 484 children) that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to have glue ear resolved two to three months after the treatment was started than those allocated to control treatment. The number of children needed to treat for one beneficial outcome (NNTB) was five. However, there is evidence (albeit of low quality; five trials, 742 children) indicating that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting or skin rash than those allocated to control treatment. The number of children needed to treat for one harmful outcome (NNTH) was 20. In respect of the secondary outcome of having glue ear resolved at any time point, we found low to moderate quality evidence from five of our analyses where we combined data from studies (meta-analyses), which included between two and 14 studies, of a beneficial effect of antibiotics, with a NNTB ranging from three to seven. Time periods ranged from 10 to 14 days to six months. In terms of other secondary outcomes, only two trials (849 children) reported on hearing levels at two to four weeks and found conflicting results. None of the trials reported data on speech, language and cognitive development or quality of life. Low quality evidence did not show that oral antibiotics were associated with fewer ventilation tube (grommet) insertions (two trials, 121 children) or in adverse consequences for the tympanic membrane (ear drum) (one trial, 103 children). Low quality evidence indicated that children treated with oral antibiotics were less likely to have acute otitis media (ear infection) episodes within four to eight weeks (five trials, 1086 children; NNTB 18) and within six months after treatment was started (two trials, 199 children; NNTB 5). It should however be noted that the beneficial effect of oral antibiotics on ear infection episodes within four to eight weeks was no longer significant when studies with high risk of bias were excluded. Moderate quality evidence is available that children with glue ear do benefit from oral antibiotics in terms of resolving glue ear at various time points and reducing acute otitis media episodes during follow-up compared with control treatment. Low quality evidence is available that children treated with oral antibiotics are more likely to experience diarrhoea, vomiting and skin rash than those receiving the control treatment. Currently only two trials have assessed the impact of oral antibiotics on hearing and these showed conflicting results (low quality evidence).

Further longer-term research on large representative groups of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes (characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels.) mellitus (characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels.) is necessary.

Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality, according to the van Tulder scoring system. Within the subgroup of predominantly mild brain injury, 'strong evidence' suggested that most individuals made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. For moderate to severe injury, 'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) early after injury results in better outcomes. For participants with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.), 'strong evidence' revealed that more intensive programmes are associated with earlier functional gains, and 'moderate evidence' suggested that continued outpatient therapy could help to sustain gains made in early post-acute rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.). The context of multi-disciplinary rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) appears to influence outcomes. 'Strong evidence' supports the use of a milieu-oriented model for patients with severe brain injury, in which comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) takes place in a therapeutic environment and involves a peer group of patients. 'Limited evidence' shows that specialist in-patient rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) and specialist multi-disciplinary community rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) may provide additional functional gains, but studies serve to highlight the particular practical and ethical restraints (placed on the body in order to restrict movement.) imposed on randomisation of severely affected individuals for whom no realistic alternatives to specialist intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) are available. Problems following ABI vary. Consequently, different intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s and combinations of intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s are required to meet the needs of patients with different problems. Patients who present acutely to hospital with mild brain injury benefit from follow-up and appropriate information and advice. Those with moderate to severe brain injury benefit from routine follow-up so their needs for rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) can be assessed. Intensive intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) appears to lead to earlier gains, and earlier intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) whilst still in emergency and acute care has been supported by limited evidence. The balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined. Patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) benefit from access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs. Group-based rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) in a therapeutic milieu (where patients undergo neuropsychological rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) (Physician-supervised programs designed to rehabilitate people with diseases, trauma, or disorders of the NERVOUS SYSTEM.) in a therapeutic environment with a peer group of individuals facing similar challenges) represents an effective approach for patients requiring neuropsychological rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) (Physician-supervised programs designed to rehabilitate people with diseases, trauma, or disorders of the NERVOUS SYSTEM.) following severe brain injury. Not all questions in rehabilitation (Restoration of human functions to the maximum degree possible in a person or persons suffering from disease or injury.) can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. For example, trial-based literature does not tell us which treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care. In the future, such questions will need to be considered alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.",

We found 19 relevant studies, which involved a total of 3480 people. We searched the medical literature worldwide on 14 September 2015. We used the Van Tulder system to rate the strength of the evidence as it distinguished better between trials of different quality than the standard GRADE system on criteria that are important in the context of rehabilitation. For mild brain injury, information and advice were usually more appropriate than intensive rehabilitation. As a whole, studies suggest that patients with moderate to severe brain injury who received more intensive rehabilitation showed earlier improvement, and that earlier rehabilitation was better than delayed treatment. Strong evidence supports the provision of cognitive rehabilitation in a therapeutic 'milieu', that is, an environment in which patients receive predominantly group-based rehabilitation alongside a peer group of others who are facing similar challenges. Trial-based literature provided little evidence related to other aspects of MD rehabilitation, so the review authors recommend that additional research should be done. Rehabilitation for brain injury is such an individualised and long-term process that research studies do not necessarily facilitate general conclusions. Overall the included studies were of good quality; 12 of 19 studies were judged to be of high quality according to the van Tulder scoring system. The other studies were at risk of bias because of elements of their design, for example, in one study, treatment depended on the availability of a bed in the rehabilitation unit. Bed availability is a haphazard way of allocating treatment to patients, and this makes results of the study prone to bias."

Secondary outcomes The mean frequency of breastfeeds per day on day four postpartum for the rooming-in group was 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 2.2), slightly higher than the separate care group, i.e. seven times per day. However, between-group comparison of this outcome was not appropriate since every infant in the separate care group was breastfed at a fixed schedule of seven times per day (SD = 0) resulting in no estimable comparison. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding on day four postpartum before discharge from hospital was significantly higher in the rooming-in group 86% (99 of 115) compared with separate care group, 45% (17 of 38), (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.76; one trial, 153 women; low-quality evidence). None of our other pre-specified secondary outcomes were reported. We found little evidence to support or refute the practice of rooming-in versus mother-infant separation.

The effect was more certain in the four trials where the nerves were located using the more precise method of neurostimulation.

The average decrease, calculated through meta-analysis, was -1.54 cm per year (95% CI -1.15, -1.94). In children with mild-moderate asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.), beclomethasone (An anti-inflammatory, synthetic glucocorticoid.) 200 mcg twice daily caused a decrease in linear growth of -1.54 cm per year. These studies lasted a maximum of 54 weeks, so it remains unclear whether the decrease in growth is sustained or whether it reverses with 'catch up' after therapy is discontinued. We are unable to comment on growth effects of other inhaled steroids that have potentially less systemic effects. If inhaled steroids are required to control a child's asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.), we recommend using the minimum dose that effectively controls the child's asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) and closely following growth.",

Nine studies looked at post-treatment postural restrictions (using a neck brace/head movement restrictions/instructions to sleep upright) following the Epley manoeuvre. There was a statistically significant difference found when these restrictions were compared to a control treatment of the Epley manoeuvre alone. Although there was a difference between the groups, adding postural restrictions conferred only a small additional benefit since the Epley manoeuvre was effective alone in just under 80% of patients. Four of the studies reported minor complications such as neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV (a subtype of BPPV which is similar to posterior canal BPPV, but has some distinct differences in terms of the signs and symptoms), dizziness and disequilibrium (the feeling of unsteadiness on ones feet) in some patients. Additionally, two studies looked into the application of oscillation/vibration to the mastoid region during the Epley manoeuvre compared to control; the intervention produced no difference in outcome between these groups. One study that also researched post-treatment postural restrictions looked into extra steps in the Epley manoeuvre. Compared to the control treatment there were no significant differences in outcomes. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies in the review. The results should be interpreted carefully and further trials are needed."

All participants also received topical steroids (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) but doses and types were the same between the treatment arms of each study, except for the study using antibiotics (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.). In that study, the medical treatment (The administration of a drug to a patient.) arm had higher doses than the surgical arm (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.). In two of the studies, the authors failed to report the outcomes of interest. Although there were important differences in the types of treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) and comparisons used in these studies, the results were similar. Primary outcomes: symptom scores (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) and quality of life scores There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) or the health-related quality of life scores.

One study (ESS (A highly malignant subset of neoplasms arising from the endometrial stroma.) versus systemic steroids (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.)) reported a large, significant effect size in the surgical group, with a mean difference (MD) in score of -1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to -1.22, n = 95) on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = no polyposis (The development of numerous polyps (growths that protrude from a mucous membrane).), 3 = severe polyposis (The development of numerous polyps (growths that protrude from a mucous membrane).)).

Complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) Complication rates (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) were not reported in all studies, but rates of up to 21% for medical treatment (The administration of a drug to a patient.) and 14.3% for surgical treatment (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) are described. Epistaxis (Bleeding from the nose.) was the most commonly reported complication (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) with both medical and surgical treatment (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.)s (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.)

                "Four randomised controlled trials, involving a total of 231 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, are included in this review. The number of patients in each study ranged from 34 to 109. The studies took place in ENT departments in several European countries. All patients were adults and most of the studies enrolled more men than women. In all studies the patients were randomly assigned to either surgery or medical treatment (such as antibiotics or steroid tablets or injections) in addition to topical steroids given as nasal sprays or drops. Both the type of surgery performed and the medical treatments used varied widely between the studies, and did not allow all of the studies to be looked at together. Rather, we considered the treatment groups in the four studies as three separate pairs of comparisons instead of simply 'surgical' versus 'medical' treatments. The main outcome measures were patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores and health-related quality of life scores, as well as generic health-related quality of life scores. There were no important differences between groups in either the patient-reported disease-specific symptom scores or the health-related quality of life scores. Two studies (one comparing ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid, the other ESS versus systemic steroids) did not find a difference in general health-related quality of life scores. Two studies reported changes in polyp size (when looked at with an endoscope) using a score. One study (ESS versus systemic steroids) reported a significantly better score in the surgery group than in the steroids group at 12 months. In the other study (ESS plus topical steroid versus antibiotics plus high-dose topical steroid) no difference was found between the groups. There were no reported differences between the different medical and surgical treatment groups in any study for any other objective (clinician-based) measurements. Complication rates were not reported in all studies, but nosebleeds (epistaxis) were the most commonly described complication with both medical and surgical treatment; severe complications were reported rarely in either group. The evidence does not show that one treatment is better than another in terms of patient-reported symptom scores and quality of life measurements. One positive finding (polyps size scores) from amongst the several studies examining a number of different comparisons must be treated with appropriate caution, in particular when the clinical significance of the measure is uncertain. There is not enough evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the most appropriate treatment for this condition. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps has significant implications for quality of life and the use of healthcare services. Further research to investigate this problem is justified. Overall, we found this evidence to be of low or very low quality. We have low confidence in the estimates of these studies; further research will very likely change these estimates. There were serious limitations in how the studies were carried out or reported (or both), and the number of participants involved was small. In addition, some of the treatment regimens used in the trials are no longer current standards of therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. This evidence is up to date to 20 February 2014."

The risks of feeling intense heat with sweating and rapid heartbeat and of bleeding, the need to get up in the night to urinate, loss of sexual interest, extreme tiredness and the need to urinate more often than usual were increased with castration.

If we assume that screening (Procedures performed on people to identify those who have NEOPLASMS or PRENEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS.) reduces breast cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.) mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening (Procedures performed on people to identify those who have NEOPLASMS or PRENEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS.) throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.) and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) if there had not been screening (Procedures performed on people to identify those who have NEOPLASMS or PRENEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS.), will be treated unnecessarily.

                "Screening with mammography uses X-ray imaging to find breast cancer before a lump can be felt. The goal is to treat cancer earlier, when a cure is more likely. The review includes seven trials that involved 600,000 women in the age range 39 to 74 years who were randomly assigned to receive screening mammograms or not. The studies which provided the most reliable information showed that screening did not reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies that were potentially more biased (less carefully done) found that screening reduced breast cancer mortality. However, screening will result in some women getting a cancer diagnosis even though their cancer would not have led to death or sickness. Currently, it is not possible to tell which women these are, and they are therefore likely to have breasts or lumps removed and to receive radiotherapy unnecessarily. If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% after 13 years of follow-up and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings.

Recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening."

The included participants were heterogeneous in terms of their distribution of age, gender, main diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.), setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) criteria, year of publication, and origin of infection (An illness caused by an infectious agent or its toxins that occurs through the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent or its products from an infected individual or via an animal, vector or the inanimate environment to a susceptible animal or human host.), among other factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.). Prevalence of sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) greatly varied across studies, ranging from 12% to 78%. We considered all studies to be at high risk of bias due to issues related to the index test domain in QUADAS-2. The SROC curve showed a great dispersion in individual studies accuracy estimates (21 studies, 3650 adult patients), therefore the considerable heterogeneity in the collected data prevented (brand of veterinary medicine) us from calculating formal accuracy estimates. Using a fixed prevalence of sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) of 50% and a fixed specificity of 74%, we found a sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) of 66% (95% confidence interval 60 to 72). If we test a cohort 1000 adult patients under suspicion of sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) with IL-6 (also a growth factor for HYBRIDOMAS and plasmacytomas.), we will find that 330 patients would receive appropriate and timely antibiotic therapy (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.), while 130 patients would be wrongly considered to have sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.). In addition, 370 out of 1000 patients would avoid unnecessary antibiotic therapy (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.), and 170 patients would have been undiagnosed of sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.).

Our evidence assessment of plasma interleukin-6 (also a growth factor for HYBRIDOMAS and plasmacytomas.) concentrations for the diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) in critically ill (possible or imminent.) adults reveals several limitations. High heterogeneity of collected evidence regarding the main diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.), setting, country, positivity threshold, sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) criteria, year of publication, and the origin of infection (An illness caused by an infectious agent or its toxins that occurs through the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent or its products from an infected individual or via an animal, vector or the inanimate environment to a susceptible animal or human host.), among other factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.), along with the potential number of misclassifications, remain significant constraints for its implementation. The 20 conference proceedings assessed as studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once they are fully published and evaluated. Further studies about the accuracy of interleukin-6 (also a growth factor for HYBRIDOMAS and plasmacytomas.) for the diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) in adults that apply rigorous methodology for conducting diagnostic test (heading term for tests not treed elsewhere under DIAGNOSIS.) accuracy studies are needed.

We found 23 studies enrolling 4192 severely ill adults. Our assessment of the evidence reveals the complexity of the research topic, represented in the high variability of information reported by the studies. We found the characteristics of assessed patients to vary considerably between studies in terms of age, gender, setting, initial diagnosis, indicative value for sepsis, and source of infection, among other factors. This variability in the collected data prevented a formal numerical synthesis of the findings. Using the available data to perform an approximated estimation of the consequences, we found that 700 out of 1000 patients under suspicion of sepsis might be correctly classified, but 130 out of 1000 patients would be wrongly considered as having sepsis, while 170 out of 1000 patients might be incorrectly considered as not having sepsis. These errors would result in a serious increase in the risk of further morbidity and death due to delays of adequate treatment. This information should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the collected data.

Studies were small, reported low numbers of SSI events and were often not clearly reported. There were 16 trials that included people with wounds resulting from surgical procedures (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) with a 'clean' classification, five trials that included people undergoing what was considered 'clean/contaminated' surgery, with the remaining studies including people undergoing a variety of surgical procedures (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) with different contamination classifications. Four trials compared wound dressings with no wound dressing (wound exposure); the remaining 25 studies compared alternative dressing types, with the majority comparing a basic wound contact dressing (The material used for protecting the wound site from external factors that disrupt healing and cause infection and pain.) with film dressings, silver dressings or hydrocolloid dressings (Dressings comprised of a self-adhesive matrix to which hydrophilic absorbent particles are embedded.). The review contains 11 comparisons in total. Primary outcome: SSI It is uncertain whether wound exposure or any dressing reduces or increases the risk of SSI compared with alternative options investigated: we assessed the certainty of evidence as very low for most comparisons (and low for others), with downgrading (according to GRADE criteria) largely due to risk of bias and imprecision. We summarise the results of comparisons with meta-analysed data below: - film dressings compared with basic wound contact dressing (The material used for protecting the wound site from external factors that disrupt healing and cause infection and pain.)s following clean surgery (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.55), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. - hydrocolloid dressings (Dressings comprised of a self-adhesive matrix to which hydrophilic absorbent particles are embedded.) compared with basic wound contact dressing (The material used for protecting the wound site from external factors that disrupt healing and cause infection and pain.)s following clean surgery (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.78), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. - hydrocolloid dressings (Dressings comprised of a self-adhesive matrix to which hydrophilic absorbent particles are embedded.) compared with basic wound contact dressing (The material used for protecting the wound site from external factors that disrupt healing and cause infection and pain.)s following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.51), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. - silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressing (The material used for protecting the wound site from external factors that disrupt healing and cause infection and pain.)s following clean surgery (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.62), very low certainty evidence downgraded once for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. - silver-containing dressings compared with basic wound contact dressing (The material used for protecting the wound site from external factors that disrupt healing and cause infection and pain.)s following potentially contaminated surgery (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.37), very low certainty evidence downgraded twice for risk of bias and twice for imprecision. Secondary outcomes There was limited and low or very low certainty evidence on secondary outcomes such as scarring (The formation of fibrous tissue in the place of normal tissue during the process of WOUND HEALING.), acceptability of dressing and ease of removal (removed.), and uncertainty whether wound dressings influenced these outcomes. It is uncertain whether covering surgical wounds healing by primary intention with wound dressings reduces the risk of SSI, or whether any particular wound dressing is more effective than others in reducing the risk of SSI, improving scarring (The formation of fibrous tissue in the place of normal tissue during the process of WOUND HEALING.), reducing pain, improving acceptability to patients, or is easier to remove.

This review examined data from 29 randomised controlled trials (which provide the most reliable evidence). These investigated the use of dressings in surgery that had a low risk of surgical site infection (clean surgery) and surgery with a higher risk (potentially contaminated surgery). We found no clear evidence to suggest that one dressing type was better than any other at reducing the risk of surgical site infection, nor that covering wounds with any dressing at all reduced the risk of surgical site infection. Additionally, there was no clear evidence that any dressing type improves scarring, pain control, patient acceptability or ease of removal. Currently decision makers may opt to make decisions about whether and how to dress a wound based on patient and clinician preferences and dressing costs. It is important to note that many trials in this review were small and the evidence was of low or very low certainty meaning that current information is uncertain.

One study examined the effect of selenium supplements taken by women from the first trimester to birth in preventing postnatal depression. This study had a high risk of bias because of women withdrawing or not completing their self-scoring system for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). It may also have been difficult to ensure that the women took their supplements because of concerns that exist about taking supplements during pregnancy. More high-quality studies would be required to confirm any benefit in preventing postnatal depression using selenium. This review also identified one randomised controlled study that compared docosahexanoic and eicosapentaenoic acid to placebo in women at risk of postpartum depression. This study found that neither docosahexanoic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid prevented postpartum depression. Overall, there is not enough evidence at this stage to recommend selenium, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or any other dietary supplement for the prevention of postnatal depression. Unfortunately there were no other studies of other dietary supplements that met our selection criteria. Other dietary supplements need to be studied in trials where depressed women are excluded from entry to determine if supplements prevent postnatal depression."

Visual inspection (Watching something and taking note of what happens.) of the results for these outcomes showed inconsistencies among studies, with differences in the direction of effect, and we did not pool these data for meta-analysis. We considered duration of hypothermia therapy (intentionally induced in warm-blooded animals by artificial means.) and the length of follow-up in collected data for these subgroups; differences in study data remained such that we did not perform meta-analysis. Studies were generally poorly reported and we were unable to assess risk of bias adequately. Heterogeneity was evident both in the trial designs and participant inclusion. Inconsistencies in results may be explained by heterogeneity among study participants or bias introduced by individual study methodology but we did not explore this in detail in subgroup or sensitivity analyses.

These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of the studies, the delay between the tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) was unclear or longer than four weeks; in eight (50%), the blinding of either the index test or the reference standard was not clearly reported or was not performed; and in two studies (12%), the interpretation of the reference standard was not clearly reported. Eleven studies evaluated the accuracy of CE-CDUS. These studies were of better quality than the CDUS studies: five (45%) studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; four (36%) did not report clearly the blinding interpretation of the reference standard; and two (18%) did not clearly report the delay between the two tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.). Based on the bivariate model, the summary estimates for CDUS were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.91) for sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.96) for specificity whereas for CE-CDUS the estimates were 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.98) for sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) for specificity. Regression analysis showed that CE-CDUS was superior to CDUS in terms of sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) (LR Chi2 = 5.08, 1 degree of freedom (df); P = 0.0242 for model improvement). Seven studies provided estimates before and after administration of contrast. Sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) before contrast was 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.83) and after contrast was 0.97 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). The improvement in sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) with of contrast use was statistically significant (LR Chi2 = 13.47, 1 df; P = 0.0002 for model improvement). Regression testing (Return to a former state; a subsidence of the symptoms of a disease process; in cancer, a decrease in the size of a tumor or in the extent of cancer in the body.) showed evidence of statistically significant effect bias related to year of publication and study quality within individual participants based CDUS studies. Sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) estimates were higher in the studies published before 2006 than the estimates obtained from studies published in 2006 or later (P < 0.001); and studies judged as low/unclear quality provided higher estimates in sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.). When regression testing (Return to a former state; a subsidence of the symptoms of a disease process; in cancer, a decrease in the size of a tumor or in the extent of cancer in the body.) was applied to the individual based CE-CDUS studies, none of the items, namely direction of the study design, quality, and age, were identified as a source of heterogeneity. Twenty-two studies provided accuracy data based on number of scan (The production of an image obtained by cameras that detect the radioactive emissions of an injected radionuclide as it has distributed differentially throughout tissues in the body.)s (A picture of structures inside the body.) performed (of which four provided data with and without the use of contrast). Analysis of the studies that provided scan (The production of an image obtained by cameras that detect the radioactive emissions of an injected radionuclide as it has distributed differentially throughout tissues in the body.) based data showed similar results. Summary estimates for CDUS (18 studies) showed 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) for sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.96) for specificity whereas summary estimates for CE-CDUS (eight studies) were 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.98) for sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.96) for specificity. This review demonstrates that both ultrasound (The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues.) modalities (with or without contrast) showed high specificity. For ruling in endoleak (Postoperative hemorrhage from an endovascular AORTIC ANEURYSM repaired with endoluminal placement of stent grafts (BLOOD VESSEL PROSTHESIS IMPLANTATION).)s, CE-CDUS appears superior to CDUS. In an endoleak (Postoperative hemorrhage from an endovascular AORTIC ANEURYSM repaired with endoluminal placement of stent grafts (BLOOD VESSEL PROSTHESIS IMPLANTATION).) surveillance programme CE-CDUS can be introduced as a routine diagnostic (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) modality followed by CT scan (Tomography using x-ray transmission and a computer algorithm to reconstruct the image.) (The production of an image obtained by cameras that detect the radioactive emissions of an injected radionuclide as it has distributed differentially throughout tissues in the body.) only when the ultrasound (The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues.) is positive to establish the type of endoleak (Postoperative hemorrhage from an endovascular AORTIC ANEURYSM repaired with endoluminal placement of stent grafts (BLOOD VESSEL PROSTHESIS IMPLANTATION).) and the subsequent therapeutic management.",

We included 42 studies with 4220 participants in the review. The analyses measured sensitivity (how well a test identified people with endoleak correctly) and specificity (how well a test identified people without endoleak correctly). The summary accuracy estimates were sensitivity 82% (95% confidence interval 66% to 91%) and specificity 93% (95% confidence interval 87% to 96%) for ultrasonography without contrast; and sensitivity 94% (95% confidence interval 85% to 98%) and specificity 95% (95% confidence interval 90% to 98%) for ultrasonography with contrast. Use of contrast improved the sensitivity of ultrasound significantly. Based on these results, we would expect 94% of people with endoleaks will be correctly identified by contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Studies that evaluated contrast-enhanced ultrasound used better methods than the studies that evaluated ultrasound alone."

However, failure to demonstrate a normal distribution for pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity or relief, and use of different scales (A device designed for weighing or an indicator device with a graduated sequence of divisions.), meant meta-analysis was inappropriate.

The overall postoperative chronic pain (Aching sensation that persists for more than a few months.) in the glue group was reduced by 37% (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91; 10 studies, 1418 participants, low-quality evidence) compared with the suture (Materials used in closing a surgical or traumatic wound.) group. However, the results changed when we conducted subgroup analysis with regard to the type of mesh. Subgroup analysis of included studies using lightweight mesh showed the reduction of chronic pain (Aching sensation that persists for more than a few months.) was less profound and insignificant (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.17). Subgroup analysis of included studies using heavyweight mesh resulted in a significant benefit from the fixation (The act or operation (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) with glue (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.82). Hernia recurrence was similar between the two groups (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.28; 12 studies, 1932 participants, low-quality evidence). Fixation (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) with glue was superior to suture (Materials used in closing a surgical or traumatic wound.) regarding duration of the operation (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.)

We also investigated adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). There were no significant differences between the two groups. For superficial wound infection (Invasion of a wound by pathogenic microorganisms.) pooled analyses showed OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.37 to 4.11; 7 studies, 763 participants (low-quality evidence); for mesh/deep infection OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.83; 8 studies, 1393 participants (low-quality evidence). Furthermore, we investigated seroma (A tumor-like collection of serum in the tissues.) (a postoperative swelling caused by fluid) (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.33); and persisting numbness (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.14). Finally, six trials involving 1009 participants reported postoperative length of stay, resulting in non-significant difference between the two groups (MD \u22120.12, 95% CI: \u22120.35 to 0.10) Due to the lack of data, it was impossible to draw any distinction between synthetic glue and biological glue. Eight out of 12 trials showed high risk of bias in at least one of the investigated domains. Two studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and the allocation sequence of one trial was not concealed. Nearly half of the included trials either did not provide adequate information or had high risk of bias regarding blinding processes. The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies varied from low to high risk of bias. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant (An autologous or commercial tissue adhesive containing FIBRINOGEN and THROMBIN.). Therefore, according to the 'Summary of findings' tables, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low. Based on the short-term results, glue may reduce postoperative chronic pain (Aching sensation that persists for more than a few months.) and not simultaneously increase the recurrence rate, compared with suture (Materials used in closing a surgical or traumatic wound.)s (Materials used in closing a surgical or traumatic wound.) for mesh fixation (The act or operation (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) in Lichtenstein hernia repair. Glue may therefore be a sensible alternative to suture (Materials used in closing a surgical or traumatic wound.) for mesh fixation (The act or operation (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) in Lichtenstein repair.

                "We identified 12 relevant randomised controlled trials comparing glue versus suture for fixation of the mesh, with a total of 1932 participants. Glue fixation is superior to suture for the outcomes of chronic pain, duration of operation, haematoma and recovery time to daily activities. Glue fixation is not associated with an increased risk of infection, hernia recurrence, seroma (a collection of fluid that builds up under the surface of the skin after surgery), persisting numbness (loss of sensation or feeling), quality of life, and postoperative length of stay. We do not know the role of glue fixation in people with recurrent hernia, femoral hernia or complicated hernia. Meanwhile no conclusions could be drawn on which type of glue should be used because of lack of trials. Eight out of 12 trials showed high risk of bias in at least one of the investigated domains. Two studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials. Nearly half of the included trials either did not provide adequate information or had high risk of bias regarding blinding processes. The risk of bias for incomplete outcome data of all the included studies is low to high. Two trials did not report on some important outcomes. One study was funded by the manufacturer producing the fibrin sealant. As the quality of the evidence (GRADE) for the outcomes is moderate to low and the results of chronic pain is not robust, the findings should be interpreted with caution. However, the evidence is still sufficient to conclude that glue fixation of mesh for the Lichtenstein procedure is comparable, if not superior, to fixation with suture. Glue may be a sensible alternative to suture for mesh fixation in Lichtenstein repair."

All studies were performed on adults; there were no studies on children. The included studies were of adequate methodological quality, but all except for one were judged to be at a high risk of bias because of small study size, and six because of methods used to deal with missing data or high withdrawal rates. Three studies used a parallel group design; the remainder were cross-over trials in which there was an adequate washout period, but only one reported results for treatment periods separately. Twelve studies used codeine (An opioid analgesic related to MORPHINE but with less potent analgesic properties and mild sedative effects.) as a single agent and three combined it with paracetamol (Analgesic antipyretic derivative of acetanilide.). Ten studies included a placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) arm, and 14 included one or more of 16 different active drug comparators or compared different routes of administration.

Adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) reporting was poor: only two studies reported the number of participants with any adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) specified by treatment group and only one reported the number of participants with any serious adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). In multiple-dose studies nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.), vomiting (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) and constipation (Infrequent or difficult evacuation of FECES.) were common, with somnolence and dizziness (An imprecise term which may refer to a sense of spatial disorientation, motion of the environment, or lightheadedness.) frequent in the 21-day study. Withdrawal from the studies, where reported, was less than 10% except in two studies.

They also reported results in different ways, so that it was not possible to combine results. In seven of the eight studies that compared codeine with placebo, codeine was better than placebo. In studies that compared codeine with another drug, the results were similar. Codeine at doses of 30 mg to 120 mg, alone or in combination with paracetamol, does seem to provide a good level of pain relief for some people with cancer pain. We cannot be certain about how many people will get this benefit, and we do not know whether, or by how much, adding paracetamol increases its effect. Codeine increases nausea, vomiting, and constipation, and may cause drowsiness or dizziness if used for more than a week. Some people will stop taking codeine because of the side effects. More trials comparing codeine with other treatments and using patient-centred outcomes are needed.

Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and the post-intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) assessments ranged from the end of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) period to 12 months after completion. The heterogeneity of the included trials, which encompasses setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria, intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)al method and time of assessment, ranged from 'not important' to 'moderate to substantial' for different review outcomes. The overall risk of bias was low for selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and blinding of outcome assessment. Incomplete outcome reporting and blinding of personnel showed mixed bias representations. Patient knowledge was assessed by four trials (160 participants) with moderate to substantial heterogeneity. There was evidence that educational programs improved patient knowledge, standardised mean difference 0.87 points (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 1.45, moderate quality evidence), which improved further when a trial with high bias was removed in a sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) analysis. Caregiver knowledge, reported in a single trial of 20 families, also showed an improvement, standardised mean difference 0.52 points (95% confidence interval 0.03 to 1.00, moderate quality evidence). The effect on patient knowledge was sustained at longer follow-up periods, whereas the effect on caregiver knowledge was not sustained. There were two primary outcomes related to the effectiveness of educational programs on the recognition of signs and symptoms of disease-related morbidity. No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self-management. Data from two trials were analysed for the utilization of health services and showed no evidence of an effect, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -0.57 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence). With regard to the review's secondary outcomes, depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.) showed a statistically significant decline in intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) groups, standardised mean difference -0.66 points (95% confidence interval -1.18, to -0.14, moderate quality evidence). Adherence to treatment was not assessed in any of the identified trials. No effects of intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s were seen on coping, family relationships or health-related quality of life of patients. The quality of evidence was low for positive coping and moderate for child knowledge, healthcare utilization and depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.). This suggests that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimates. This review identifies important positive effects of educational intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s on improving patient knowledge of sickle cell disease (A disease characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, episodic painful crises, and pathologic involvement of many organs.) and depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.). Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effect on knowledge was significant but small and whether it offers any clinical benefit is uncertain. Significant factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.) limiting these effects could be trials being under powered as well as attrition rates. Effects were not statistically significant in assessments of secondary outcomes, possibly due to the paucity of the number of trials and patients and caregivers. Trials showed moderate to high heterogeneity which might impact the results. To better study effects on outcomes, further controlled trials are needed with rigorous attention given to improve recruitment and retention and to decrease bias.

Interventions ranged from a total of one hour to weekly sessions for eight weeks and post-intervention assessments ranged from the end of the intervention period to 12 months after completion. Educational programs and other interventions have resulted in improvements in patient knowledge or understanding of sickle cell disease, and a decrease in depression. Effects on patients' knowledge were maintained for longer than for caregivers. The effects are shown to be small but may result from the fact that most studies had very small numbers of participants and there was much variation between studies. The interventions studied showed no effect on patients' utilization of health services, relationships between families, caregiver or patient skills, coping or health-related quality of life of the patient. No comparative data were reported for patients or caregivers (or both) recognising signs and symptoms leading to self-management. No trials assessed the adherence to treatment.

Only one study included participants with both focal and generalised onset seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.)s (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.); the other five trials included participants with focal onset seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.)s (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) only. All six studies included adult participants between 16 and 80 years old, and treatment periods ranged from 7 to 16 weeks. We judged two studies to have low risk of bias and four to have unclear risk of bias. One study failed to provide details on the method used for allocation concealment, and one did not report all outcomes prespecified in the trial protocol. One study did not describe how blinding was maintained, and another noted discrepancies in reporting. Participants receiving brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) add-on were significantly more likely to experience a 50% or greater reduction in seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) frequency than those receiving placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.14; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Participants receiving brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) were also significantly more likely to attain seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) freedom (RR 5.89, 95% CI 2.30 to 15.13; 6 studies; moderate-quality evidence). The incidence of treatment withdrawal for any reason (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.74; 6 studies; low-quality evidence), as well as the risk of participants experiencing one or more adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.17; 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence), was not significantly different following treatment with brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.). However, participants receiving brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) did appear to be significantly more likely to withdraw from treatment specifically because of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) compared with those receiving placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.33; 6 studies; low-quality evidence). Brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.), when used as add-on therapy for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (A disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal brain dysfunction due to a sudden, disorderly, and excessive neuronal discharge.) (Epileptic condition in which adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS schedules to achieve sustained seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) freedom failed.), is effective in reducing seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) frequency and can aid patients in achieving seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) freedom. However, add-on brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) is associated with a greater proportion of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) compared with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.). It is important to note that only one of the eligible studies included participants with generalised epilepsy (A disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal brain dysfunction due to a sudden, disorderly, and excessive neuronal discharge.). None of the studies included participants under the age of 16, and all studies were of short duration. Consequently, these findings are mainly applicable to adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy (A disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal brain dysfunction due to a sudden, disorderly, and excessive neuronal discharge.). Future research should thus focus on investigating the tolerability and efficacy of brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) during longer-term follow-up, and should also assess the efficacy and tolerability of add-on brivaracetam (An orally bioavailable levetiracetam derivative, with anticonvulsant activity.) in managing other types of seizure (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.)s (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.) and its use in other age groups.",

                "Evidence taken from studies examining the effectiveness of brivaracetam was of moderate quality. This means that we can be fairly certain that study findings showing that brivaracetam is effective in reducing the frequency of seizures in drug-resistant epilepsy are accurate. Evidence regarding the tolerability of brivaracetam, for example, the number of people who withdrew from these studies and the number of people who experienced side effects, however, was of low quality. This means that we cannot be sure that trial findings are completely accurate, and that more research is needed to fully investigate the tolerability of brivaracetam. All study participants were adults, and most had focal epilepsy. As a result, the review cannot inform us about how effective brivaracetam is in children or in individuals with other types of epilepsy, for example, generalised epilepsy, which is epilepsy that involves the whole brain. Evidence is current to October 2018."

None of the interventions appeared to respond to negative media stories or address parental perceptions of health worker motives. We have high or moderate confidence in the evidence contributing to several review findings. Further research, especially in rural and low- to middle-income country settings, could strengthen evidence for the findings where we had low or very low confidence. Planners should consider the timing for making vaccination (Administration of vaccines to stimulate the host's immune response.) information available to parents, the settings where information is available, the provision of impartial and clear information tailored to parental needs, and parents' perceptions of health workers and the information provided.",

Seven had been identified in the previous versions of this review and we now include three new trials. We now deem one previously identified ongoing trial to be ineligible, and six ongoing trials are new for this update. Two of the 10 trials included children. Trials tested diverse psychological therapies and comparability was poor. Risks of bias were mostly evident through lack of blinded outcome assessments (in 60% of studies) and incomplete data reporting (attrition bias). The results suggest that treatment as usual (TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.)) when delivered by a non-eating-disorder specialist or similar may be less efficacious than focal psychodynamic therapy. This was suggested for a primary outcome of recovery by achievement of a good or intermediate outcome on the Morgan and Russell Scale (RR 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 40 participants; very low-quality evidence). However there were no differences between cognitive analytic therapy and TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.) for this outcome (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00; 2 RCTs, 71 participants; very low-quality evidence), nor for body mass index (BMI). There were no differences in overall dropout rates between individual psychological therapies and TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.). Two trials found a non-specific specialist therapy (Specialist Supportive Clinical Management) or an Optimised TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.) delivered by therapists with eating disorder (A broad group of psychological disorders with abnormal eating behaviors leading to physiological effects from overeating or insufficient food intake.) expertise was similar in outcomes to cognitive behaviour therapy (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) (BMI MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.91; 197 participants, low-quality evidence). When comparing individual psychological therapies with each other, no specific treatment was consistently superior to any other specific approach. Dietary advice as a control arm had a 100% non-completion rate in one trial (35 participants). None of the trials identified any adverse effects. Insufficient power was problematic for the majority of trials. There was a suggestion in one trial that focal psychodynamic therapy might be superior to TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.), but this is in the context of TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.) performing poorly. An alternative control condition of dietary advice alone appeared to be unacceptable, but again this is based on just one trial. Owing to the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa (characterized by the lack or loss of APPETITE, known as ANOREXIA.) in adults or older adolescents. Larger RCTs of longer treatment duration and follow-up are needed.",

Because of the risk of bias and limitations of studies, notably small sample sizes, we can draw no specific conclusions about the effects of specific individual psychological therapies for anorexia nervosa in adults or older adolescents.

One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) or perfluropropane (A fluorinated hydrocarbon and gaseous substance used as an imaging contrast agent.) (C3F8) gas tamponades. The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.)) versus standard silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference). In participants with RD associated with PVR (Vitreoretinal (The ten-layered nervous tissue membrane of the eye.) membrane shrinkage or contraction secondary to the proliferation of primarily retinal (The ten-layered nervous tissue membrane of the eye.) pigment epithelial cells and glial cells, particularly fibrous astrocytes, followed by membrane formation.), outcomes after pars plana (An annular zone of the ciliary body continuous with the retina at the ora serrata and covered with ciliary plicae.) vitrectomy (Removal of the whole or part of the vitreous body in treating endophthalmitis, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, intraocular foreign bodies, and some types of glaucoma.) and infusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) of either silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.), perfluropropane (A fluorinated hydrocarbon and gaseous substance used as an imaging contrast agent.) gas (A fluorinated hydrocarbon and gaseous substance used as an imaging contrast agent.), or sulfur hexafluoride gas appeared comparable for a broad variety of cases. There were no significant differences between silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) and perfluoropropane gas (A fluorinated hydrocarbon and gaseous substance used as an imaging contrast agent.) in terms of the proportion of participants achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.31) or achieving macular attachment (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) at a minimum of one year. Although sulfur hexafluoride gas was reported to be associated with significantly worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) at one year (quantitative data not reported), there were no significant differences between silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) and sulfur hexafluoride gas in terms of achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66). For macular attachment (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.), participants treated with silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) received significantly more favourable outcomes than did participants who received sulfur hexafluoride at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86). The first two trials did not perform any sample size calculation or power detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.). In the third trial, which had a power of 80% to detect differences, heavy silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) was not shown to be superior to standard silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.). There were no significant differences between standard silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) and heavy silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) in the change in visual acuity at one year using adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29). Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were not reported for the first two trials. For the third trial, only the total number of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) was reported, and adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) for each group were not specified. Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal (The ten-layered nervous tissue membrane of the eye.) detachment, 22 developed glaucoma (An ocular disease, occurring in many forms, having as its primary characteristics an unstable or a sustained increase in the intraocular pressure which the eye cannot withstand without damage to its structure or impairment of its function.), four developed a cataract, and two had capsular fibrosis. All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors. The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias. All trials appear to be free of reporting bias. The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation. The use of either perfluropropane (A fluorinated hydrocarbon and gaseous substance used as an imaging contrast agent.) or standard silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.) appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR (Vitreoretinal (The ten-layered nervous tissue membrane of the eye.) membrane shrinkage or contraction secondary to the proliferation of primarily retinal (The ten-layered nervous tissue membrane of the eye.) pigment epithelial cells and glial cells, particularly fibrous astrocytes, followed by membrane formation.). Because there do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between the two agents (Drugs used for their effects on the kidneys' regulation of body fluid composition and volume.), the choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient. Heavy silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.), which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has not demonstrated evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil (Organic siloxanes which are polymerized to the oily stage.)

                "We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 516 participants that compared tamponade agents. All participants underwent surgery to treat RD associated with PVR. The Silicone Study compared the use of silicone oil to either sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas in two RCTs. Both gases and silicone oil are less dense than water, so that they float upwards or towards the top of the eye while a patient is sitting or standing. This is sometimes but not always beneficial, so a denser-than-water silicone oil called heavy silicone oil has been investigated, primarily outside the US. The Heavy Silicone Oil Study compared the use of heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil in participants with RD involving the lower parts of the retina. The evidence was current to June 2013. When silicone oil was compared to SF6 gas, eyes randomized to receive silicone oil more often achieved a visual acuity of 5/200 or better at one year, and more often achieved macular attachment at one year but with no difference at two years. When silicone oil was compared with C3F8 gas, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to visual acuity or macular attachment at one year. When heavy silicone oil was compared to standard silicone oil, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to retinal re-attachment or visual acuity at one year. Heavy silicone oil did not demonstrate any significant benefit over standard silicone oil. Adverse events were only reported for the Heavy Silicone Oil Study; however, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and the numbers for each group were not specified: of the 94 participants, there were four deaths, 26 recurrent RDs, 22 patients with glaucoma, four patients with cataract, and two patients with capsular fibrosis (scarring behind a lens implant). The overall quality of these studies was moderately satisfactory.

Two fairly large, well-designed trials with overall low risk of bias contributed the majority of the evidence. Other studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. No studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation, potentially introducing bias as women and staff would have been aware of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making (Process of formulating a diagnosis based on medical history and physical or mental examinations, and/or choosing an appropriate intervention.).

Where the evidence was downgraded, it was mostly because the confidence intervals were wide, crossing both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm. For women suffering (Severe psychological and/or spiritual distress.) from hypertensive disorders (Persistently high systemic arterial BLOOD PRESSURE.) of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery (Delivery of the FETUS and PLACENTA under the care of an obstetrician or a health worker.) is associated with less composite maternal morbidity and mortality. There is no clear difference in the composite outcome of infant mortality and severe morbidity; however, this is based on limited data (from two trials) assessing all hypertensive disorders (Persistently high systemic arterial BLOOD PRESSURE.) as one group. Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive disease (Persistently high systemic arterial BLOOD PRESSURE.)s and the optimal timing of delivery (Delivery of the FETUS and PLACENTA under the care of an obstetrician or a health worker.) for these condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.)s.

Fewer women who received planned early delivery experienced severe adverse outcomes (1459 women, high-quality evidence). There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on the number of babies born with poor health, with a high level of variability between the two studies (1459 infants, low-quality evidence).

More babies who were delivered early had breathing problems (respiratory distress syndrome, three studies, 1511 infants), or were admitted to the neonatal unit (four studies, 1585 infants). Fewer women who delivered early developed HELLP syndrome (three studies, 1628 women) or severe kidney problems (one study, 100 women). Two studies compared women who had labour induced at 34 to 36 weeks and at 34 to 37 weeks with a comparison group who were monitored until 37 weeks, when induction was begun if labour had not started spontaneously. Three studies compared induction of labour at term or closer to term, at 37 completed weeks and at 36 to 41 weeks, with women who were monitored until 41 weeks when induction was begun if labour had not started spontaneously. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria also differed between the five studies. No studies attempted to blind the women or their clinicians to which group they were in. Women and staff were aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making. Most of the evidence was of moderate quality, so we can be moderately certain about the findings. Overall, if a woman\u2019s baby was delivered immediately after 34 weeks, there was less risk of a complication for the mother and no clear difference in the overall rate of complications for the baby, but information was limited. These findings are applicable to general obstetric practice when high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy are considered together.

A (The classic hemophilia (The classic hemophilia resulting from a deficiency of factor VIII.) resulting from a deficiency of factor VIII.); one showed a statistically significant decrease in frequency of joint bleeds (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) with prophylaxis compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), with a rate difference of -10.73 (95% confidence interval -16.55 to -4.91) bleeds (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) per year. Two studies compared two prophylaxis regimen (A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.)s, failing to demonstrate an advantage of one regimen (A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.) over the other in terms of bleeding (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) frequency. The fourth study evaluated hemophilia (The classic hemophilia resulting from a deficiency of factor VIII.) B (A deficiency of blood coagulation factor IX inherited as an X-linked disorder.) and showed fewer joint bleeds (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) with weekly (15 IU/kg) versus bi-weekly (7.5 IU/kg) prophylaxis, rate difference -3.30 (95% confidence interval -5.50 to -1.10) bleeds (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) per year. Non-significant increases in both inhibitor (A class of substances that binds to and inhibits the function or activity of a target.) and infectious complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.)

There is strong evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational trials that prophylaxis preserves joint function in children with hemophilia (The classic hemophilia resulting from a deficiency of factor VIII.) as compared to on-demand treatment. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to confirm the observational evidence that prophylaxis decreases bleeding (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) and related complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) in patients with existing joint damage. Well-designed randomised controlled trials and prospective observational controlled studies are needed to establish the best prophylactic regimen (A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.) and to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic clotting factor (Endogenous substances, usually proteins, that are involved in the blood coagulation process.) concentrates in adult patients.",

Four compare different regimens of regular use in children and adults with hemophilia. It was clearly evident that preventative therapy, as intravenous infusion of factor concentrate repeated more times a week and started early in childhood was able to reduce joint deterioration as compared to treatment administered after bleeding occurred. This favourable effect is due to a consistent reduction in total bleeds and hemarthrosis (bleeding into joints) and leads to a significant improvement in quality of life. Preventative therapy is linked to an increased factor usage and cost of treatment. We found weaker evidence (due to lack of data) to show preventative therapy reduced joint deterioration when treatment is started after joint damage has been established. Further studies are needed to establish the best preventative regimen, i.e. for example starting time, dosage frequency, minimally effective dose."

It is only possible to blind trials of airway clearance and overnight ventilatory (A medical device that facilitates breathing.) support to the outcome assessors. In most of the trials we judged there was an unclear risk of bias with regards to blinding due to inadequate descriptions. The six-week trial was the only one judged to have a low risk of bias for all other domains. One single intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.), or improve health in other ways.) trial had a low risk of bias for the randomisation procedure with the remaining trials judged to have an unclear risk of bias. Most trials had a low risk of bias with regard to incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Six trials (151 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance compared with an alternative chest physiotherapy method such as the active cycle of breathing techniques or positive expiratory pressure (The maximum amount of pressure applied to the lungs during expiration.). Three trials used nasal masks (Devices that cover the nose and mouth to maintain aseptic conditions or to administer inhaled anesthetics or other gases.), one used a nasal mask or mouthpiece (Aid used for the administration or inhalation of a medicinal product by mouth.) and one trial used a face mask and in one trial it is unclear. Three of the trials reported on one of the review's primary outcome measures (quality of life). Results for the reviews secondary outcomes showed that airway clearance may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis (An autosomal recessive genetic disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) of the EXOCRINE GLANDS.) may prefer it. We were unable to find any evidence that non-invasive ventilation increases sputum expectoration, but it did improve some lung function parameters. Three trials (27 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation for overnight ventilatory (A medical device that facilitates breathing.) support compared to oxygen (An element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].) or room air using nasal masks (Devices that cover the nose and mouth to maintain aseptic conditions or to administer inhaled anesthetics or other gases.)

(one trial). Trials reported on two of the review's primary outcomes (quality of life and symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (A group of breathing disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or insufficient ventilation during sleep.)). Results for the reviews secondary outcome measures showed that they measured lung function, gas exchange, adherence to treatment and preference, and nocturnal transcutaneous carbon dioxide. Due to the small numbers of participants and statistical issues, there were discrepancies in the results between the RevMan and the original trial analyses. No clear differences were found between non-invasive ventilation compared with oxygen (An element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].) or room air except for exercise performance, which significantly improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air over six weeks. One trial (13 participants) evaluated non-invasive ventilation on exercise capacity (interface used was unclear) and did not reported on any of the review's primary outcomes. The trial found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation compared to no non-invasive ventilation for any of our outcomes. Three trials reported on adverse effects. One trial, evaluating non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance, reported that a participant withdrew at the start of the trial due to pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) on respiratory muscle (These include the muscles of the DIAPHRAGM and the INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES.) testing. One trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation for overnight support reported that one participant could not tolerate an increase in inspiratory positive airway pressure. A second trial evaluating non-invasive ventilation in this setting reported that one participant did not tolerate the non-invasive ventilation mask, one participant developed a pneumothorax (An accumulation of air or gas in the PLEURAL CAVITY, which may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma or a pathological process.) when breathing room air and two participants experienced aerophagia (Spasmodic swallowing of air.) which resolved (Return to the normal structure and/or function, e.g.) when inspiratory positive airway pressure was decreased. Non-invasive ventilation (Techniques for administering artificial respiration without the need for INTRATRACHEAL INTUBATION.) may be a useful adjunct to other airway clearance techniques, particularly in people with cystic fibrosis (An autosomal recessive genetic disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) of the EXOCRINE GLANDS.) who have difficulty expectorating sputum. Non-invasive ventilation (Techniques for administering artificial respiration without the need for INTRATRACHEAL INTUBATION.), used in addition to oxygen (An element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].), may improve gas exchange during sleep to a greater extent than oxygen (An element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].) therapy alone in moderate to severe disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).

Six single-treatment trials, the two-week trial and the three-month trial compared non-invasive ventilation with other airway clearance techniques. Two single-treatment trials and the six-week trial looked at non-invasive ventilation for overnight breathing support compared to oxygen or normal room air. One single-treatment trial compared non-invasive ventilation with no additional treatment during an exercise test. Single-treatment trials of non-invasive ventilation for airway clearance showed that this may be easier with non-invasive ventilation and people with cystic fibrosis may prefer it to other methods. We could not find evidence that non-invasive ventilation increased the amount of mucus coughed up, but it did improve some measures of lung function, at least in the short term. The two-week trial did not demonstrate clear benefits between groups. The original three-month trial report stated an improvement in lung clearance index. One person in one of these trials reported pain on respiratory muscle testing. The three trials comparing overnight support from non-invasive ventilation measured lung function, quality of life and carbon dioxide levels; they showed it is effective, safe and acceptable. We found no clear differences between non-invasive ventilation and oxygen or room air, except for exercise performance which improved with non-invasive ventilation compared to room air after six weeks. Two trials reported side effects. In the first trial, one person found the mask uncomfortable. In the second trial, one person in the room air group had collapsed lungs and two people could not tolerate increased pressure when breathing in. The trial comparing the effects of non-invasive ventilation to no treatment on exercise capacity found no clear differences between groups. Non-invasive ventilation may help alongside other airway clearance techniques, particularly when people with cystic fibrosis have difficulty coughing up mucus and during sleep. Long-term trials are needed with enough people to show the clinical effects of non-invasive ventilation on airway clearance, during sleep and exercise training in severe disease. The benefits of non-invasive ventilation have largely been demonstrated in single-treatment sessions with only small numbers of people. There is limited evidence of some longer-term improvement in lung function in one trial. Our results from the trials of overnight breathing support differed from those in the original analyses, this is likely due to the small numbers of participants and some statistical issues. We judged only the six-week trial to be free from any bias. In the remaining trials, we thought there were low or unclear chances of the results being affected because data were either reported only partially or not at all. We were not sure if the way in which participants were put into the different treatment groups would affect the results of the trials."

Because some trials had very small numbers of participants, our confidence in the quality of evidence is moderate when looking at the effects on gas exchange. All seven trials measured this outcome.

There were no clear differences between groups for brachial plexus injury (two events were reported in the control group in one trial, low-quality evidence). There was no strong evidence of any difference between groups for measures of neonatal asphyxia (A pathological condition caused by lack of oxygen, manifested in impending or actual cessation of life.); low five-minute infant Apgar scores (less than seven) or low arterial cord blood pH (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.25 to 9.02; 858 infants; two trials, low-quality evidence; and, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.22; 818 infants; one trial, moderate-quality evidence, respectively). Mean birthweight was lower in the induction group, but there was considerable heterogeneity between studies for this outcome (mean difference (MD) -178.03 g, 95% CI -315.26 to -40.81; 1190 infants; four studies; I2 = 89%). In one study with data for 818 women, third- and fourth-degree perineal tears were increased in the induction group (RR 3.70, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.17). For outcomes assessed using GRADE, we based our downgrading decisions on high risk of bias from lack of blinding and imprecision of effect estimates. Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia has not been shown to alter the risk of brachial plexus injury, but the power of the included studies to show a difference for such a rare event is limited. Also antenatal estimates of fetal weight are often inaccurate so many women may be worried unnecessarily, and many inductions may not be needed. Nevertheless, induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia results in a lower mean birthweight, and fewer birth fractures and shoulder dystocia (A birth complication caused by impaction of the anterior shoulder against the maternal symphysis pubis that requires additional maneuvers to relieve impaction of the fetal shoulder and allow for delivery.). The unexpected observation in the induction group of increased perineal damage, and the plausible, but of uncertain significance, observation of increased use of phototherapy (Treatment of disease by exposure to light, especially by variously concentrate (usually diluted prior to administration.)d light rays or specific wavelengths.), both in the largest trial, should also be kept in mind. Findings from trials included in the review suggest that to prevent (brand of veterinary medicine) one fracture it would be necessary to induce labour in 60 women. Since induction of labour does not appear to alter the rate of caesarean delivery (Extraction of the FETUS by means of abdominal HYSTEROTOMY.) or instrumental delivery, it is likely to be popular with many women. In settings where obstetricians can be reasonably confident about their scan (The production of an image obtained by cameras that detect the radioactive emissions of an injected radionuclide as it has distributed differentially throughout tissues in the body.) assessment of fetal weight, the advantages and disadvantages of induction at or near term for fetuses suspected of being macrosomic should be discussed with parents. Although some parents and doctors may feel the evidence already justifies induction, others may justifiably disagree. Further trials of induction shortly before term for suspected fetal macrosomia are needed. Such trials should concentrate (usually diluted prior to administration.) on refining the optimum gestation of induction, and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of macrosomia.",

The evidence was assessed as moderate quality for shoulder dystocia and high quality for fracture. No clear differences between groups were reported for damage to the network of nerves that send signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm and hand (brachial plexus injury) of the baby (low-quality evidence due to very few events occurring) or signs of not enough oxygen during birth. A policy of labour induction reduced the average birthweight of babies by 178 g. The trials did not show any differences in the number of women who had caesarean sections or instrumental births. There is limited evidence that more women in the induction of labour group had severe damage to the perineum. We conclude that there appear to be benefits, but there may also be some disadvantages of induction of labour shortly before term. The option of having an induction should be discussed with parents when their baby is suspected to be extra large. Although some parents and doctors may feel the existing evidence is sufficient to justify inducing labour, others may disagree. Further high-quality studies are needed in order to find out what is the best time to induce labour towards the end of pregnancy, and how to improve the accuracy in diagnosing macrosomia.

Accordingly, 56 randomised trials with 95,286 participants provided usable data on mortality. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 107 years. Most trials included women older than 70 years. The mean proportion of women was 77%. Forty-eight of the trials randomly assigned 94,491 healthy participants. Of these, four trials included healthy volunteers, nine trials included postmenopausal women and 35 trials included older people living on their own or in institutional care. The remaining eight trials randomly assigned 795 participants with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory or rheumatoid diseases (A chronic systemic disease, primarily of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures, widespread fibrinoid degeneration of the collagen fibers in mesenchymal tissues, and by atrophy and rarefaction of bony structures.). Vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) was administered for a weighted mean of 4.4 years. More than half of the trials had a low risk of bias. All trials were conducted in high-income countries.

Vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) decreased mortality in all 56 trials analysed together (5,920/47,472 (12.5%) vs 6,077/47,814 (12.7%); RR 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.99); P = 0.02; I2 = 0%). More than 8% of participants dropped out. 'Worst-best case' and 'best-worst case' scenario analyses demonstrated that vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.) could be associated with a dramatic increase or decrease in mortality.

Trial sequential analysis supported our finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.) regarding vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.)3, with the cumulative Z-score breaking the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit, corresponding to 150 people treated over five years to prevent (brand of veterinary medicine) one additional death.

Vitamin D (A form of vitamin D that helps the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth.)3 combined with calcium (A basic element found in nearly all tissues.) increased the risk of nephrolithiasis (Stones in the KIDNEY, usually formed in the urine-collecting area of the kidney (KIDNEY PELVIS).)

Both alfacalcidol and calcitriol (formed primarily in the kidney by enzymatic hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (CALCIFEDIOL).) increased hypercalcaemia (Abnormally high level of calcium in the blood.).

The mean proportion of women was 77%. Vitamin D was administered for an average of 4.4 years. This plain language summary is as current as of February 2012. This review suggests that vitamin D3 may reduce mortality, showing that about 150 participants need to be treated over five years for one additional life to be saved. We found comparable effects of vitamin D3 in studies that included only women compared with studies including both women and men. Vitamin D3 also seemed to decrease cancer mortality, showing a reduction in mortality of 4 per 1000 persons treated for five to seven years. We also observed adverse effects to vitamin D such as renal stone formation (seen for vitamin D3 combined with calcium) and elevated blood levels of calcium (seen for both alfacalcidol and calcitriol). In conclusion, we found some evidence that vitamin D3 seems to decrease mortality in elderly people not dependent on help or living in institutional care. A large number of study participants left the trial before completion, and this raises concerns regarding the validity of the results. More randomised clinical trials are needed on the effects of vitamin D3 on mortality in younger, healthy persons, as well as in elderly community-dwelling and institutionalised persons without apparent vitamin D deficiency."

This may have been because the numbers of participants in the trials were small, and larger numbers may be required for any differences in the effectiveness of treatments to become clear. Some women find vaginal weights unpleasant or difficult to use, so this treatment may not be useful for all women. Many women with stress urinary incontinence will not be cured by these treatments, and so it is important for trials to assess quality of life during and after treatment, but few of these trials did.

It is likely that further high-quality trials may affect these reported results."

                "This review set out to determine the effectiveness and safety of vaginal prostaglandins for third trimester cervical ripening and induction of labour (the cervix softens, shortens and opens, the uterus starts to contract regularly). Eight different comparisons were made, different vaginal prostaglandins were compared with placebos or no treatment, or other vaginal prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2a, except misoprostol) and different preparations and dosages were compared. We identified 70 studies involving a total of 11,487 women. Vaginal prostaglandins increase the likelihood of vaginal birth within 24 hours, but they can also stimulate the uterus to contract too much and this may cause the baby's heart to slow, however they did not increase the caesarean section rate and may reduce it. Overall, the trials do not show any effect (improvement or worsening) of many important outcomes. Prostaglandin E2 tablets, gels, or pessaries including sustained release preparations appear to be as good as each other or the differences between them are small and have not yet been detected in the trials. Lower-dose regimens, as defined in the review, appeared to be as good as higher-dose regimens (eight trials, 1615 women). Very limited data were available in the included trials on time in labour and patient satisfaction. Few studies have addressed issues relating to the safety of using vaginal prostaglandins for induction of labour as outpatients."

There were no statistically significant differences in weight gain. In the cot-nursing group, fewer infants were breast fed on discharge (typical RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.14, three trials, 150 infants) and fewer infants died prior to hospital discharge (typical RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.25, four trials, 235 infants) but these results failed to reach statistical significance. The comparison of cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress versus incubator care, which included five trials and a total of 231 infants, produced similar results. Cot-nursing with warming of the nursery resulted in statistically significantly smaller weight gain during week one compared to the incubator group in one trial that involved 38 infants (MD -5.90 g/kg/day; 95% CI -11.13 to -0.67) but no significant difference was found for weeks two and three. Cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress has similar effects to incubator care with regard to temperature control and weight gain. Important clinical outcomes need to be investigated further using randomised controlled trials. This is especially the case in the situation of developing countries, where differences in these outcomes are likely to be encountered.

The control babies received routine care in an air heated incubator. One trial had three-arms, including cot-nursing in a room heated with a manually controlled space heater. In the included trials infants in the incubator groups were nursed naked apart from wearing a nappy, except in one trial in which the infants also wore a cotton jacket and booties. Three comparisons were undertaken: the overall comparison of cot-nursing versus incubator care, and two subgroup comparisons: cot-nursing with heated water-filled mattress versus incubator care, and cot-nursing using warming of the nursery versus incubator care. The results of the review showed no evidence of effect of cot-nursing versus incubator care on weight gain in the overall analysis, or in the subgroup analysis comparing cot-nursing using a heated water-filled mattress with incubator care. However, cot-nursing with warming of the nursery during week one when compared to incubator care revealed poorer weight gain. The primary outcomes related to temperature control (mean body temperature and episodes of cold stress) indicated on overall analysis no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. Episodes of hyperthermia in the cot-nursing group were reported more frequently in one trial. The secondary outcomes of oxygen consumption, breast feeding at hospital discharge, episodes of nosocomial sepsis, maternal perceptions of infant's condition, maternal stress and anxiety and death prior to hospital discharge revealed there was no effect of cot-nursing compared to incubator care. There was, however, a strong trend towards less death prior to hospital discharge. This was largely related to the results were obtained from the trials undertaken in Turkey and Ethiopia and thus may not be applicable to neonatal nurseries in developed countries. Nevertheless the implications of these findings deserve consideration, particularly in the context of a developing country."

Authors with Cochrane Oral Health found three relevant studies, involving 146 participants who had eye teeth displaced in the roof of the mouth, either on one or both sides. The majority of participants were female and the average age in the studies ranged from 14 to 17 years. Two studies were designed in a way that made them likely to be biased. We combined results from three studies and found that one technique did not seem to have an advantage over the other for ensuring the movement of the tooth into the correct position without the need for repeat surgery. Five out of 141 participants analysed were surgical failures, one of which was due to the complication of detachment of the gold chain during surgery. One study reported complications after surgery and found one participant in the closed group had a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and another participant in the closed group experienced pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate. We were unable to combine results from studies for any other outcomes, but individual studies did not show evidence of a difference between the two techniques for pain, discomfort, appearance, gum health, length of treatment time or cost (low to very low quality evidence). Overall, we assessed the quality of the evidence as low, which means we cannot be certain of the findings. It does not seem that one surgical technique is better than the other for moving displaced eye teeth into the correct position, or for other outcomes, but this finding is uncertain because the quality of the evidence is low. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three studies are currently in process. When they are completed, we will include them in an update of this review and may be able to reach firmer conclusions."

For endoscopy versus surgery, the quality of the evidence for pain relief, quality of life and pancreatic function was moderate (according to GRADE). For both complications and mortality this was low, since the two trials were too small to make reliable conclusions. The quality of evidence regarding surgery versus conservative treatment was low, since the trial was small, which precluded drawing reliable conclusions regarding all outcomes."

The trial had a high risk of bias. Neuropathy Impairment Scale scores after 12 weeks improved in 12 of 19 participants randomised to prednisone (A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from CORTISONE.), compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment (risk ratio (RR) for improvement 2.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.52; very low-quality evidence). The trial did not report side effects in detail, but one prednisone (A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from CORTISONE.)-treated participant died. A double-blind RCT comparing daily standard-dose oral prednisolone (A glucocorticoid with the general properties of the corticosteroids.) with monthly high-dose (Radiotherapy using radioactive particles that deposit a high amount of energy by radiation per unit length of travel.) oral dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.) in 40 participants reported none of the prespecified outcomes for this review. The trial had a low risk of bias, but the quality of evidence was limited as it came from a single small study. There was little or no difference in number of participants who achieved remission (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45 in favour of monthly dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.); moderate-quality evidence), or change in disability or impairment after one year (low-quality evidence). Change of grip strength or Medical Research Council (MRC) scores demonstrated little or no difference between groups (moderate-quality to low-quality evidence). Eight of 16 people in the prednisolone (A glucocorticoid with the general properties of the corticosteroids.) group and seven of 24 people in the dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.) group deteriorated. Side effects were similar with each regimen (A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.), except that sleeplessness (Difficulty in going to sleep or getting enough sleep.) was less common with monthly dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.) (low-quality evidence) as was moon facies (A constellation of signs and symptoms caused by an excess of glucocorticoids.) (moon-shaped appearance of the face) (moderate-quality evidence). Experience from large non-randomised studies suggests that corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) are beneficial, but long-term use causes serious side effects. We are very uncertain about the effects of oral prednisone (A synthetic anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid derived from CORTISONE.) compared with no treatment, because the quality of evidence from the only RCT that exists is very low. Nevertheless, corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) are commonly used in practice, supported by very low-quality evidence from observational studies. We also know from observational studies that corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) carry the long-term risk of serious side effects. The efficacy of high-dose (Radiotherapy using radioactive particles that deposit a high amount of energy by radiation per unit length of travel.) monthly oral dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.) is probably little different from that of daily standard-dose oral prednisolone (A glucocorticoid with the general properties of the corticosteroids.). Most side effects occurred with similar frequencies in both groups, but with high-dose (Radiotherapy using radioactive particles that deposit a high amount of energy by radiation per unit length of travel.) monthly oral dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.) moon facies (A constellation of signs and symptoms caused by an excess of glucocorticoids.) is probably less common and sleeplessness (Difficulty in going to sleep or getting enough sleep.) may be less common than with oral prednisolone (A glucocorticoid with the general properties of the corticosteroids.).

                "We found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) addressing each question. We did not find any new trials for this update. A 1982 US study compared daily prednisone tablets for 12 weeks with no treatment. Thirty-five people took part. Fourteen participants received prednisone (10 male and four female, with a median age of 46.5 years) and 14 did not receive prednisone (nine male and five female, with a median age of 50 years). Those taking part and the trialists were aware of which treatment the participants received (i.e. they were not 'blinded'), which carries a risk of bias. The second study compared two six-month corticosteroid treatment regimens: daily standard-dose prednisolone tablets, and high-dose dexamethasone tablets for four days each month. Multiple European centres did the trial, which reported its findings in 2010. Forty-one people took part but one person withdrew after one day because they did not want to continue and the diagnosis was wrong. Of those who continued, 24 (18 men and six women, average age 59.9 years) received monthly dexamethasone and 16 (10 men and six women, average age 60.8 years) received daily prednisolone. There was no commercial support for either study. Funding for both came from an academic centre or charitable funds. Neither included study reported our preferred primary outcome, which was a disability score. After 12 weeks, in the trial of prednisone compared to no treatment, 12 of 19 participants on prednisone improved compared with five of 16 participants not on prednisone, based on measurement of disease severity by neurologists. Thus, improvement was about twice as common with prednisone. The small numbers in the trial and its limitations meant that even with this difference we are very uncertain about the size of any effect of prednisone. The trial authors did not report side effects in detail, but one person who received prednisone died. Corticosteroids are commonly used for CIDP in practice, based on favourable reports from non-randomised studies. Corticosteroids are well known to cause side effects, especially when people take large doses for a long time. In the RCT comparing two corticosteroid regimens, 10 of 24 people on monthly dexamethasone and six of 16 people on daily prednisolone were well and off treatment after a year, which indicates effects that are probably similar. Changes in grip strength and scores of muscle strength were also probably similar between the treatment groups. Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone had similar side effects to one another, except that with high-dose monthly dexamethasone, sleeplessness may be less common and a moon-shaped facial appearance is probably less common. The benefit and harm from prednisone in CIDP is uncertain. The quality of evidence is very low because only one small randomised trial with a high risk of bias is available. Monthly dexamethasone and daily prednisolone may be of similar benefit in CIDP, but monthly dexamethasone may have fewer side effects. The evidence is up to date to 8 November 2016."

Baseline characteristics relating to asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) severity were variable, but studies generally recruited people with asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) taking regular medications (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) and excluded those with COPD (A disease of chronic diffuse irreversible airflow obstruction.) or severe asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.). One study compared the two types of check-up for oral steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) tapering in severe refractory asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) and we assessed it as a separate question. The studies could not be blinded and dropout was high in four of the six studies, which may have biased the results. We could not say whether more people who had a remote check-up needed oral corticosteroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.)s (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) for an asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) exacerbation than those who were seen face-to-face because the confidence intervals (CIs (A lesion with cytological characteristics associated with invasive carcinoma but the tumor cells are confined to the epithelium of origin, without invasion of the basement membrane.)) were very wide (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 7.44; 278 participants; one study; low quality evidence). In the face-to-face check-up groups, 21 participants out of 1000 had exacerbations that required oral steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.)s over three months, compared to 36 (95% CI nine to 139) out of 1000 for the remote check-up group. Exacerbations that needed treatment in the Emergency Department (ED (The inability in the male to have a PENILE ERECTION due to psychological or organ dysfunction.)), hospital admission or an unscheduled healthcare visit all happened too infrequently to detect whether remote check-ups are a safe alternative to face-to-face consultations. Serious adverse events were not reported separately from the exacerbation outcomes. There was no difference in asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) control measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or in quality of life measured on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) between remote and face-to-face check-ups. We could rule out significant harm of remote check-ups for these outcomes but we were less confident because these outcomes are more prone to bias from lack of blinding. The larger implementation study that compared two general practice populations demonstrated that offering telephone check-ups and proactively phoning participants increased the number of people with asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) who received a review. However, we do not know whether the additional participants who had a telephone check-up subsequently benefited in asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) outcomes. Current randomised evidence does not demonstrate any important differences between face-to-face and remote asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) check-ups in terms of exacerbations, asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) control or quality of life. There is insufficient information to rule out differences in efficacy, or to say whether or not remote asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) check-ups are a safe alternative to being seen face-to-face.",

People in the four pooled studies in general took regular medications and we excluded those with severe asthma or other lung diseases. We looked at two other studies with very different designs to the main four separately: one compared a practice where people with asthma were given the option of a telephone check-up or a practice visit where they came to the clinic as usual, and one looked specifically at using technology to monitor people while cutting down their oral steroids dose. We last looked for studies on 24 November 2015. We cannot say whether or not people who had a check-up over the phone or internet were more or less likely to need oral corticosteroids for an asthma attack than those seen face-to-face, and we were uncertain of the result for several reasons. Too few people had asthma attacks that needed treatment in the Emergency Department or hospital, or an unscheduled visit to see their doctor to tell if remote check-ups were as good as face-to-face consultations. There didn't appear to be a difference in asthma control or quality of life, but we were able to rule out the possibility that remote check-ups are not as good as face-to-face consultations on these measures. The evidence was all considered to be of low or moderate quality. The study that tested the possible benefit of giving people the option of a telephone check-up showed that this increased the number of people reviewed, but did not show an overall benefit on asthma outcomes."

What is exercise therapy and what is JIA? Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children and is an important cause of short-term and long-term disability. In JIA the cause of the arthritis is unknown. It generally begins in children younger than age 16 years. It always lasts for at least six weeks. A physician will rule out other conditions that may be causing the symptoms before diagnosing JIA. Several types of exercise therapy are described in this review, for example, physical training programs such as strength training for improving muscle strength and endurance exercise for improving overall fitness (either land based or in a pool). Best estimate of what happens to children with JIA and exercise Ability to function: a child's ability to function changed less than 1 more point on a scale of 0 to 3. Other studies state that a change of 0.13 on the score of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) is a clinically important improvement from the perspective of children and their parents. This level of change has not been found in this review Quality of life: a child's quality of life changed between 2.5 and 4 more points on a scale of 1 to 50. There may be little or no difference with exercise. It is possible that these differences are the result of chance.

We found 19 randomised studies that compared antibiotics versus placebo in a total of 2663 COPD patients with a wide range of flare-up severity. Analyses show that currently used antibiotics reduced treatment failures (no improvement in symptoms, despite treatment, within 7 to 28 days, depending on the study) compared with placebo in outpatients with mild to moderate flare-ups, as well as in patients admitted to an intensive care unit for very severe flare-ups with respiratory failure. However, antibiotics did not reduce treatment failures among hospitalised patients with severe flare-ups, although we are less certain about this result because the effect estimate also suggested findings similar to those seen in outpatients, but the confidence interval crossed 1.0. Use of antibiotics led to reduced mortality only in patients admitted to an intensive care unit, but not in patients with mild to moderate (outpatients) or severe (inpatients) flare-ups, although deaths were rare in these latter groups. Antibiotics did not reduce length of hospital stay for hospitalised patients. Patients treated with antibiotics experienced diarrhoea more often than those given placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant. Reviewers could not compare the severity of underlying COPD across trials because trial authors inconsistently reported lung function and other parameters. The quality of evidence for review outcomes was low to moderate. Although trial results show that antibiotics were effective across outcomes for patients with very severe flare-ups and respiratory failure who needed treatment in an intensive care unit, researchers report inconsistent effects in patients with mild to severe flare-ups. Future high-quality studies should examine clinical signs or blood tests at the time of presentation that are useful for identifying patients who can benefit from antibiotic therapy."

Two out of three trials which measured urinary outcomes (urodynamics, frequency and bother of symptoms, or symptom score (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)) reported differences between groups in favour of the PFMT group.

Four trials compared pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with no intervention, and two trials compared pelvic floor muscle training plus surgery to surgery alone. PFMT compared to no intervention was found in individual trials to improve prolapse symptoms, but data could not be combined. Data on prolapse severity was combined from two trials and results indicated that PFMT increases the chance of improvement in prolapse stage by 17% compared to no treatment. Pelvic floor muscle function appeared to be improved in women who received PFMT in the two trials which measured this. Bladder symptoms were improved with PFMT in two out of three trials measuring this; bowel symptoms were measured in one trial, and an improvement with PFMT was found. The two trials which looked at the benefit of PFMT in addition to surgery, were small but of good quality. Findings were contradictory: women benefited from PFMT, in terms of urinary symptoms and pelvic floor muscle strength, in one trial but not the other. The evidence from the trials suggests there is some benefit from conservative treatment of prolapse, specifically for PFMT as compared to no intervention. More randomised controlled trials are still needed to look at different regimens of PFMT, the cost in relation to benefit, and the long-term effects. The combination of PFMT and surgery requires to be evaluated in a large randomised trial. There is a dearth of trials addressing lifestyle changes as a treatment for prolapse, and trials aimed at prevention of prolapse.

In sixteen studies, FRS (A benzoic-sulfonamide-furan.) differentiated schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.) from other types of psychosis (a loss of ego boundaries or a gross impairment in reality testing with delusions or prominent hallucinations.) with a sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) of 58% (50.3% to 65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%). The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS (A benzoic-sulfonamide-furan.) correctly identifies people with schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.) 75% to 95% of the time.

These people will still merit specialist assessment and help due to the severity of disturbance in their behaviour and mental state. Again, with a sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) of FRS (A benzoic-sulfonamide-furan.) of 60%, reliance on FRS (A benzoic-sulfonamide-furan.) to diagnose (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.) in triage (The sorting out and classification of patients or casualties to determine priority of need and proper place of treatment.) will not correctly diagnose (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) around 40% of people that specialists will consider to have schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.). Some of these people may experience a delay in getting appropriate treatment. Others, whom specialists will consider to have schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.), could be prematurely discharged from care, if triage (The sorting out and classification of patients or casualties to determine priority of need and proper place of treatment.) relies on the presence of FRS (A benzoic-sulfonamide-furan.) to diagnose (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.). Empathetic, considerate use of FRS (A benzoic-sulfonamide-furan.) as a diagnostic (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) aid - with known limitations - should avoid a good proportion of these errors. We hope that newer tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) - to be included in future Cochrane reviews - will show better results. However, symptoms of first rank (encoded by the human TNFRSF11A gene.) can still be helpful where newer tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) are not available - a situation which applies to the initial screening (Procedures performed on people to identify those who have NEOPLASMS or PRENEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS.) of most people with suspected schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.).

                "This review looks at how accurate First Rank Symptoms (FRS) are at diagnosing schizophrenia. FRS are symptoms that people with psychosis may experience, for example hallucinations, hearing voices and thinking that other people can hear their thoughts. We found 21 studies, with 6253 participants, that looked at how good FRS are at diagnosing schizophrenia when compared to a diagnosis made by a psychiatrist. These studies showed that for people who actually have schizophrenia, FRS would only correctly diagnose just over half of them as schizophrenic. For people who do not have schizophrenia, almost 20% would be incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. Therefore, if a person is experiencing a FRS, schizophrenia is a possible diagnosis, but there is also a chance that it is another mental health disorder. We do not recommend that FRS alone can be used to diagnose schizophrenia. However, FRS could be useful to triage patients who need to be assessed by a psychiatrist."

There were 2003 participants in the 9 educational intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s (intended to prevent disease or alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.) and 44 participants in the 1 psychological study. Some included studies had methodological weaknesses (The property of lacking physical strength.); for example, we judged four studies to have high risk of detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) bias, attrition bias, or other bias. Our primary outcomes were participant-rated global assessment, reduction in disease severity (reported as objective SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for pruritus.))), and improvement in sleep and quality of life. No study reported participant-rated global assessment or improvement of sleep. The largest and most robust study (n = 992) demonstrated significant reduction in disease severity and improvement in quality of life, in both nurse- and dermatologist-led intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) groups. It provided six standardised, age-appropriate group education sessions. Statistically significant improvements in objective severity using the SCORAD clinical tool were recorded for all intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) groups when compared with controls. Improvements in objective severity (intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) minus no intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)) by age group were as follows: age 3 months to 7 years = 4.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 6.8; age 8 to 12 years = 6.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 11.2; and age 13 to 18 years = 9.9, 95% CI 4.3 to 15.5. In three of five studies, which could not be combined because of their heterogeneity, the objective SCORAD measure was statistically significantly better in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group compared with the usual care groups. However, in all of the above studies, the confidence interval limits do not exceed the minimum clinically important difference of 8.2 for objective SCORAD. The largest study measured quality of life using the German 'Quality of life in parents of children with atopic dermatitis' questionnaire, a validated tool with five subscales. Parents of children under seven years had significantly better improvements in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group on all five subscales. Parents of children aged 8 to 12 years experienced significantly better improvements in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group on 3 of the 5 subscales. This update has incorporated five new RCTs using educational intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s (intended to prevent disease or alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.) as an adjunct to conventional treatment for children with atopic eczema (A pruritic papulovesicular dermatitis occurring as a reaction to many endogenous and exogenous agents (Dorland, 27th ed).) (A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for pruritus.). We did not identify any further studies using psychological intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. The inclusion of new studies has not substantially altered the conclusions from the original review. The educational studies in both the original review and this update lack detail about intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) design and do not use a complex intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s framework. Few use an explicit theoretical base, and the components of each intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) are not sufficiently well described to allow replication. A relative lack of rigorously designed trials provides limited evidence of the effectiveness of educational and psychological intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s in helping to manage the condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) of atopic eczema (A pruritic papulovesicular dermatitis occurring as a reaction to many endogenous and exogenous agents (Dorland, 27th ed).) (A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for pruritus.) in children. However, there is some evidence from included paediatric studies using different educational intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) delivery models (multiprofessional eczema (A pruritic papulovesicular dermatitis occurring as a reaction to many endogenous and exogenous agents (Dorland, 27th ed).) intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s and nurse-led clinics) that these may lead to improvements in disease severity and quality of life. Educational and psychological intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s require further development using a complex intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s framework. Comparative evaluation is needed to examine their impact on eczema (A pruritic papulovesicular dermatitis occurring as a reaction to many endogenous and exogenous agents (Dorland, 27th ed).) severity, quality of life, psychological distress (Negative emotional state characterized by physical and/or emotional discomfort, pain, or anguish.), and cost-effectiveness. There is also a need for comparison of educational intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s (intended to prevent disease or alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.) with stand-alone psychosocial self-help.",

                "The main finding of this review is that there is currently only limited research evidence about the effect of educational and psychological approaches when used alongside medicines for the treatment of childhood eczema. Included studies provided a range of interventions, from a single 15-minute consultation to a comprehensive series of sessions delivered to groups of parents over a period of 12 hours. Details of the interventions used and the educational theory base are generally poorly described. Outcome measures varied between studies. Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions from this review, several studies using educational interventions demonstrated improvements in eczema severity and quality of life for both children and families. In particular, two studies showed promise. One large study (n = 992) using a multi-disciplinary group education intervention in a hospital setting showed modest improvements in disease severity and quality of life. The single study using psychological approaches indicated that relaxation methods reduced the severity of eczema when compared to discussion only. There is a need for further research into this subject, and priority should be given to comparing the relative cost effectiveness of health professionals educating parents either in teams or by nurses alone. There is also a need for comparison with stand-alone self-help. The most appropriate timeframe for evaluating the effect of interventions should be considered."

                "Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, they help people cope with symptoms such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. Guidelines state that there is no difference in effectiveness between antipsychotics, but low-potency antipsychotic drugs are often seen as less effective than high-potency drugs, and they also seem to differ in side-effects. The classification into high-potency and low-potency medication means that low-potency antipsychotic drugs need higher doses for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Side-effects that are common to most high-potency antipsychotic drugs include the movement disorders such as uncontrollable movements of the face, arms, or legs; tremors; problems with balance or walking; restlessness; seizures; joint pain whereas low-potency drugs are more likely to cause sedation, fever and loss of muscle strength. Research has not evaluated and compared high-potency drugs with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. The aim of the review was therefore to compare trifluoperazine (a high-potency antipsychotic) with low-potency antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia. Examples of low-potency drugs are chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and levomepromazine.\u00a0The review is based on a search carried out in 2010 and included seven studies with a total of 422 people.\u00a0It compared trifluoperazine with low-potency antipsychotic drugs. Overall, information was poorly reported and the quality of the studies was low; authors rated the quality of evidence for the main outcomes of interested as being either moderate, low or very low quality.\u00a0Results do not show a superiority of trifluoperazine compared with low-potency antipsychotics.\u00a0However, at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness) was significantly more with trifluoperazine. For people with schizophrenia it is important to know that trifluoperazine and low-potency antipsychotics are approximately equal for dealing with symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things.\u00a0They differ slightly in their side-effects, with trifluoperazine leading to at least one movement disorder (muscle stiffness). However, no clear superiority of trifluoperazine versus low-potency antipsychotics was found.\u00a0Due to the limited number of studies, participants and low quality of information, these results have to be interpreted with caution.

We found nine eligible randomised controlled trials (including a total of 593 infants) that examined whether feeding preterm infants in response to their own feeding and satiation cues (sometimes called 'demand' feeding) is better than feeding set volumes of milk at predefined intervals. These trials compared responsive with scheduled interval regimens in preterm infants in the transition phase from intragastric tube to oral feeding. Although the trials were generally small and most had some methodological weaknesses, analysis suggests that responsive feeding results in slightly slower rates of weight gain and reduces the time taken for infants to transition from enteral tube to oral feeding. The quality of this evidence is low, and the importance of this finding is uncertain as the trials did not find a strong or consistent effect on the length of hospitalisation. None of the included trials reported any parent, caregiver, or staff views. This Cochrane review does not provide strong or consistent evidence that responsive feeding improves outcomes for preterm infants or their families. Responsive feeding might help infants transition more quickly to oral feeding, but more randomised controlled trials would be needed to confirm this finding."

It is also possible that zinc deficiency may affect infant growth as well. This review of 21 randomised controlled trials, involving over 17,000 women and their babies, found that although zinc supplementation has a small effect on reducing preterm births, it does not help to prevent low birthweight babies compared with not giving zinc supplements before 27 weeks of pregnancy. One trial did not contribute data. The overall risk of bias was unclear in half of the studies. No clear differences were seen for development of pregnancy hypertension or pre-eclampsia. The 14% relative reduction in preterm birth for zinc compared with placebo was primarily represented by trials of women with low incomes. In some trials all women were also given iron, folate or vitamins or combinations of these. UNICEF is already promoting antenatal use of multiple-micronutrient supplementation, including zinc, to all pregnant women in developing countries. Finding ways to improve women's overall nutritional status, particularly in low-income areas, will do more to improve the health of mothers and babies than supplementing pregnant women with zinc alone. In low- to middle- income countries, addressing anaemia and infections, such as malaria and hookworm, is also necessary."

The findings of this review indicate that CPAP (A form of non-invasive mechanical pressure support ventilation that uses a continuous positive airway pressure level to support spontaneous breathing activity.) or bilevel NPPV is an effective and safe intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) for the treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment of adults with acute respiratory failure (Life-threatening respiratory failure that develops rapidly.) after upper abdominal surgery.

                "We searched scientific databases for clinical trials looking at the treatment of adults with acute respiratory failure following abdominal surgery. The trials compared NPPV with usual care(oxygen therapy through a face mask). We included two trials involving 269 participants.The participants were mostly men (67%) and on average 65 years of age. One trial was conducted in several intensive care units (ICU). Both trials included adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to May 2015. This review examined mortality, rate of tracheal intubation, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, complications after NPPV, and changes in the levels of gases within the blood (arterial blood gases). Compared with oxygen therapy, NPPV decreased the rate of tracheal intubation. Out of every 1000 adults who developed acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery, 181 adults treated with oxygen therapy would need to be intubated compared with 54 adults treated with NPPV. When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV tended to reduce mortality. However, since the number of participants included in the two trials was small, more studies are needed. The use of NPPV also reduced the length of stay in the ICU by almost two days when compared to oxygen therapy. However, the mean length of stay in the hospital was similar in the two groups. When compared to oxygen therapy, NPPV improved blood gas levels one hour after the intervention. There was insufficient evidence to be certain that CPAP or NPPV had an effect on anastomotic (e.g. where two pieces of intestine are joined together) leakage, pneumonia related complications and sepsis (blood poisoning) or infections. However, adults treated with NPPV had lower rates these complications than adults treated with oxygen. There was low quality evidence for hospital mortality, low quality of evidence for rate of tracheal intubation, and very low quality of evidence for ICU length of stay. The findings of this review showed that NPPV is an effective and safe treatment for adults with acute respiratory failure after upper abdominal surgery. However, due to the low quality of the evidence, more good quality studies are needed to confirm these findings."

Pooled data from two trials of interferon beta-1a (glycosylated at position 80.)

Seven trials compared treatments with placebo (inactive treatment): three of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), two of interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a), and one each of oxandrolone, methotrexate (MTX), and arimoclomol (not yet published). A further two trials compared MTX with combined immunosuppressive therapy (MTX with anti-T lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) (an agent that destroys white blood cells) and MTX with azathioprine). In these two trials, participants and investigators knew which treatment participants were receiving, which could have biased the results. For our primary outcome, which was muscle strength, we were only able to combine the results for the two trials of IFN beta-1a therapy versus placebo. This treatment did not appear to offer a benefit in terms of muscle strength. MTX also did not stop or retard loss of muscle strength when compared to placebo. We considered the evidence from these trials to be of moderate quality because the trials were too small to rule out a possible benefit for these drugs. For the other trials, the evidence was of very low quality. Three trials compared IVIg (combined in one trial with prednisone) to a placebo, but we were unable to perform meta-analysis because the available data were not suitable. One trial of ATG combined with MTX versus MTX alone provided very low-quality evidence of an effect on muscle strength in favour of MTX plus ATG at 12 months. The other comparisons, of MTX versus placebo, oxandrolone versus placebo, azathioprine combined with MTX versus MTX, and arimoclomol versus placebo were reported in single trials that did not provide enough data for analysis of the effect on muscle strength. Due to their small size and short duration, the trials we studied were generally unable to give definitive answers as to whether the treatments tested were effective or ineffective. All of the interventions we studied had some adverse effects and are known to cause potentially serious adverse events. We need larger trials of longer duration, using robust ways of measuring the effects of treatments that are meaningful to people with IBM. Agreeing on common trial measurements will also make it easier to compare trial results and assess potential treatments. The evidence is current to October 2014."

The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the five studies was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.70 to 1.16). For the five RCTs that reported death and severe disability (unfavourable outcome), the pooled OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.18). In the two RCTs which reported the risk of death in a subgroup of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) patients, the pooled OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.94). Three RCTs reported death and severe disability as an outcome in this subgroup, and the pooled OR 0.67 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.98). This systematic review of randomised controlled trials of calcium channel blockers (A class of drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.)s that act by selective inhibition of calcium influx through cellular membranes.) in acute traumatic head injury patients shows that considerable uncertainty remains over their effects. The effect of nimodipine (A calcium channel blockader with preferential cerebrovascular activity.) in a subgroup of brain injury patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) shows a beneficial effect, though the increase in adverse reactions (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) or other therapy.) suffered by the intervention group may mean that the drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) is harmful for some patients.",

The authors also looked at trials involving patients suffering from subarachnoid haemorrhage (that is, bleeding into the space between the brain and the skull) caused by an injury, as a subgroup. The authors found six eligible trials involving 1862 patients. The results indicate that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of calcium channel blockers. The authors conclude that there is some evidence that a calcium channel blocker called nimodipine may be beneficial for some patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. However, there is also an indication of certain adverse reactions amongst patients treated with nimodipine which may mean that the drug is harmful for some individuals. The authors recommend that the promising results in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage are replicated in a larger well designed trial, before any firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the drug can be drawn. In future trials, data on outcomes other than death and severe disability, such as quality of life of the survivors and the economic utility of the drug, should be measured; such outcomes have not been considered in existing research."

All three trials examined the treatment of symptomatic in-stent restenosis within the femoropopliteal arteries (The continuation of the femoral artery coursing through the popliteal fossa; it divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries.). These trials were carried out in Germany and Austria and used paclitaxel (A cyclodecane isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, TAXUS BREVIFOLIA.) as the agent in the drug-eluting balloons. Two of the three trials were industry sponsored. Two companies manufactured the drug-eluting balloons (Eurocor, Bonn, Germany; Medtronic, Fridley, Minnesota, USA). The trials examined both anatomical and clinical endpoints. We noted heterogeneity in the frequency of bailout stenting deployment between studies as well as in the dosage of paclitaxel (A cyclodecane isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, TAXUS BREVIFOLIA.) applied by the DEBs. Using GRADE assessment criteria, we determined that the certainty of evidence presented was very low for the outcomes of amputation (The removal of a limb or other appendage or outgrowth of the body.), target lesion revascularization (procedures performed on the blood vessels with the intent of restoring the circulation or integrity of the blood vessels and to improve circulation deficiencies due to disease, injuries, or deformities.), binary restenosis (recurrent stenosis; occurs usually after corrective surgery to the orifice of a heart valve.), death, and improvement of one or more Rutherford categories. Most participants were followed up to 12 months, but one trial followed participants for up to 24 months. Trial results show no difference in the incidence of amputation (The removal of a limb or other appendage or outgrowth of the body.) between DEBs and uncoated balloon angioplasty (Use of a balloon catheter for dilation of an occluded artery.). DEBs showed better outcomes for up to 24 months for target lesion revascularization (procedures performed on the blood vessels with the intent of restoring the circulation or integrity of the blood vessels and to improve circulation deficiencies due to disease, injuries, or deformities.)

Based on a meta-analysis of three trials with 263 participants, evidence suggests an advantage for DEBs compared with uncoated balloon angioplasty (Use of a balloon catheter for dilation of an occluded artery.) for anatomical endpoints such as target lesion revascularization (procedures performed on the blood vessels with the intent of restoring the circulation or integrity of the blood vessels and to improve circulation deficiencies due to disease, injuries, or deformities.)

However, the certainty of evidence for all these outcomes is very low due to the small number of included studies and participants and the high risk of bias in study design.

Most study participants were followed for six or more months; this is called \"follow-up.\" Results showed that DEBs were not better for participants than uncoated balloon angioplasty with regard to the need for amputation. At 24 months of follow-up, DEBs were associated with fewer target lesion revascularizations, which refers to the need to perform a procedure on a stent that had already been treated with a DEB or an uncoated balloon angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. DEBs were also found to have better binary restenosis rates, which refers to the percentage of treated stents that develop new stenosis after they have been treated with a DEB or an uncoated balloon angioplasty. Finally, more people who were treated with DEBs described improvement in their leg symptoms, as measured by a change in their Rutherford category. DEBs were not found to be better for participants than uncoated balloon angioplasty with regard to patient death. The certainty of the evidence presented was very low because we identified only three studies with small numbers of participants, and because many participants in those studies were lost to follow-up. Furthermore, risk of performance and attrition bias was significant, as was risk of other biases, due to lack of accounting for the type of stent treated and the need for bailout stenting."

Evidence was considered high quality for the incidence of serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.), mortality and time for laboratory parameters to normalise. Evidence was considered moderate for the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities due to potential inconsistencies in data geography and patient benefits according to grouping. Evidence was moderate for duration of clinical symptoms (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) (fever (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.), rash (Diseases in which skin eruptions or rashes are a prominent manifestation.)) due to potential subjectivity in measurement. Evidence was moderate for length of hospital stay as only one study recorded this outcome. This means that we are reasonably confident that the true effect is close to that estimated in this work.

Although the findings of the current review suggest that PIP is a promising model in terms of improving infant attachment (The act or operation of holding, suturing, or fastening in a fixed position.) security in high-risk families, there were no significant differences compared with no treatment or treatment-as-usual for other parent-based or relationship-based outcomes, and no evidence that PIP is more effective than other methods of working with parents and infants. Further rigorous research is needed to establish the impact of PIP on potentially important mediating factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.) such as parental mental health, reflective functioning, and parent-infant interaction.",

                "We searched electronic databases and identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs, where participants are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) and one cluster randomised trial (where prisons rather than participants were used as the unit of randomisation), in which participants had been allocated to a receive PIP versus a control group, and which reported results using at least one standard measure of outcome (i.e. an instrument which has been tested to ensure that it reliably measures the outcome under investigation). Evidence is current to 13 January 2014. We identified eight studies with 846 randomised participants comparing either PIP with a no-treatment control group (four studies) or comparing PIP with other types of treatment (four studies). The studies comparing PIP with a no-treatment control group contributed data to 19 meta-analyses of the primary outcomes of parental mental health (depression), parent-infant interaction outcomes of maternal sensitivity (i.e. the extent to which the caregiver responds in a timely and attuned manner), child involvement and parent positive engagement, and infant outcomes of infant attachment category (the infant's ability to seek and maintain closeness to primary caregiver - infant attachment is classified as follows: 'secure' infant attachment is a positive outcome, which indicates that the infant is able to be comforted when distressed and is able to use the parent as a secure base from which to explore the environment. Infants who are insecurely attached are either 'avoidant' (i.e. appear not to need comforting when they are distressed and attempt to manage the distress themselves); or 'resistant' (i.e. unable to be comforted when distressed and alternate between resistance and anger). Children who are defined as \u2018disorganised\u2019 are unable to produce a coherent strategy in the face of distress and produce behaviour that is a mixture of approach and avoidance to the caregiver); and the secondary outcomes of infant behaviour and infant cognitive development (i.e. intellectual development, including thinking, problem solving and communicating). In our analyses, parents who received PIP were more likely to have an infant who was securely emotionally attached to the parent after the intervention; this a favourable outcome but there is very low quality evidence to support it. The studies comparing PIP with another model of treatment contributed data to 15 meta-analysis assessments of primary outcomes, including parental mental health, parent-infant interaction (maternal sensitivity); infant attachment and infant behaviour, or secondary infant outcomes such as infant cognitive development. None of these comparisons showed differences that favoured either PIP or the alternative intervention. None of the comparisons of PIP with either a control or comparison treatment group showed adverse changes for any outcome. We conclude that although PIP appears to be a promising method of improving infant attachment security, there is no evidence about its benefits in terms of other outcomes, and no evidence to show that it is more effective than other types of treatment for parents and infants. Further research is needed. The included studies were unclear about important quality criteria, had limitations in terms of their design or methods, or we judged that there was risk of bias in the trial. This lower quality evidence gives us less confidence in the observed effects."

The studies compared maternal (mother) and neonatal (foetal) outcomes when pregnant women received extra oxygen versus room air. Oxygen was given to the women in different ways (at any flow rate or concentration via any oxygen delivery device). Overall, the results of this updated review reach the same conclusions as the original published review. None of the 11 included trials reported maternal desaturation. No differences were noted in routine measures of foetal wellbeing (Apgar scores) when mothers who received extra oxygen were compared with those who did not. The pregnant women receiving extra oxygen in comparison with room air had significantly higher oxygen saturation (three trials) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (five trials), as well as a significantly higher partial pressure of oxygen in both the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein (eight and 11 trials, respectively). Two trials reported higher markers of free radicals (perhaps indicating stress from excess oxygen) in mothers and foetuses when extra oxygen was given, but this is of no clinical significance Overall, we found no convincing evidence that giving oxygen in this situation is either beneficial or harmful for either the mother or the foetus. None of the 11 studies focused on maternal changes in oxygen saturation (defined as maternal saturation less than 90%). We graded the quality of evidence as low for the primary outcome (Apgar scores), and very low for the secondary outcomes (maternal oxygen saturation; partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, the umbilical artery and the umbilical vein). The reasons for our grading were risk of bias and inconsistency of the results."

In total, we included 61 studies; 46 for prevalence, six for both prevalence and risk factors, and nine not meeting the inclusion criteria, but assessing risk factors. The 52 studies evaluating the prevalence of renal dysfunction (Diminished kidney function.) included 13,327 participants of interest, of whom at least 4499 underwent renal function testing (Laboratory tests used to evaluate how well the kidneys are working through examination of blood and urine.). The prevalence of adverse renal effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity of included malignancies (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.), received treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.), reported outcome measures, follow-up duration and the methodological quality of available evidence. Seven out of 52 studies, including 244 participants, reported the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (Impairment of the renal function secondary to chronic kidney damage persisting for three or more months.), which ranged from 2.4% to 32%. Of these 52 studies, 36 studied a decreased (estimated) GFR (The volume of water filtered out of plasma through glomerular capillary walls into Bowman's capsules per unit of time.), including at least 432 CCS, and found it was present in 0% to 73.7% of participants. One eligible study reported an increased risk of glomerular dysfunction after concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides (an amino substituent on the glycoside.) and vancomycin (Antibacterial obtained from Streptomyces orientalis.) in CCS receiving total body irradiation (Irradiation of the whole body with ionizing or non-ionizing radiation.) (TBI (Irradiation of the whole body with ionizing or non-ionizing radiation.)). Four non-eligible studies assessing a total cohort of CCS, found nephrectomy (Excision of kidney.) and (high-dose (Radiotherapy using radioactive particles that deposit a high amount of energy by radiation per unit length of travel.) (HD (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.))) ifosfamide (active as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent.) as risk factors for decreased GFR (The volume of water filtered out of plasma through glomerular capillary walls into Bowman's capsules per unit of time.). The majority also reported cisplatin (An inorganic and water-soluble platinum complex.) as a risk factor. In addition, two non-eligible studies showed an association of a longer follow-up period with glomerular dysfunction. Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, studied proteinuria, which was present in 3.5% to 84% of participants. Risk factors, analysed by three non-eligible studies, included HD (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) cisplatin (An inorganic and water-soluble platinum complex.), (HD (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.)) ifosfamide (active as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent.), TBI (Irradiation of the whole body with ionizing or non-ionizing radiation.), and a combination of nephrectomy (Excision of kidney.) and abdominal radiotherapy. However, studies were contradictory and incomparable. Eleven out of 52 studies assessed hypophosphataemia (A condition of an abnormally low level of PHOSPHATES in the blood.) or tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR (encoded by the human TPR gene.)), or both. Prevalence ranged between 0% and 36.8% for hypophosphataemia (A condition of an abnormally low level of PHOSPHATES in the blood.) in 287 participants, and from 0% to 62.5% for impaired TPR (encoded by the human TPR gene.) in 246 participants. One non-eligible study investigated risk factors for hypophosphataemia (A condition of an abnormally low level of PHOSPHATES in the blood.), but could not find any association. Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, assessed the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia (Lower than normal levels of magnesium in the circulating blood.), which ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%. Both non-eligible studies investigating risk factors identified cisplatin (An inorganic and water-soluble platinum complex.) as a risk factor. Carboplatin (An organoplatinum compound that possesses antineoplastic activity.), nephrectomy (Excision of kidney.) and follow-up time were other reported risk factors. The prevalence of hypertension (Persistently high systemic arterial BLOOD PRESSURE.) ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies). Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening (Procedures performed on people to identify those who have NEOPLASMS or PRENEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS.) and abdominal radiotherapy. A non-eligible study also found long follow-up time as risk factor. Three non-eligible studies showed that a higher body mass index increased the risk of hypertension (Persistently high systemic arterial BLOOD PRESSURE.). Treatment-related risk factors were abdominal radiotherapy and TBI (Irradiation of the whole body with ionizing or non-ionizing radiation.), but studies were inconsistent. Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. Risk of bias was present in all studies. The prevalence of adverse renal effects after treatment with cisplatin (An inorganic and water-soluble platinum complex.), carboplatin (An organoplatinum compound that possesses antineoplastic activity.), ifosfamide (active as an alkylating agent and an immunosuppressive agent.), radiation therapy involving the kidney region, nephrectomy (Excision of kidney.), or any combination of these, ranged from 0% to 84% depending on the study population, received treatment combination, reported outcome measure, follow-up duration and methodological quality. With currently available evidence, it was not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the prevalence of, and treatment-related risk factors for, specific adverse renal effects. Future studies should focus on adequate study designs and reporting, including large prospective cohort studies with adequate control groups when possible. In addition, these studies should deploy multivariable risk factor analyses to correct for possible confounding. Next to research concerning known nephrotoxic therapies, exploring nephrotoxicity after new therapeutic agents is advised for future studies. Until more evidence becomes available, CCS should preferably be enrolled into long-term follow-up programmes to monitor their renal function and blood pressure.",

The studies took place at least one year after the participants had finished their treatment. The 52 studies that evaluated prevalence of adverse kidney effects included 13,327 participants, of whom 4499 underwent kidney function tests.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease ranged from 2.4% to 32% in 244 participants (7/52 studies). Thirty-six out of 52 studies, including at least 432 participants, carried out a kidney function test called glomerular filtration rate (GFR). An abnormal GFR was found to be present in 0% to 73.7% of participants. One eligible study found an increased risk of abnormal GFR in participants who had been treated with total body irradiation (TBI) and received certain types of antibiotics (aminoglycosides and vancomycin). Four non-eligible studies reported an increased risk of abnormal GFR for participants treated with surgery of the kidney and ifosfamide. Some studies also reported that cisplatin and long follow-up duration were risk factors. Twenty-two out of 52 studies, including 851 participants, assessed an abnormal amount of proteins in the urine, which they found in 3.5% to 84% of participants. Risk factors, evaluated by three non-eligible studies, included cisplatin, ifosfamide, TBI, and a combination of surgery and radiation involving the kidney. However, the results of these studies did not agree, and we could not analyse their results together because they used different definitions. Eleven out of 52 studies looked at a low level of phosphate in the blood (hypophosphataemia), or problems with the reabsorption of phosphate by the kidneys in 246 participants. Prevalence of hypophosphataemia ranged between 0% and 36.8% in 287 participants. The studies found problems with the reabsorption of phosphate by the kidneys in 0% to 62.5% of participants. One non-eligible study investigated risk factors, but could not find any association with hypophosphataemia. Four out of 52 studies, including 128 CCS, evaluated a low level of magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesaemia). Prevalence ranged between 13.2% and 28.6%. Two non-eligible studies identified cisplatin as risk factor for hypomagnesaemia. Other reported risk factors were carboplatin, surgery of the kidney, and follow-up time. However, studies were contradictory. The prevalence of high blood pressure ranged from 0% to 50% in 2464 participants (30/52 studies). Risk factors reported by one eligible study were older age at screening and radiation involving the kidney. A high body mass index was reported as a risk factor by three non-eligible studies. Other reported risk factors included follow-up time, and radiation involving the kidney or TBI. However, studies were contradictory. All studies showed problems that could affect our confidence in their results.

Two trials compared standard treatment (chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) plus radiotherapy) with PET-adapted therapy (chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) only) in individuals with early-stage HL (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) and negative PET scan (An imaging technique using compounds labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides (such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18) to measure cell metabolism.)s. The study design of the third trial was more complex. Participants with early-stage HL (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) were divided into those with a favourable or unfavourable prognosis. They were then randomised to receive PET-adapted or standard treatment. Following a PET scan (An imaging technique using compounds labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides (such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18) to measure cell metabolism.), participants were further divided into PET-positive and PET-negative groups (A soft tissue sarcoma that usually occurs in the limbs, most commonly the legs, and may also occur in the abdomen.). To date, data have been published for the PET-negative arms only, making it possible to perform a meta-analysis including all three trials. Of the 1999 participants included in the three trials only 1480 were analysed. The 519 excluded participants were either PET-positive, or were excluded because they did not match the inclusion criteria. One study reported no deaths. The other two studies reported two deaths in participants receiving PET-adapted therapy and two in participants receiving standard therapy (very-low-quality evidence). Progression-free survival was shorter in participants with PET-adapted therapy (without radiotherapy) than in those receiving standard treatment with radiotherapy (HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.62 to 3.50; P value < 0.0001). This difference was also apparent in comparisons of participants receiving no additional radiotherapy (PET-adapted therapy) versus radiotherapy (standard therapy) (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.23; P value = 0.03) and in those receiving chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) but no radiotherapy (PET-adapted therapy) versus standard radiotherapy (HR 3.00; 95% CI 1.75 to 5.14; P value < 0.0001) (moderate-quality evidence). Short-term AEs only were assessed in one trial, which showed no evidence of a difference between the treatment arms (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.53; P value = 0.72) (very-low-quality evidence). No data on long-term AEs were reported in any of the trials. To date, no robust data on OS, response rate, TRM, QoL (The overall enjoyment of life.), or short- and long-term AEs are available. However, this systematic review found moderate-quality evidence that PFS was shorter in individuals with early-stage HL (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.) and a negative PET scan (An imaging technique using compounds labelled with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides (such as carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15 and fluorine-18) to measure cell metabolism.) receiving chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) only (PET-adapted therapy) than in those receiving additional radiotherapy (standard therapy). More RCTs with longer follow ups (A soft tissue sarcoma that usually occurs in the limbs, most commonly the legs, and may also occur in the abdomen.) may lead to more precise results for AEs, TRM and QoL (The overall enjoyment of life.), and could evaluate whether this PFS advantage will translate into an overall survival benefit. It is still uncertain whether PET-positive individuals benefit from PET-based treatment adaptation and the effect of such an approach in those with advanced HL (A malignant disease characterized by progressive enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, and general lymphoid tissue.).",

                "We searched important medical databases such as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and MEDLINE. Two review authors independently screened, summarised and analysed the results. This lead to the inclusion of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 1999 participants. Currently, only data for 1480 of these participants have been published and were included in this systematic review. Participants were randomised to receive either standard therapy (chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy) or PET-adapted therapy (chemotherapy only). The median age of participants was 32 years and 52% were male. The evidence provided is current to September 2014. We are unable to draw conclusions about the effect of PET-adapted therapy on OS as there was insufficient data available (4 deaths in 1480 participants). However, PFS was shorter following PET-adapted therapy than with standard treatment. Based on our data, we can assume that of 1000 individuals receiving PET-adapted treatment over 4 years, 222 individuals would experience disease progression or death compared with 100 of 1000 individuals receiving standard treatment. Only one trial reported on short-term adverse events and the findings were uncertain and do not provide reliable evidence. The studies did not provide any information on the outcomes of QoL, response to therapy or treatment-related mortality. We judged the quality of evidence for the outcomes of OS and adverse events as very low. We considered the quality of evidence for PFS to be moderate. To date, no robust data on OS are available. This systematic review shows that individuals with early-stage HL have a shorter PFS after PET-adapted therapy compared with those who receive standard therapy. More RCTs with longer follow ups may lead to more information on adverse events, treatment-related mortality and QoL, and could evaluate whether the PFS advantage seen with standard therapy will translate into a benefit in terms of OS."

None included a placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.). Of 34 comparisons, eight had any notable difference between the study groups in an outcome.

One trial showed the ring group had lower mean AUC insulin (A 51-amino acid pancreatic hormone that plays a major role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, directly by suppressing endogenous glucose production (GLYCOGENOLYSIS; GLUCONEOGENESIS) and indirectly by suppressing GLUCAGON secretion and LIPOLYSIS.) than the levonorgestrel (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE and about twice as potent as its racemic or (+-)-isomer (NORGESTREL).)-COC group (MD -204.51; 95% CI -389.64 to -19.38). Of eight trials of norethisterone (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE but functioning as a more potent inhibitor of ovulation.) preparations, five compared COCs and three compared injectables (A drug or medicine that can be injected). In a COC trial, a norethisterone (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE but functioning as a more potent inhibitor of ovulation.) group had smaller mean change in glucose two-hour response than a levonorgestrel (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE and about twice as potent as its racemic or (+-)-isomer (NORGESTREL).)-COC group (MD -0.30; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.06). In an injectable study, a group using depot (Parenteral sustained-release systems of microparticles, implants (put in the body as a prosthesis, or for treatment or diagnosis.), or biodegradable polymer-excipients designed to release their active pharmaceutical ingredient over a prolonged period of time.) medroxyprogesterone acetate (A synthetic, acetate derivative of the sex hormone progesterone.) had higher means than the group using norethisterone (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE but functioning as a more potent inhibitor of ovulation.) enanthate for fasting glucose (A primary source of energy for living organisms.) (MD 10.05; 95% CI 3.16 to 16.94), glucose two-hour response (MD 17.00; 95% CI 5.67 to 28.33), and fasting insulin (A 51-amino acid pancreatic hormone that plays a major role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, directly by suppressing endogenous glucose production (GLYCOGENOLYSIS; GLUCONEOGENESIS) and indirectly by suppressing GLUCAGON secretion and LIPOLYSIS.)

One showed the group with nomegestrel acetate plus 17\u03b2-estradiol (The 17-beta-isomer of estradiol, an aromatized C18 steroid with hydroxyl group at 3-beta- and 17-beta-position.) had lower means than the levonorgestrel (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE and about twice as potent as its racemic or (+-)-isomer (NORGESTREL).) group for incremental AUC glucose (MD -1.43; 95% CI -2.55 to -0.31) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c (Products of non-enzymatic reactions between GLUCOSE and HEMOGLOBIN A, occurring as a minor fraction of the hemoglobin components of human erythrocytes.)) (MD -0.10; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02). Two trials compared extended versus conventional (cyclic) regimens. With a dienogest (used in hormone therapy and as a female contraceptive.) COC, an extended-use group had greater mean change in AUC glucose (MD 82.00; 95% CI 10.72 to 153.28). In a small trial using two levonorgestrel (A synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of PROGESTERONE and about twice as potent as its racemic or (+-)-isomer (NORGESTREL).) COCs, the lower-dose group showed smaller mean change in fasting glucose (A primary source of energy for living organisms.) (MD -3.00; 95% CI -5.89 to -0.11), but the obese (grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess FATS in the body.) and normal weight women did not differ significantly. Current evidence suggests no major differences in carbohydrate metabolism between different hormonal contraceptives (Chemical substances that prevent or reduce the probability of CONCEPTION.) in women without diabetes. We cannot make strong statements due to having few studies that compared the same types of contraceptives (Chemical substances that prevent or reduce the probability of CONCEPTION.). Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses. Many of the earlier studies had limited reporting of methods. We still know very little about women at risk for metabolic problems due to being overweight. More than half of the trials had weight restrictions as inclusion criteria. Only one small trial stratified the groups by body mass index (obese (grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess FATS in the body.) versus normal).",

                "In April 2014, we looked for randomized trials of how the body handles carbohydrates when using birth control methods with hormones. Outcomes were blood glucose or insulin levels. Birth control methods could contain estrogen and progestin or just progestin. The type could be pills, shots (injections), implants (matchstick-size rods put under the skin), the vaginal ring, or an intrauterine device (IUD). The studies had to compare two types of birth control or one type versus a placebo or 'dummy' method. We included 31 trials. None had a placebo. Of 34 pairs of birth control methods compared, eight showed some difference by study groups. Twelve trials studied pills with desogestrel. The few differences were not consistent. Three trials looked at the etonogestrel ring. One showed the ring group had lower insulin than the pill group. Eight trials looked at the progestin norethisterone. A group using norethisterone pills had less glucose change than those taking other pills. In another study, a group using the injectable \u2018depo\u2019 (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) had higher glucose and insulin than the group using another injectable. Of five new trials, two used different estrogen types. In one study, a group taking a pill with ethinyl valerate had lower glucose than a group taking a standard pill. Two other trials compared taking pills for several cycles without stopping (extended use) versus usual use. In one using a dienogest pill, the extended-use group had more glucose change. A small trial used two levonorgestrel pills, and looked at obese and normal weight women. The outcomes did not differ much between those groups. In women without diabetes, hormone contraceptives have little effect on the body's carbohydrate use. Few studies compared the same types of birth control. Therefore, we cannot make strong statements. Many trials had small numbers of women, and many women dropped out. Older trials often did not report all the study methods. Many trials did not include overweight women."

One of the 10 RCTs was only reported as a conference abstract and did not provide sufficient data for the evaluation of bias risk. High-quality evidence from nine trials (549 participants) indicated that exercise reduced pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.)

Only three small studies (183 participants) evaluated quality of life, with overall low quality evidence, with no benefit of exercise demonstrated (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.36). Quality of life was estimated to be 50 points on a norm-based mean (standard deviation (SD)) score of 50 (10) in the general population in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by 0 points.

The improvement in physical function was also sustained (five RCTs, 367 participants): physical function (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.16). Physical function was estimated to be 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (A device designed for weighing or an indicator device with a graduated sequence of divisions.)

After searching for all relevant studies up to February 2013, we included five new studies since the last version of the review, giving 10 studies (549 participants) with mostly mild-to-moderate symptomatic hip OA, alone or with knee OA. Except for one study where participants enrolled in a tai chi programme, all other participants underwent land-based exercise programmes consisting of traditional muscle strengthening, functional training and aerobic fitness programmes, either individually supervised or as part of a group, compared with people who did not exercise. Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain): - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain to be 8 points lower (4 to 11 points lower) at end of treatment (8% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise. - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain as 21 points. - People who did not exercise rated their pain as 29 points. Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower score means better physical function): - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function to be 7 points lower (1 to 12 points lower) at end of treatment (7% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise. - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function as 22 points. - People who did not exercise rated their physical function as 29 points. Quality of life (higher score means better quality of life): - Overall, people with hip OA participating in the studies had a similar quality of life compared with the general population (normative scores of average 50 points), and quality of life was not further improved by participation in an exercise programme: 0 points higher. - People who completed an exercise programme rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale. - People who did not exercise rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale. Withdrawals - three more people out of 100 dropped out of the exercise programme (1% absolute increase). - Six out of 100 people in exercise programmes dropped out. - Three out of 100 people who did not exercise dropped out. This review showed that there is high-quality evidence that in people with hip OA, exercise reduced pain slightly and improved physical function slightly. Further research is unlikely to change the estimate of these results. Low-quality evidence indicated that exercise may not improve quality of life. Further research is likely to change the estimate of these results. Moderate-quality evidence showed that exercise probably does not increase study drop-outs. Further research may change the estimate. We do not have precise information about side effects such as injuries or falls during exercise, but we would expect these to be rare, and no injuries were reported in the studies."

All of these admissions occurred in the delayed group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours in the early group. The proportion of people who developed serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) was 0/28 (0%) in the early group, which was significantly lower than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Excision of the gallbladder through an abdominal incision using a laparoscope.)

In this trial, 35 participants underwent early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) and 40 participants underwent delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after an average waiting period of approximately four months. The treatment that the participants underwent was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin. This trial was at high risk of bias (systematic errors or errors in study design which may influence the conclusions). There were no deaths in the early group (0 out of 35) (0%) and there was one death (1 out of 40) (2.5%) in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. This difference between the groups was not significantly different. There were no serious complications related to the surgery in either group. During the waiting period, 9 out of 40 participants (22.5%) developed gallstone-related serious complications. Five participants in the delayed group revisited the hospital because of recurrent gallbladder pain. In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms. All of these participants were from the delayed group. All the participants in the early group were operated on within 24 hours. The proportion of participants who developed serious complications was significantly lower in the early group than the proportion of participants in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Quality of life and return to work were not reported in this trial. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who required conversion to open removal of the gallbladder. The hospital stay was significantly shorter (by about one day) in the early group than the delayed group. The operating time was significantly shorter (by about 15 minutes) in the early group than the delayed group. Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed within 24 hours of diagnosis of biliary colic decreases serious complications, hospital stay, and operating time compared with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an average waiting time of four months. Further well designed, randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings."

Only one study measured quality of life, but it did not find any effects; two trials measured fatigue and also failed to find a difference between the treatment and control groups. Eighteen participants (\u02dc 10%) dropped out, and no trials reported any serious adverse events. The six trials that were eligible for inclusion in this review were small, so statistical power was low, making analyses less precise. In addition, studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of respiratory muscle training, dosing/intensity, and the severity of MS. In addition, we could not analyze the effects of training on, for example, cough efficacy, pneumonia, and quality of life, as the included trials did not report on these outcomes even though they are important for patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. Altogether, this review provides low-quality evidence that resistive inspiratory muscle training improves predicted inspiratory muscle strength in people with MS.

Only one eye (The organ of sight constituting a pair of globular organs made up of a three-layered roughly spherical structure specialized for receiving and responding to light.) of each participant was treated as part of the trials. The smaller study had 12 month follow-up data for all participants. For the larger study, four DALK surgeries (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) had to be abandoned due to technical failure and visual and refractive outcomes were not measured in these participants. Follow-up length for the remaining 77 participants ranged from 6.8 to 36.4 months, with all 77 followed for at least three months post-suture removal (removed.). Details of the randomisation procedure were unavailable for the smaller study and so sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) analyses were conducted to determine if the results from this study had affected the overall results of the review. Neither of the included studies reported a difference between groups on any of the measures of post-graft visual achievement, keratometric astigmatism (Unequal curvature of the refractive surfaces of the eye (The organ of sight constituting a pair of globular organs made up of a three-layered roughly spherical structure specialized for receiving and responding to light.).) or spherical equivalent. A single case of graft failure in a penetrating keratoplasty (Partial or total replacement of the CORNEA from one human or animal to another.) (Partial or total replacement of all layers of a central portion of the cornea.) was reported. No postoperative graft failures were reported in the DALK group of either study. Instances of graft rejection were reported in both groups, in both studies. The majority of these cases were successfully treated with steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.)s. The data, which related to all cases in each study - given that the four cases that did not go ahead as planned had already technically failed without presence of rejection - showed that rejection was less likely to occur in DALK (odds ratio (OR): 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.81, GRADE rating: moderate). Results of the sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) analysis (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) indicated that inclusion of the Razmju 2011 study did not bias the results with regards to rejection episodes. While sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) analysis (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) showed altered results with regards to failure rates, the data available from the Javadi 2010 study alone had a very wide 95% CI, suggesting an imprecise estimate. Therefore, even after removal (removed.) of the Razmju 2011 data, it is still difficult to draw conclusions regarding superiority of one technique over another with regards to graft failure. DALK was unable to be completed as planned in four cases and in a further three cases, complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) during dissection (The separation and isolation of tissues for surgical purposes, or for the analysis or study of their structures.) required further intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). Other adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.), of varying severity, were reported in both intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) groups with similar frequency. For both types of surgery, these included postoperative astigmatism (Unequal curvature of the refractive surfaces of the eye (The organ of sight constituting a pair of globular organs made up of a three-layered roughly spherical structure specialized for receiving and responding to light.).), steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) induced ocular hypertension (elevated above normal and which may lead to glaucoma.) and persistent epithelial defects. In recipients of DALK, one participant had interface neovascularisation (A pathologic process consisting of the proliferation of blood vessels (Any of the tubular vessels conveying the blood (arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins).) in abnormal tissues or in abnormal positions.) (a proliferation of blood vessels (Any of the tubular vessels conveying the blood (arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins).) where the host and donor cornea come together) and one had wrinkling of Descemet's membrane (A thin hyaline membrane between the chief part of the sclera and the endothelial layer of the cornea.), the basement membrane separating the corneal stroma (The lamellated connective tissue constituting the thickest layer of the cornea between the Bowman and Descemet membranes.) from the corneal endothelium. In the penetrating keratoplasty (Partial or total replacement of the CORNEA from one human or animal to another.) (Partial or total replacement of all layers of a central portion of the cornea.) groups, one participant required graft resuturing (Materials used in closing a surgical or traumatic wound.) and one had an atonic pupil (The aperture in the iris through which light passes.), a condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) in which the pupil (The aperture in the iris through which light passes.) dilates and is non-reactive. Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low to moderate, with methodological limitations, incomplete data analysis and imprecision of findings, as well as high risk of bias in several areas for both studies. We found no evidence to support a difference in outcomes with regards to BCVA at three months post-graft or at any of the other time points analysed (GRADE rating: very low). We also found no evidence of a difference in outcomes with regards to graft survival, final UCVA or keratometric outcomes. We found some evidence that rejection is more likely to occur following penetrating keratoplasty (Partial or total replacement of the CORNEA from one human or animal to another.) (Partial or total replacement of all layers of a central portion of the cornea.) than DALK (GRADE rating: moderate). The small number of studies included in the review and methodological issues relating to the two, mean that the overall quality of the evidence in this review is low. There is currently insufficient evidence to determine which technique may offer better overall outcomes - final visual acuity and time to attain this, keratometric stabilisation, risk of rejection or failure, or both, and risk of other adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) - for patients with keratoconus (A noninflammatory, usually bilateral protrusion of the cornea, the apex being displaced downward and nasally.). Large randomised trials comparing the outcomes of penetrating keratoplasty (Partial or total replacement of the CORNEA from one human or animal to another.) (Partial or total replacement of all layers of a central portion of the cornea.) and DALK in the treatment of keratoconus (A noninflammatory, usually bilateral protrusion of the cornea, the apex being displaced downward and nasally.) are needed.",

                "We included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved a total of 111 participants in this review. Both trials were conducted in single medical centres in Iran and compared the outcomes, at least three months post-suture removal (for a minimum of 12 months in the newer study, and for a range of 6.8 to 36.4 months in the older study), of participants with keratoconus who had received DALK to those who had received penetrating keratoplasty. The evidence is current to October 2013. The results suggested that graft rejection is more likely to occur following penetrating keratoplasty, however likelihood of graft failure was similar in both groups, as were visual and structural results. DALK was unable to be completed as planned in four cases and in a further three cases complications during dissection required further intervention. Other adverse events, of varying severity, were reported in both intervention groups. For both types of surgery, these included postoperative astigmatism (when the cornea is no longer perfectly curved), raised pressure in the eye following steroid use, and a failure of the epithelium, the front layer of the eye, to heal properly. In recipients of DALK, one participant had interface neovascularisation (a growth of blood vessels where the host and donor cornea come together) and one had wrinkling of Descemet's membrane, a structural element of the cornea. In the penetrating keratoplasty groups, one participant required graft resuturing and one had an atonic pupil, a condition in which the pupil dilates and is non-reactive. The included studies reported adverse events thoroughly. The evidence remains weak, as the quality of evidence is rated very low to moderate. Large trials comparing the outcomes of DALK and penetrating keratoplasty for the treatment of keratoconus, are needed. These should be randomised single-masked trials, in which graft recipients are unaware of their group allocation. Because of the nature of the surgery, it is not likely to be possible to conduct double-masked trials as practitioners who are qualified to undertake outcomes assessments would be able to see which graft a participant had received. Future trials should include regular, long-term follow-up and consistent methods must be used."

(RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82). Evidence that iron (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) supplementation improves cognitive performance in women is uncertain, as studies could not be meta-analysed and individual studies reported conflicting results. Iron supplementation (Adding nutrients to the diet.) improved maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and appears to reduce symptomatic fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.). Although adherence could not be formally meta-analysed due to differences in reporting, there was no evident difference in adherence between women randomised to iron (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) and control. Daily iron (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) supplementation effectively reduces the prevalence of anaemia (A reduction in the number of circulating ERYTHROCYTES or in the quantity of HEMOGLOBIN.) and iron (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) deficiency, raises haemoglobin (The oxygen-carrying proteins of ERYTHROCYTES.) and iron (A metallic element with atomic symbol Fe, atomic number 26, and atomic weight 55.85.) stores, improves exercise performance and reduces symptomatic fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.).

We found evidence that iron supplements reduce the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, and raise levels of haemoglobin in the blood and in iron stores. Iron supplementation clearly increases the risk of side effects, for example, constipation and abdominal pain. We found high quality evidence that iron improves haemoglobin and produces changes in bowel function, but moderate quality evidence that iron reduces the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency. Evidence of the effects of iron on other outcomes, such as abdominal pain, is of low quality. There are no data on the effects of iron on mortality in this population group.

Longer progression-free survival was observed in those treated with the combination chemotherapy (Therapy with two or more separate preparations given for a combined effect.)

The quality of evidence for overall survival was low and for progression-free survival was moderate, mainly due to study limitation from the lack of information on randomisation methods and allocation concealment. There were higher risks of toxicity outcomes grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (An increased liquidity or decreased consistency of FECES, such as running stool.) and grade 1 or 2 alopecia (normally present.), and a lower risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (A decrease in the number of LEUKOCYTES in a blood sample below the normal range (LEUKOCYTE COUNT less than 4000).) in controls compared to the invervention group.

There is no evidence to suggest any superiority of the combination of IRI and fluoropyrimidine over IRI alone, but our results on overall survival are limited by the number of studies available to date. Longer progression-free survival was seen from adding fluoropyrimidines to IRI. Based on current evidence, both the combination regimens and IRI alone seem equally effective for treating advanced or metastatic patients. Patients in the intervention arm were less likely to develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and grade 1 or 2 alopecia, and more likely to have grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, compared to patients receiving IRI alone.

The data on pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) is less clear and should be interpreted with caution but some data suggests a transverse incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) is less pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.)ful (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.). There was no difference seen in other early or late post-operative complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) and recovery times were similar although the transverse incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) may be cosmetically more acceptable. The analgesia (A form of therapy that employs a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those experiencing pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.).) use and the pulmonary (Either of the pair of organs occupying the cavity of the thorax that effect the aeration of the blood.) compromise may be reduced with a transverse/oblique incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) but this does not seem to be significant clinically as pulmonary (Either of the pair of organs occupying the cavity of the thorax that effect the aeration of the blood.) complication rates and recovery times were the same. The likelihood of wound dehiscence (Separation of the layers of a surgical wound; it may be partial and superficial only, or complete with disruption of all layers.) and rupture appears to be reduced with a transverse incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) and a transverse incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) may look better.

Individuals receiving multidisciplinary treatment had less pain, less disability, increased likelihood of return-to-work and fewer sick leave days at 12-month follow-up.

Although we examined adverse events as a secondary outcome, none of the included studies reported this outcome. The quality of the evidence for this review was generally low to very low. This was mainly due to small sample sizes and other study limitations. Moreover, we grouped together studies with differing interventions and comparisons.

Bisphosphonates (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) probably increased the number of participants affected by nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; P = 0.05; I2 = 0%; 9 trials; 3008 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) resulted in seven more cases of nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) per 1000 (0 fewer to 14 more). Bisphosphonates (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) probably increased the number of renal adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.46; P = 0.01; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 1794 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) resulted in 22 more renal adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) per 1000 (4 more to 50 more). We found no clear difference in the number of participants with osteonecrosis (Death of a bone or part of a bone, either atraumatic or posttraumatic.) of the jaw (Bony structure of the mouth that holds the teeth.) between groups (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.90; P = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 5 trials; 1626 participants; very low quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) resulted in seven more cases with osteonecrosis (Death of a bone or part of a bone, either atraumatic or posttraumatic.) of the jaw (Bony structure of the mouth that holds the teeth.) per 1000 (2 fewer to 29 more). We observed no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of participants with decreased analgesic consumption (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; P = 0.28; I2 = 37%; 4 trials; 416 participants). Statistical analysis revealed that bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) probably reduced the number of participants with disease progression (The worsening of a disease over time.) (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98; P = 0.006; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 2115 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) resulted in 36 fewer cases of disease progression (The worsening of a disease over time.) per 1000 (71 fewer to 7 fewer). Findings of our predefined subgroup and sensitivity analyses were no different from those of the primary analyses. Based on low quality evidence, there may be no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of men with pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) response between bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) and control regimens in men with bone metastases (Cancer that has spread from the original (primary) tumor to the bone.) from prostate cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant tumor involving the prostate gland.). Bisphosphonates (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.) probably decrease the number of skeletal-related events and disease progression (The worsening of a disease over time.). These benefits need to be weighed against the increased risk of renal impairment (Diminished kidney function.) and nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) in men receiving bisphosphonate (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.)s (Organic compounds which contain P-C-P bonds, where P stands for phosphonates or phosphonic acids.). Future studies should explicitly evaluate patient important outcomes such as quality of life and pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) by using standardized and comparable assessment tools.",

                "We searched medical databases to 13 July 2017. Two review authors independently screened, summarized and analyzed the findings. This led to the inclusion of 18 clinical trials. We found low quality evidence that bisphosphonates provided no clinically relevant difference in pain response (three studies involving 876 men) compared to placebo (pretend treatment) or no additional treatment. Bisphosphonates reduced pain in 40 more men per 1000 men (19 fewer to 114 more). We found moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably resulted in 58 fewer skeletal-related events per 1000 (85 fewer to 27 fewer). Bisphosphonates showed no clear difference in the number of men who died or the number of men with decreased use of pain killers. We observed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of men with nausea. Bisphosphonates resulted in seven more men with nausea per 1000 men (0 fewer to 14 more). We found moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of men with kidney problems. In this case, bisphosphonates resulted in 22 more men with renal complications per 1000 men (4 more to 50 more). For osteonecrosis of the jaw (where the jaw bone weakens and dies), we found very low quality evidence that bisphosphonates showed no clear difference. We observed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably decreased the number of men affected by disease progression (where the disease got worse). This means that bisphosphonates resulted in 36 fewer men with disease progression per 1000 men (71 fewer to 7 fewer). We found no useable data on quality of life. We judged the quality of evidence as moderate to very low."

            "input": "Our search strategies led to 3046 potentially relevant references. Of these, five RCTs involving 1093 patients were included; four trials in previously untreated patients and one trial in relapsed patients. Overall, the quality of the five trials is judged to be moderate. All trials were reported as randomised and judged to be open-label studies, because usually trials evaluating stem cell transplantation (Transfer of HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS from BONE MARROW or BLOOD between individuals within the same species (TRANSPLANTATION, HOMOLOGOUS) or transfer within the same individual (TRANSPLANTATION, AUTOLOGOUS).) are not blinded. Due to the small number of studies in each analysis (four or less), the quantification of heterogeneity was not reliable and not evaluated in further detail. A potential source of bias are uncertainties in the HR calculation. For OS, the HR had to be calculated for three trials from survival curves, for PFS for two trials. We found a statistically significant increased PFS in previously untreated FL patients in the HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) arm (HR = 0.42 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.54; P < 0.00001). However, this effect is not transferred into a statistically significant OS advantage (HR = 0.97; 95% 0.76 to 1.24; P = 0.81). The subgroup of trials adding rituximab (used in the treatment of LEUKEMIA; LYMPHOMA and RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.) to both intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) arms (one trial) confirms these results and the trial had to be stopped early after an interim analysis due to a statistically significant PFS advantage in the HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) arm (PFS: HR = 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; OS: HR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.92). In the four trials in previously untreated patients there are no statistically significant differences between HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) and the control-arm in terms of TRM (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 0.25 to 6.61; P = 0.77), secondary acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (An acute myeloid leukemia with at least 20% blasts in the bone marrow or blood, and either a previous history of myelodysplastic syndrome, multilineage dysplasia or myelodysplastic syndrome-related cytogenetic abnormalities.) (RR = 2.87; 95% CI 0.7 to 11.75; P = 0.14) or solid cancers (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) (RR = 1.20; 95% CI 0.25 to 5.77; P = 0.82). Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were rarely reported and were observed more frequently in patients undergoing HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) (mostly infections (The invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents and their multiplication, as well as the reaction by the host to these organisms and/or toxins that the organisms produce.) and haematological toxicity). For patients with relapsed FL, there is some evidence (one trial, N = 70) that HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) is advantageous in terms of PFS and OS (PFS: HR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.61; OS: HR = 0.40; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.89). For this trial, no results were reported for TRM, adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) or secondary cancers (The transfer of a neoplasm from one organ or part of the body to another remote from the primary site.). In summary, the currently available evidence suggests a strong PFS benefit for HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) compared with chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) or immuno-chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) (Use of techniques, biologically active substances, and procedures to enhance or restore the ability of the host immune system to fight cancer.) in previously untreated patients with FL. No statistically significant differences in terms of OS, TRM and secondary cancers (The transfer of a neoplasm from one organ or part of the body to another remote from the primary site.) were detected. These effects are confirmed in a subgroup analysis (one trial) adding rituximab (used in the treatment of LEUKEMIA; LYMPHOMA and RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.) to both treatment arms. Further trials evaluating this approach are needed to determine this effect more precisely in the era of rituximab (used in the treatment of LEUKEMIA; LYMPHOMA and RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.). Moreover, longer follow-up data are necessary to find out whether the PFS advantage will translate into an OS advantage in previously untreated patients with FL. There is evidence that HDT + ASCT (continuous X-ray exposure to the patient while being transported in a spiral or helical pattern through the beam of irradiation.) is advantageous in patients with relapsed FL.",

We included five trials with 1093 patients in the main analyses. As a result, the meta-analyses for previously untreated patients (four trials) show no statistical significant differences in terms of survival, treatment-related mortality or secondary malignancies between the patients treated with high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and those treated with chemotherapy only. However, progression-free survival (tumour control), was significantly improved by the high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. Adverse events are more common in patients treated with high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. There is an advantage of the high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation for patients with a relapse of the disease, both in survival and in tumour control (one trial). No data on adverse events are reported in this trial."

There was a high risk of performance bias within the trials but overall, risk for selection, attrition and reporting bias was low or unclear. Data showed WDD improved the short-term global state of participants compared with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) or no treatment (1 RCT n = 72, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.73, low-quality evidence). When WDD was compared with antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) drugs, such as chlorpromazine (The prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug.) or risperidone (A selective blocker of DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS and SEROTONIN 5-HT2 RECEPTORS that acts as an atypical antipsychotic agent.), no difference in short-term global state of participants was observed (2 RCTs n = 140, RR 1.18 95% CI 0.98 to 1.43, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (total endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS): 2 RCTs, n = 140, MD 0.84, 95% CI -4.17 to 5.84, low-quality evidence). However, WDD was associated with fewer people experiencing extrapyramidal effects (Uncrossed tracts of motor nerves from the brain to the anterior horns of the spinal cord, involved in reflexes, locomotion, complex movements, and postural control.) (EPS) compared with other treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) (2 RCTs 0/70 versus 47/70, n = 140, RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15, moderate-quality evidence). WDD is often used as an add-on intervention alongside antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.)s. When WDD + antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) was compared to antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) alone, the combination group had better global state (short-term results, 6 RCTs, n = 684, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) and mental state (short-term total endpoint PANSS: 5 RCTs, n = 580, MD -11.64, 95% CI -13.33 to - 9.94, low-quality evidence), fewer people with EPS (2 RCTs n = 308, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.70, moderate-quality evidence) and reduction of the mean use of risperidone (A selective blocker of DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS and SEROTONIN 5-HT2 RECEPTORS that acts as an atypical antipsychotic agent.) (1 RCT n = 107, MD -0.70, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.53, low-quality evidence). But, there was no effect on weight gain (1 RCT n = 108, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.24, low-quality evidence). When WDD + low-dose antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) was compared with normal-dose antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) alone, the combination again showed benefits for short-term global state (7 RCTs n = 522, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.93, moderate-quality evidence), mental state (total endpoint PANSS: 4 RCTs n = 250, MD -9.53, 95% CI -17.82 to -1.24, low-quality evidence), and fewer participants with EPS (3 RCTS n = 280, RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.51, moderate-quality evidence). Across all comparisons, we found no data on outcomes directly reporting quality of life, hospital service use and economics. Limited evidence suggests that WDD may have some positive short-term antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.) global effects compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) or no treatment. However when WDD was compared with other antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.)s there was no effect on global or mental state, but WDD was associated with fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic (Agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect.), positive effects were found for global and mental state and the combination caused fewer adverse effects. The available evidence is not high quality. Better designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.).",

We screened all records found in this search and included those that met our inclusion criteria and reported useful data. Fifteen trials (with a total of 1437 participants) provided useable, but limited, data. Results showed that WDD may have some beneficial effects on short-term global outcomes and mental state of people with schizophrenia compared to placebo or no treatment but did not show a benefit when compared to antipsychotics - although WDD did cause fewer adverse effects. When WDD was combined with an antipsychotic, there were observed benefits for WDD on improving global state and reducing the side effects caused by antipsychotics. Results of this review suggest WDD may be helpful for people with schizophrenia, but these results are based on low to moderate evidence and there is not enough high-quality evidence to make firm conclusions. Better-designed large studies are needed to fully and fairly test the effects of WDD for people with schizophrenia."

None of the studies reported the adverse outcome of root resorption (lost from the root of a tooth owing to cementoclastic or osteoclastic activity in conditions such as trauma of occlusion or neoplasms.). The review assessed six comparisons. 1. Multistrand stainless steel (Stainless steel.) versus superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) arch wires (Steel wires, often threaded through the skin, soft tissues, and bone, used to fix broken bones.). There were five studies in this group and it was appropriate to undertake a meta-analysis of two of them.

There was only one study (24 participants) in this group. There is moderate-quality evidence that coaxial superelastic NiTi can produce greater tooth movement (Orthodontic techniques used to correct the malposition of a tooth or teeth.) over 12 weeks (MD -6.76 mm, 95% CI -7.98 to -5.55).

We found 12 RCTs with 799 participants, all of whom had upper or lower full arch fixed braces, or both. The studies evaluated different initial arch wires, but they were poorly conducted or reported, or both, and their results are likely to be biased. The studies varied in a number of other aspects of orthodontic treatment, compared different types of initial arch wires and reported different outcomes at different times. None of the studies reported both potential benefits (straightening) and harms (pain or side effects such as tooth root shortening). We found moderate-quality evidence that coaxial superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) can produce greater tooth movement over 12 weeks than single-strand superelastic NiTi. We found moderate-quality evidence that there is no difference in pain at day 1 between multistrand stainless steel versus superelastic NiTi arch wires. There is insufficient evidence from our included studies to know if any other particular initial arch wire material is better or worse than another, or if they function equally well, with regard to speed of straightening, pain or tooth shortening in people undergoing orthodontic treatment. There was moderate-quality evidence that coaxial superelastic NiTi can produce greater tooth movement than single-strand superelastic NiTi, and that there is no real difference in pain whether whether arch wires are made with multistrand stainless steel or superelastic NiTi. The quality of the evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes was low or very low. Overall, the evidence about initial arch wires in orthodontic treatment is very limited, with comparisons often assessed by one small study with problems in its design.

For the CMAI, the study reports a Global score (29 items rated on a seven-point scale (1 = never occurs to 7 = occurs several times an hour) and summed to give a total score ranging from 29 to 203) and mean scores (evaluable items (rated on the same 7-point scale) divided by the theoretical total number of items) for the following four domains: Physically Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as pacing (13 items); Verbally Non-Aggressive Behaviour, such as repetition (four items); Physically Aggressive Behaviour, such as hitting (nine items); and Verbally Aggressive Behaviour, such as swearing (three items). Four of the five CMAI scales (A device designed for weighing or an indicator device with a graduated sequence of divisions.) improved in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group (Global: change mean difference (MD) \u22125.69 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22129.59 to \u22121.79; Physically Non-Aggressive: change MD \u22120.32 points, 95% CI \u22120.49 to \u22120.15; Verbally Non-Aggressive: change MD \u22120.44 points, 95% CI \u22120.69 to \u22120.19; and Verbally Aggressive: change MD \u22120.16 points, 95% CI \u22120.31 to \u22120.01).

Using GRADE guidelines, we rated the quality of this evidence as very low due to high risk of bias and indirectness of the outcome measures. There were no differences in NPI or OS change scores between groups by the end of the study. We also identified one ongoing study.

The study did not assess areas important to us, such as the number of injuries sustained by staff or residents. It did, however, measure the impact of staff training on residents' level of aggression three months after the end of the training. Some measures of physical and verbal aggression showed reductions, but not all. The reliability of evidence available in the one included trial is very low and did not address important questions such as injury.

Eleven trials had a small sample size and short follow-up periods. .The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high. The data were not suitable for meta-analysis due to heterogeneity in participant population, skin care products (Any skin care product containing humectants, emollients and emulsifiers with moisturizing activity.), skin care procedures, outcomes, and measurement tools. Nine trials compared different topical skin care products (Any skin care product containing humectants, emollients and emulsifiers with moisturizing activity.)

We found evidence in two trials, being of low and moderate quality, that soap and water (essential for most animal and plant life and an excellent solvent for many substances.) performed poorly in the prevention (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) and treatment of IAD (An alkylamino-alcohol complex of inosine used in the treatment of a variety of viral infections.) (primary outcomes of this review). The first trial indicated that the use of a skin cleanser might be more effective than the use of soap and water (essential for most animal and plant life and an excellent solvent for many substances.) (risk ratio (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.87; low quality evidence). The second trial indicated that a structured skin care procedure, being a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising, and protecting properties, might be more effective than soap and water (essential for most animal and plant life and an excellent solvent for many substances.) (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.79; moderate quality evidence). Findings from the other trials, all being of low to very low quality, suggest that applying a leave-on product (moisturiser, skin protectant (a sterile device that a liquid, semiliquid, or powder and liquid combination used to cover an opening in the skin or as a dressing for burns.), or a combination) might be more effective than not applying a leave-on product. No trial reported on the third primary outcome 'number of participants not satisfied with treatment' or on adverse effects. Little evidence, of very low to moderate quality, exists on the effects of interventions for preventing (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) and treating IAD (An alkylamino-alcohol complex of inosine used in the treatment of a variety of viral infections.) in adults. Soap and water (essential for most animal and plant life and an excellent solvent for many substances.) performed poorly in the prevention (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) and treatment of IAD (An alkylamino-alcohol complex of inosine used in the treatment of a variety of viral infections.). Application of leave-on products (moisturisers, skin protectant (a sterile device that a liquid, semiliquid, or powder and liquid combination used to cover an opening in the skin or as a dressing for burns.)s, or a combination) and avoiding soap seems to be more effective than withholding these products. The performance of leave-on products depends on the combination of ingredients, the overall formulation and the usage (e.g. amount applied). High quality confirmatory trials using standardised, and comparable prevention (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) and treatment regimens (A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.) in different settings/regions are required.

The participants had to be over 18 years of age. We found thirteen, mostly small, trials, involving 1316 participants. All participants were incontinent for urine, stool, or both and lived in nursing homes or were hospitalised. The trials tested skin care products, procedures, and frequencies of using a skin care product. Two trials showed that soap and water performed poorly in the prevention and treatment of IAD. A skin cleanser or a washcloth with cleansing, moisturising and protecting properties may be more effective than soap and water. The findings from the other trials suggest that using a skin care product is more effective than withholding a skin care product. We found no evidence that one skin care product performed better than another. The trials did not report on adverse effects. The quality of the evidence was low. Eleven trials had small numbers of participants and were of short duration. The overall risk of bias was high. The trials included in this review tested skin care products, procedures and frequencies of using a skin care product. Very limited evidence exists on the effects of interventions for preventing and treating IAD in adults. Larger, long-term and well performed trials are required. Furthermore, we recommend the development of a list of outcomes which are important for patients and will guide researchers in their study. This list should include well developed tools to measure the items in order to obtain accurate results. The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 28 September 2016."

            "input": "We included seven RCTs with a total of 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages (Nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins or lipids which accumulate in vascular tissue during aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes.) ranged from two years to young adults. The type of antiviral (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.), administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antiviral (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.)s (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.) in the included studies were acyclovir (A GUANOSINE analog that acts as an antimetabolite.), valomaciclovir (A prodrug form of the acyclic guanosine derivative omaciclovir with activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV) and other members of the herpesvirus family.) and valacyclovir (used in the treatment of HERPES ZOSTER and HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTION of the skin and mucous membranes, including GENITAL HERPES.) (A GUANOSINE analog that acts as an antimetabolite.). Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months. The diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of IM was based on clinical symptoms (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) and laboratory parameters. The risk of bias for all included studies was either unclear or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution. There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes. These improvements may be of limited clinical significance. There was a mean reduction in 'time to clinical recovery as assessed by physician' of five days in the treatment group but with wide confidence intervals (CIs (A lesion with cytological characteristics associated with invasive carcinoma but the tumor cells are confined to the epithelium of origin, without invasion of the basement membrane.)) (95% CI -8.04 to -1.08; two studies, 87 participants). Prospective studies indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result. Trial results for the outcome 'adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s and side effects of medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.)' were reported narratively in only five studies. In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) was related to medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) or complication (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) of disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.). These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups. There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy (Disease or swelling of the lymph nodes.)' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies, 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group. In terms of viral shedding (The expelling of virus particles from the body.), the overall effect from six studies was that viral shedding (The expelling of virus particles from the body.) was suppressed while on antiviral (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.) treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped. For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.) treatment and control groups. The effectiveness of antiviral (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.) agents (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.) (acyclovir (A GUANOSINE analog that acts as an antimetabolite.), valomaciclovir (A prodrug form of the acyclic guanosine derivative omaciclovir with activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV) and other members of the herpesvirus family.) and valacyclovir (used in the treatment of HERPES ZOSTER and HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS INFECTION of the skin and mucous membranes, including GENITAL HERPES.) (A GUANOSINE analog that acts as an antimetabolite.)) in acute IM is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is very low. The majority of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.), or improve health in other ways.). Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful. Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s and possible associated costs, and antiviral (Agents used in the prophylaxis or therapy of VIRUS DISEASES.) resistance. Further research in this area is warranted.",

                "We included seven studies that involved a total of 333 people; two were conducted in Europe and five in the USA. Three studies took place in hospitals, one each in a student health centre and a children's clinic, but the setting was unclear in two studies. Three different antiviral drugs were studied: acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir, as well as dosage, comparison treatment (fake or no treatment), and how long people were treated and followed up. One study did not report study funding, but the other six studies appeared to have some industry support. None declared conflicts of interest, but one included two authors from a drug company. We wanted to investigate several outcomes: time to recovery; medication side effects; duration of: fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged spleen and liver; development of glandular fever complications; how long it took to eliminate the virus from the throat; health-related quality of life; days off school or work; and economic outcomes. We found improvements in participants who received antiviral for two outcomes. There was an improvement of five days in time taken to recover among people who received antiviral treatment, but this result was not very precise, and the way it was measured was not clearly defined. Other studies show that glandular fever symptoms can take a month or more to get better, and tiredness may occur in about one in every 10 of patients six months later. This improvement may be of limited clinical significance. Most studies that examined adverse effects did not find any differences between people who received antivirals and those who did not. Time taken to resolve lymph node swelling improved to nine days when antivirals were used. However, studies that reported on this, measured lymph node swelling in different ways so we cannot be sure about the accuracy of the result. Evidence quality was rated as very low for all results, which means that we cannot know the exact effect of using antivirals for glandular fever. Better studies are needed so we can draw firm conclusions."

Two of the faecal incontinence trials had a 'parallel group design', which means that one group of participants received SNS and the other control group did not receive SNS throughout the trial. The remaining six trials had a 'crossover design', in which the participants experienced equal periods with stimulation 'off' then 'on', or vice versa. The level of stimulation was such that participants could not tell whether the system was 'on' or 'off'. In the two 'parallel group' trials, 53 and 15 participants with faecal incontinence who were in the SNS group experienced fewer episodes of faecal incontinence compared to the control group at 3 and 12 months. In the first crossover trial, 24 participants who completed the trial chose the period of stimulation they had preferred while still unaware whether this was 'on' or 'off'. Nineteen participants who preferred the 'on' period experienced 59% fewer episodes of FI per week during the 'on' period, and 5 participants who preferred the 'off' period experienced 118% more episodes of FI per week. In the second crossover trial, the participants did not experience episodes of FI during either the 'on' or the 'off' periods. In the third trial, participants experienced 83% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' compared with the 'off' period. In the fourth crossover trial participants experienced 88% fewer episodes of faecal incontinence during the 'on' period compared with the 'off' period. \u2014adverse effects:Not all trials reported adverse effects after SNS.

In the first crossover study 7 out of 34 participants were excluded from crossover due mainly to complications. Four out of 27 participants with an implanted system in this study experienced a problem that led to the device being removed. The participants in the fourth crossover trial experienced some complications with the SNS implanted electrode such as pain (one person), misplacement of the tined lead (one person) and haematoma (swelling containing blood) (three people). In one trial assessing SNS for constipation, two participants reported an increase of 150% in the frequency of passing stools per week, and time with abdominal pain and swelling went down from 79% during the 'off' period to 33% during the 'on' period. However, in the much larger second trial assessing SNS for constipation, in 59 participants SNS did not improve frequency of bowel movements. The limited evidence suggests that SNS can improve continence in some people with faecal incontinence. SNS did not improve symptoms in patients with constipation. Larger, good-quality trials are needed to provide more reliable evidence on the effectiveness of SNS for these two conditions."

We collected the data on 7747 patients with gastric cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the stomach.) who were staged with EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.). Overall the quality of the included studies was good: in particular, only five studies presented a high risk of index test interpretation bias and two studies presented a high risk of selection bias. For primary tumor (T) stage, results were stratified according to the depth of invasion (The local spread of tumor cells of a malignant neoplasm through infiltration or destruction of adjacent tissue; for epithelial neoplasms, invasion signifies infiltration beneath the epithelial basement membrane.) of the gastric wall. The meta-analysis of 50 studies (n = 4397) showed that the summary sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and specificity of EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) in discriminating T1 to T2 (superficial) versus T3 (A T3 thyroid hormone normally synthesized and secreted by the thyroid gland in much smaller quantities than thyroxine (T4).) to T4 (The major hormone derived from the thyroid gland.)

For the diagnostic (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) capacity of EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) to distinguish T1 (early gastric cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the stomach.), EGC (An invasive adenocarcinoma confined to the mucosa or mucosa and submucosa of the gastric wall.)) versus T2 (muscle-infiltrating) tumors, the meta-analysis of 46 studies (n = 2742) showed that the summary sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.93) respectively. When we addressed the capacity of EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) to distinguish between T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers the meta-analysis of 20 studies (n = 3321) showed that the summary sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and specificity were 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.84) respectively. Finally, for the metastatic involvement of lymph nodes (They are oval or bean shaped bodies (1 - 30 mm in diameter) located along the lymphatic system.) (N-stage), the meta-analysis of 44 studies (n = 3573) showed that the summary sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) and specificity were 0.83 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.87) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.72), respectively. Overall, as demonstrated also by the Bayesian nomograms, which enable readers to calculate post-test probabilities for any target condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) prevalence, the EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) accuracy can be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the stomach.). However, it should be noted that between-study heterogeneity was not negligible: unfortunately, we could not identify any consistent source of the observed heterogeneity. Therefore, all accuracy measures reported in the present work and summarizing the available evidence should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, we must emphasize that the analysis of positive and negative likelihood values revealed that EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) diagnostic (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) performance cannot be considered optimal either for disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) confirmation or for exclusion, especially for the ability of EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) to distinguish T1a (mucosal) versus T1b (submucosal) cancers and positive versus negative lymph node status. By analyzing the data from the largest series ever considered, we found that the diagnostic (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) accuracy of EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) might be considered clinically useful to guide physicians in the locoregional staging of people with gastric carcinoma (Cancer that forms in tissues lining the stomach.). However, the heterogeneity of the results warrants special caution, as well as further investigation for the identification of factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.) influencing the outcome of this diagnostic (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) tool (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.). Moreover, physicians should be warned that EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) performance is lower in diagnosing (The determination of the nature of a disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) or condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.), or the distinguishing of one disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) or condition (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) from another.) superficial tumors (T1a versus T1b) and lymph node status (positive versus negative). Overall, we observed large heterogeneity and its source needs to be understood before any definitive conclusion can be drawn about the use of EUS (An ultrasound administered by using a tube containing flexible fibre optic wires that allows for the analysis of tissues inside the body.) can be proposed in routine clinical settings.",

We included 66 studies (of 7747 patients) in the review. We found that EUS can distinguish between superficial (T1 - T2) and advanced (T3 - T4) primary tumors with a sensitivity and a specificity greater than 85%. This performance is maintained for the discrimination between T1 and T2 superficial tumors. However, EUS diagnostic accuracy is lower when it comes to distinguishing between the different types of early tumors (T1a versus T1b) and between tumors with versus those without lymph node disease. Overall, EUS provides physicians with some helpful information on the stage of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, in the light of the variability of the results reported in the international medical literature, its limitations in terms of performance must be kept in mind in order to make the most out of the diagnostic potential of this tool. Finally, more work is needed to assess whether some technical improvements and the combination with other staging instruments may increase our ability to correctly stage the disease and thus optimize patient treatment."

With regards to primary outcomes, only one trial reported short-term mortality. However, the trial stated that there were no deaths in either of the groups. We inferred from the other outcomes that there was no short-term mortality in the remaining trials. Long-term mortality was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the rate of serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) between the two groups (4 trials; 391 participants; 7/191 (weighted rate 1.6%) in the day-surgery group versus 1/200 (0.5%) in the overnight stay surgery group; rate ratio 3.24; 95% CI 0.74 to 14.09). There was no significant difference in quality of life between the two groups (4 trials; 333 participants; SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.33 to 0.10).

For all outcomes except pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), the accrued information was far less than the diversity-adjusted required information size to exclude random errors. Day-surgery appears just as safe as overnight stay surgery in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Excision of the gallbladder through an abdominal incision using a laparoscope.). Day-surgery does not seem to result in improvement in any patient-oriented outcomes such as return to normal activity or earlier return to work. The randomised clinical trials backing these statements are weakened by risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance).

                "This review aims to investigate the current literature available and provides an overview of the evidence demonstrated in recent clinical trials on the subject. The review authors identified a total of six trials involving 492 participants. Two hundred and thirty-nine people underwent planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy as day-surgery and 253 participants stayed in the hospital overnight after the procedure. All the trials were at high risk of bias (methodological deficiencies that might make it possible to arrive at wrong conclusions by overestimating the benefit or underestimating the harm of the day-surgery or overnight stay procedure). We looked at outcomes that are considered to be important from the perspective of the participant and also the healthcare provider. These outcomes include death, serious complication, quality of life following procedure, pain, how long it took for people to return to normal activity and to return to work, hospital readmissions, and failed discharges (failure to be discharged as planned). There was no significant difference in the proportion who died or the complication rate between the group who underwent day-surgery and those who stayed overnight. Quality of life did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the time taken for people to return to normal activity or to return to work. There was also no significant difference in the hospital readmission or failed discharge rates. The results suggest that day-surgery is safe for patients. It is important to note that all trials were at risk of bias and the data were sparse, resulting in a considerable chance of arriving at wrong conclusions due to systematic errors (overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of day-surgery or overnight stay) and random errors (play of chance). More randomised trials are needed to investigate the impact of day-surgery and overnight stay on the quality of life and other outcomes of people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy."

Studies were of generally good methodological quality; we judged only one study at high risk of bias, due to small size. Two studies used a placebo (Any dummy medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) control and six used 0.04% topical capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) as an 'active' placebo (Any dummy medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) to help maintain blinding. Efficacy outcomes were inconsistently reported, resulting in analyses for most outcomes being based on less than complete data. For postherpetic neuralgia (Pain that occurs after the disappearance of herpes zoster infection lesions.), we found four studies (1272 participants). At both 8 and 12 weeks about 10% more participants reported themselves much or very much improved with high-concentration capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) than with 'active' placebo (Any dummy medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.); the point estimates of numbers needed to treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTs) were 8.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3 to 26) at 8 weeks and 7.0 (95% CI 4.6 to 15) at 12 weeks (2 studies, 571 participants; moderate quality evidence). More participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 8-week and 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% and at least 50% with capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) than control, with NNT values between 10 and 12 (2 to 4 studies, 571 to 1272 participants; very low quality evidence). For painful (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) HIV-neuropathy, we found two studies (801 participants).

For both studies, more participants (about 10%) had average 2 to 12-week pain intensity reductions over baseline of at least 30% with capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) than control, with an NNT of 11 (very low quality evidence). For peripheral diabetic neuropathy, we found one study (369 participants). It reported about 10% more participants who were much or very much improved at 8 and 12 weeks. One small study of 46 participants with persistent pain following inguinal herniorrhaphy did not show a difference between capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) and placebo (Any dummy medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) for pain reduction (very low quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for efficacy outcomes by one to three levels due to sparse data, imprecision, possible effects of imputation methods, and susceptibility to publication bias. Local adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were common, but not consistently reported. Serious adverse events were no more common with active treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment (Technique in which the person voluntarily performs an osteopathic practitioner directed motion.)

Adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) withdrawals did not differ between groups, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were somewhat more common with control than active treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment (Technique in which the person voluntarily performs an osteopathic practitioner directed motion.), based on small numbers of events (six to eight studies, 21 to 67 events; moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to few events). No deaths were judged to be related to study medication (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.). High-concentration topical capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) used to treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) postherpetic neuralgia (Pain that occurs after the disappearance of herpes zoster infection lesions.), HIV-neuropathy, and painful (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) diabetic neuropathy generated more participants with moderate or substantial levels of pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.) than control treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment using a much lower concentration of capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.). These results should be interpreted with caution as the quality of the evidence was moderate or very low. The additional proportion who benefited over control was not large, but for those who did obtain high levels of pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.), there were usually additional improvements in sleep, fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.), depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.), and quality of life. High-concentration topical capsaicin (An alkylamide found in CAPSICUM that acts at TRPV CATION CHANNELS.) is similar in its effects to other therapies (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for chronic pain (Aching sensation that persists for more than a few months.).",

                "We searched scientific databases for studies that looked at the effects of high-concentration capsaicin in adults who had moderate or severe neuropathic pain. The treatment had to have effects measured for at least 8 weeks. The evidence is current to June 2016. Eight studies satisfied our inclusion criteria, including two new studies for this update. The studies were well conducted. In seven studies, involving 2442 participants, we found that the treatment gave good levels of pain relief to a small number of participants with some types of neuropathic pain (pain after shingles, and nerve injury pain associated with HIV infection), and probably also in another type (painful feet because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes). About 4 in 10 people had at least moderate pain relief with capsaicin compared with 3 in 10 with control. The control was a treatment that looked the same but did not contain high levels of capsaicin, with either nothing added, or very small amounts of capsaicin added. In one small study (46 participants) in people with persistent pain after hernia surgery, it did not seem better than control. In all people who have this treatment there can be short-lived localised skin problems such as redness, burning, or pain. Serious problems seem to be uncommon, and were no more frequent in these trials with high-concentration capsaicin than with control using very low-concentration capsaicin or placebo. Slightly more people treated with control rather than capsaicin dropped out of the studies because of lack of benefit, but there was no difference between the groups for drop-outs because of side effects. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate or very low for pain relief outcomes, mainly because only a small number of studies and moderate number of participants provided information for each outcome. We judged the quality of the evidence as moderate for harmful effects. Moderate quality means that further research may change the result. Very low quality means we are very uncertain about the results."

The trials were carried out in Europe, USA, and Canada and included some centres in Israel, South Africa, and Australia. The gender ratio of participants was 2.6:1 (72% men and 28% women); 90% of participants were younger than 75 years old. The results of the three trials were initially conflicting because they differed in how they measured carotid stenosis and how they defined the outcomes. To address this discrepancy, we reassessed the patient data using the same methods and definitions, so results could be compared. The results of the review are current up to July 2016. Results showed that older male participants with 70% to 99% stenosis, without occlusion, and recent (within two weeks) TIA or stroke, had the most benefit from surgery, assuming they were well enough for surgery, and their surgeons had a record of low complication rates (less than 7% risk of stroke and death). Carotid endarterectomy also benefited participants with 50% to 99% carotid stenosis and symptoms. For participants whose carotid artery was nearly occluded, benefit was uncertain in the long term. Surgery tended to harm participants with less than 30% stenosis. The second European Carotid Surgery Trial, which is currently recruiting participants, is exploring whether a lipid lowering agent (statin) might be a better choice than carotid endarterectomy to prevent ischaemic stroke in ipsilateral carotid stenosis, which may benefit those who did not benefit from surgery in these trials. We found the evidence to be high quality for near occlusion and less than 30% carotid stenosis; and moderate quality for 50% to 99% carotid stenosis for any stroke or operative death, as well as ipsilateral ischaemic stroke and any operative stroke or death outcome."

The results were also inconclusive for the subgroup analysis in which we compared the effect of ileostomy (Surgical creation of an external opening into the ILEUM for fecal diversion or drainage.) versus colostomy (The surgical construction of an opening between the colon and the surface of the body.) on parastomal herniation. The study did not measured other stoma-related morbidities, or stoma-related mortality, but did measure quality of life, which was not one of our outcomes of interest. Non-randomized studies (NRS) Ten retrospective cohort studies, with a total of 864 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The indications for enterostomy (Creation of an artificial external opening or fistula in the intestines.) placement (A surgical procedure that places something in the human body.) and the baseline characteristics of the participants (age, co-morbidities, disease-severity) varied between studies. All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation) and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse). The effects of different surgical approaches on parastomal herniation (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.75; 10 studies, 864 participants; very low-quality evidence) and the occurrence of stomal prolapse (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.85; 1 study, 145 participants; very low-quality evidence) are uncertain. None of the included studies measured other stoma-related morbidity or stoma-related mortality. The present systematic review of randomized and non-randomized studies found inconsistent results between the two compared interventions regarding their potential to prevent (brand of veterinary medicine) parastomal herniation. In conclusion, there is still a lack of high-quality evidence to support the ideal surgical technique (The use of a laser either to vaporize surface lesions or to make bloodless cuts in tissue.) of stoma formation. The available moderate-, low-, and very low-quality evidence, does not support or refute the superiority of one of the studied stoma formation techniques over the other.",

In this update, we included 10 retrospective cohort studies with a total of 864 participants, and one randomized controlled trial (RCT: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to the treatment groups), including 60 participants. The target population was individuals, regardless of age, who received a temporary or permanent enterostomy for any reason in either the elective (planned) or the emergency setting. The results found inconclusive results between the two techniques for the risk of parastomal herniation (11 studies, 924 participants), stomal prolapse (1 study, 145 participants), ileus or stenosis (1 study, 60 participants), and skin irritation (1 study, 60 participants). Neither technique was found to be better than the other for any of the stoma-related outcomes of interest. None of the studies measured other stoma-related problems, or death. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate, low, or very low, because of high risk of bias, small sample sizes, few events, and diversity across studies. Based on the current knowledge presented in this review, there is no evidence to support the use of one stoma formation technique over the other. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect."

Overall, the quality of evidence from these studies was very low. There is not enough information or data to identify any real therapeutic difference between supportive therapy and standard care. There are several outcomes, including hospitalisation, satisfaction with treatment and general mental state, indicating advantages for other psychological therapies over supportive therapy. However, these findings are limited because they are based on only a few small studies where the quality of evidence is very low. There was very limited information to compare supportive therapy with family therapy and psychoeducation as most studies in this review focused on other psychological therapies, such as CBT. Apart from one study presenting data on death, there was no information on the adverse effects of supportive therapy.

We also wanted to know how many people had side effects, and how severe they were. In April 2017, we found 11 studies with 949 participants. They compared NSAID with NSAID, or NSAID with opioid drug (morphine or codeine). No studies looked at using NSAID together with an opioid-like morphine, which is how they are often used. The studies were small and of poor quality. They used different designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes important to people with cancer pain were often not reported. Many different NSAIDs were tested, and it was not possible to make sensible comparisons. With an NSAID, initially moderate or severe cancer pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in 1 in 4 (26%) to 1 in 2 (51%) people in four studies. Side-effect reporting was poor. Two serious side effects were reported with NSAIDs, and 22 deaths, but these were not related to pain treatment. Common side effects were thirst/dry mouth (1 in 7; 15%), loss of appetite (1 in 7; 14%), sleepiness (1 in 10; 11%), and heartburn (1 in 10; 11%). One in four people stopped taking NSAIDs because the drug did not work, and 1 in 20 stopped because of side effects. The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of an NSAID alone for treating cancer pain. We do not know whether using NSAIDs together with an opioid such as codeine or morphine is worthwhile."

Participants treated with tinzaparin (used with another drug, warfarin, to treat blood clots that form deep in the veins and to prevent new blood clots from forming.) had statistically significantly fewer hospitalisation days than participants in the group treated with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), with a mean difference of -4.98 days (95% confidence interval -5.48 to -4.48). Two minor bleeding events were reported as adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) in the tinzaparin (used with another drug, warfarin, to treat blood clots that form deep in the veins and to prevent new blood clots from forming.) group, and none were reported in the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group.

The most important reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence were serious risk of bias and imprecision (due to low sample size or low occurrence of events).

One study involved 253 people (aged approximately 22 years) with sickle cell disease and compared tinzaparin with placebo and people were selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The other study was smaller with 34 participants (aged approximately 27 years) and compared dalteparin versus placebo. Tinzaparin reduced the number of days spent in hospital and reduced the pain (and the intensity of the pain) more rapidly. Two minor bleedings were reported in the tinzaparin group versus none in the placebo group. The data regarding the effectiveness of dalteparin were very limited and only addressed pain intensity, being more reduced by treatment with dalteparin than by placebo. These data are not sufficient to support the conclusion that low-molecular-weight heparins are effective in the treatment of vaso-occlusive crises in people with sickle cell disease. Additional studies with different types of low-molecular-weight heparin used in different forms of sickle cell disease, are necessary to confirm or dismiss the results of this single study. Vaso-occlusive crises can be extremely debilitating and can have a significant impact on quality of life; therefore it is important to know whether low-molecular-weight heparins might serve as a useful treatment option with few side effects. The quality of the evidence for the majority of outcomes was very low, this had mainly to do with risk of bias of the studies (e.g. method of blinding unclear) or with small sample size of the studies."

For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable (Disease that cannot be measured directly by the size of the tumor but can be evaluated by other methods specific to a particular clinical trial.) populations) to moderate. We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) to be low. We did not find a difference between monotherapy (Pharmacotherapy consisting of a single agent.) and combination therapy (The treatment of a disease or condition by several different means simultaneously or sequentially.) for the treatment of people with VAP. Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy (Pharmacotherapy consisting of a single agent.) to multiple antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy (Pharmacotherapy consisting of a single agent.) for the empiric treatment of VAP. Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) choice for VAP, but carbapenem (replaced by a carbon atom.)s as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)s (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.).",

We analysed 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies looked at the use of one antibiotic treatment plan versus another, but these varied among studies. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants, and funding for many was provided by pharmaceutical companies and study authors were affiliated with these companies. We used statistical techniques to evaluate our results. For single versus multiple antibiotics, we found no difference in rates of death or cure, or adverse events. For our comparison of combination therapies with optional adjunctives we were only able to analyse clinical cure for one the antibiotics Tigecycline and imipenem-cilastatin for which imipenem-cilastatin was found to have higher clinica cure. We also looked at carbapenem (antibiotics used to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria) versus non-carbapenem treatment; we found no difference in death rate or adverse effects, but we found that carbapenems are associated with an increase in clinical cure. We assessed evidence quality as moderate for most outcomes, and very low for clinical cure when single-antibiotic treatment was compared with multiple antibiotic therapy. We also found that evidence quality was low for adverse events when carbapenem was compared with non-carbapenem treatment. We did not find differences between single and combination therapy, lending support to use of a single-antibiotic treatment plan for people with ventilator-associated pneumonia. This may not be applicable to all patients because studies did not identify patients who are at risk of exposure to harmful types of bacteria. We could not evaluate the best single-antibiotic choice to treat people with ventilator-associated pneumonia because there were too few studies, but carbapenems may achieve better cure rates than other tested antibiotics."

When policies targeted gastric-acid suppressant and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug classes (Anti-inflammatory agents that are non-steroidal in nature.), decreased drug use (Indication of drug use.) and substantial savings on drugs (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) occurred immediately and for up to two years afterwards, with no increase in the use of other health services (6 studies). Targeting second generation antipsychotic drugs (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.)

Relaxing restrictions for reimbursement of antihypertensives (Drugs used in the treatment of acute or chronic vascular HYPERTENSION regardless of pharmacological mechanism.) and statins (Compounds that inhibit HMG-CoA reductases.) increased appropriate use and decreased overall drug expenditures. Two studies which measured health outcomes directly were inconclusive. Implementing restrictions to coverage and reimbursement of selected medications (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) can decrease third-party drug spending without increasing the use of other health services (6 studies). Relaxing reimbursement rules for drugs (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) used for secondary prevention (The prevention of recurrences or exacerbations of a disease or complications of its therapy.) can also remove barriers (Something that blocks, prevents, separates, or limits.) to access. Policy design, however, needs to be based on research quantifying the harm and benefit profiles of target and alternative drugs (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) to avoid unwanted health system and health effects. Health impact evaluation should be conducted where drugs (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) are not interchangeable.

Where drugs have cheaper, effective alternatives and they target symptoms, this review found that reimbursement restriction polices can ensure better use of the medications with reduced costs and without an increase in the use of other health services, as would be expected if there were negative health effects of the restriction policies. Evaluation is required if alternative drugs are not effective substitutes. Removing restrictions for drugs that prevent complications of disease can result in an intended increase in their use as well as cost savings. When restrictions to reimbursement policies are designed using the best available evidence on the health impact of the medications, they support equitable access to the drugs that best support health by supporting the sustainability of publically subsidized drug plans.

There was substantial clinical heterogeneity amongst the studies and it was not deemed appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis. We summarised data by categorising similar interventions into comparison groups. Comparison 1: Any form of one-to-one OHA versus no OHA Four studies compared any form of one-to-one OHA versus no OHA. Two studies reported the outcome of gingivitis (Inflammation of gum tissue (GINGIVA) without loss of connective tissue.). Although one small study had contradictory results at 3 months and 6 months, the other study showed very low-quality evidence of a benefit for OHA at all time points (very low-quality evidence). The same two studies reported the outcome of plaque (A film that attaches to teeth, often causing DENTAL CARIES and GINGIVITIS.). There was low-quality evidence that these interventions showed a benefit for OHA in plaque (A film that attaches to teeth, often causing DENTAL CARIES and GINGIVITIS.) reduction at all time points. Two studies reported the outcome of dental caries (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) at 6 months and 12 months respectively. There was very low-quality evidence of a benefit for OHA at 12 months. Comparison 2: Personalised one-to-one OHA versus routine one-to-one OHA Four studies compared personalised OHA versus routine OHA. There was little evidence available that any of these interventions demonstrated a difference on the outcomes of gingivitis (Inflammation of gum tissue (GINGIVA) without loss of connective tissue.), plaque (A film that attaches to teeth, often causing DENTAL CARIES and GINGIVITIS.) or dental caries (Localized destruction of the tooth surface initiated by decalcification of the enamel followed by enzymatic lysis of organic structures and leading to cavity formation.) (very low quality). Comparison 3: Self-management versus professional OHA Five trials compared some form of self-management with some form of professional OHA. There was little evidence available that any of these interventions demonstrated a difference on the outcomes of gingivitis (Inflammation of gum tissue (GINGIVA) without loss of connective tissue.) or plaque (A film that attaches to teeth, often causing DENTAL CARIES and GINGIVITIS.)

There was insufficient high-quality evidence to recommend any specific one-to-one OHA method as being effective in improving oral health or being more effective than any other method. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are required to determine the most effective, efficient method of one-to-one OHA for oral health maintenance and improvement.

                "Authors from Cochrane Oral Health carried out this review and the evidence is up to date to 10 November 2017. We included research where individual patients received oral hygiene advice from a dental care professional on a one-to-one basis in a dental clinic setting with a minimum of 8 weeks follow-up. In total, within the identified 19 studies, oral hygiene advice was provided by a hygienist in eight studies, dentist in four studies, dental nurse in one study, dentist or hygienist in one study, dental nurse and hygienist in one study, and dental nurse oral hygiene advice to the control group with further self-administration of the intervention in one study. It was unclear in three of the studies which member of the dental team carried out the intervention. Over half of the studies (10 of the 19) were conducted in a hospital setting, with only five studies conducted in a general dental practice setting (where oral hygiene advice is largely delivered). Overall we found insufficient evidence to recommend any specific method of one- to-one oral hygiene advice as being more effective than another in maintaining or improving oral health. The studies we found varied considerably in how the oral hygiene advice was delivered, by whom and what outcomes were looked at. Due to this it was difficult to readily compare these studies and further well designed studies should be conducted to give a more accurate conclusion as to the most effective method of maintaining or improving oral health through one-to-one oral hygiene advice delivered by a dental care professional in a dental setting. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low due to problems with the design of the studies."

Most of the deaths were in participants taking high doses of oral corticosteroids. The review of trials concluded that lower doses of oral steroids and strong steroid creams seem safe and effective. However, the use of steroid creams in extensive disease may be limited by side-effects and the practicality of applying creams to large areas of the skin.

                "Traditional Chinese herbal medicine is a common practice in the East, and some clinical trials show a benefit of herbal medicines for symptomatic treatment of this condition. This systematic review identified and included 75 randomised clinical trials evaluating the effects of various herbal preparations (including single herbs or mixtures of different herbs) for treating people with irritable bowel syndrome. The review shows that some herbal medicines improve global symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and/or constipation. However, the methodological quality of the majority of clinical trials evaluating these herbs was generally poor. There is evidence indicating that small, poor quality trials with positive findings are more likely to be associated with exaggerated effects. Although the included trials did not report serious adverse effects from using herbal medicines more research is needed to determine the safety of herbal medicines. In conclusion, herbal medicines might be promising for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. However, it is premature to recommend herbal medicines for routine use in irritable bowel syndrome. Testing the herbs in larger, well-designed trials is needed in order to establish sound evidence for their use."

Other hormonal drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.)s appeared promising but most of them were not studied extensively.

The studies of pericoital LNG regimens provided promising results but many had serious methodological issues.\u00a0Most reports were decades old and provided limited information. However, we considered the evidence to be moderate quality because of the large number of participants from diverse populations, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results across studies. Rigorous research is still needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pericoital use of LNG as a primary means of contraception (Prevention of CONCEPTION by blocking fertility temporarily, or permanently (STERILIZATION, REPRODUCTIVE).) among women with infrequent intercourse.

We found 22 studies from the past 40 years. They included a total of 12,400 women in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Fifteen trials studied different doses of the hormone levonorgestrel and seven looked at other hormones. These studies showed that using some hormones right before or after sex did prevent pregnancy. Levonorgestrel seemed to work well, and was safe and accepted by thousands of women in several large trials. The most common side effects were menstrual bleeding problems. However, such bleeding issues were not always related to how often women took the pills or the total dose of the drug. Most studies were old and many reports were not complete. However, the data had moderate quality because of the many women in these studies, the low pregnancy rates, and the consistent results. We do not know for sure whether using levonorgestrel repeatedly around the time of sex is a good and safe method of birth control. More high-quality research is needed to answer the question."

The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. The age range of patients was commonly restricted to adolescents or young adults, however the participants of two studies were from a much wider age range (12 to 54 years). The distribution of males and females was similar in eight of the studies, with a predominance of female patients in seven studies. Eight studies were assessed to be at high overall risk of bias; six studies at unclear risk of bias; one study at low risk of bias. Ten studies with 407 randomised and 390 analysed patients compared surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) anchorage with conventional anchorage for the primary outcome of mesiodistal movement of upper first molars (The first, permanent, six-year molar of the lower left arch as defined by the Universal tooth numbering system.). We carried out a random-effects model meta-analysis for the seven studies that fully reported this outcome. There was strong evidence of an effect of surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) anchorage on this outcome. Compared with conventional anchorage, surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) anchorage was more effective in the reinforcement of anchorage by 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.27 mm to -1.09 mm; seven studies, 308 participants analysed) with moderate quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias, five studies at unclear risk of bias, one study at low risk of bias). This result should be interpreted with some caution, however, as there was a substantial degree of heterogeneity for this comparison. There was no evidence of a difference in overall duration of treatment between surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) and conventional anchorage (-0.15 years; 95% CI -0.37 years to 0.07 years; three studies, 111 analysed patients) with low quality of evidence (one study at high overall risk of bias and two studies at unclear risk of bias). Information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) and acceptability was limited and inconclusive. When direct comparisons were made between two types of surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) anchorage, there was a lack of evidence to suggest that any one technique was better than another. No included studies reported adverse effects. There is moderate quality evidence that reinforcement of anchorage is more effective with surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) anchorage than conventional anchorage, and that results from mini-screw implants (put in the body as a prosthesis, or for treatment or diagnosis.) are particularly promising. While surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) anchorage is not associated with the inherent risks and compliance issues related to extraoral headgear (a device intended for use in orthodontic treatment.), none of the included studies reported on harms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.) of surgical (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) or conventional anchorage.",

Fifteen studies were included in this review involving data from 561 participants. The studies were conducted in Europe, India, China, South Korea and the USA. Most took place in university settings or training hospitals and one in a specialist orthodontic practice. Most studies contained a similar number of males and females, however there were more females than males in five studies and only females in two. The age range varied from adolescents and young adults to adults up to the age of 54 years. All participants in the studies needed a course of orthodontic treatment with additional anchorage control. None of the studies reported adverse effects. When surgically implanted anchorage devices were compared to conventional anchorage devices, they were better in providing stabilisation for preventing unwanted movement in teeth during orthodontic treatment. There was limited information on patient-reported outcomes such as pain and how acceptable the devices were found to be. No information was reported on adverse events. The quality of the evidence for the important outcomes in this review ranged from moderate to low quality. The main shortcomings of all of the studies were related to issues with their design and the way they were carried out, with insufficient and low quality reporting of the study methods and outcomes."

Pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) was a secondary outcome in five of the eight identified studies.

This was apart from the two on cerebral palsy where pain relief occurred with the use of baclofen delivered via a catheter into the spinal cord. However the procedure to deliver this medication resulted in most side effect reported in these trials; this was swelling at the site of the catheter, and in one study it reported that this occurred in around half of the children (8/17). Five children also leaked spinal fluid from the catheter resulting in headache and nausea and, for two children, a prolonged hospital stay. The trials were limited by the quality of their methods and most did not set out to measure the benefit of the drug in reducing pain as a main focus. In conclusion, the evidence on pain treatment in children and young people with life-limiting health conditions is very limited, and only evaluated in participants with certain diseases and not for drug treatments primarily used to treat pain. The trials that were identified evaluated the drugs in small samples of children.

                "This review included seven studies (specifically randomised controlled trials), involving 735 people. The studies compared RIC with sham RIC or medical management in people with ischaemic stroke or at risk of ischaemic stroke. Three trials (involving 371 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for preventing ischaemic stroke, and another four trials (involving 364 people) were eligible for our analysis of RIC for treating ischaemic stroke. The included trials were carried out in China, Denmark, and the UK. The results of this review are current up to January 2018. In people with narrowing of arteries in the brain, RIC may reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. In people being treated with stenting (the insertion of a metal or plastic tube) for narrowed arteries in the neck, RIC may reduce the size of new brain injuries caused by reduced blood flow. However, its effect on clinical outcomes (stroke and death) was unclear. Adverse events were significantly more common in the RIC group but were not reported to be severe. Among people with acute ischaemic stroke (where it had only been several hours from symptom onset) who received clot-dissolving medicines, we found that RIC may increase the risk of death or dependency (needing help from others). We found no significant differences in the size of the final stroke. In people with acute ischaemic stroke and chronic blood vessel disease of the brain, RIC did not affect measures of nerve function, mood, or thinking ability. There is low-quality evidence which suggests that RIC may help prevent recurrent stroke in people with narrowed arteries in the brain, and may increase death or dependency in people with acute ischaemic stroke who received clot dissolving medication. The evidence is less clear for reducing the volume of the stroke (size of brain lesion caused by low blood flow). Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these findings."

In terms of statistically significant effects, some interventions improved condom-related behaviour and reduced the number of sexual partners, but none affected the frequency of sexual episodes. Effects of interventions on STIs were limited. None of the interventions appeared to be harmful. The methods used in the trials were not always well described making it difficult to tell whether their results may have been biased.

There may be no difference between groups in mean respiratory rate (MD 6.40, 95% CI -1.38 to 14.18) and mean heart rate (MD 14.50, 95% CI -8.49 to 37.49) at 20 minutes. The evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was of low quality, downgraded for serious imprecision. All children were discharged, but information on hospitalisation, intubation (Introduction of a tube into a hollow organ to restore or maintain patency if obstructed.), or re-presenting to emergency departments was not reported. In another study, 47 children with moderate croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.) received one dose of oral dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.) (0.3 mg/kg) with either heliox for 60 minutes or no treatment. Heliox may slightly improve croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.) scores at 60 minutes postintervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)

Children treated with heliox may have lower mean Taussig croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.) scores at 60 minutes (MD -1.11, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.17) but not at 120 minutes (MD -0.71, 95% CI -1.72 to 0.30).

There may be no difference in hospitalisation rates between groups (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.41). We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to imprecision and high risk of bias related to open-label design. Information on heart rate and intubation (Introduction of a tube into a hollow organ to restore or maintain patency if obstructed.) was not reported. In the third study, 29 children with moderate to severe croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.) received intramuscular dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.)

Heliox may slightly improve croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.) scores at 90 minutes postintervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), but may have little or no difference overall using repeated measures analysis. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes in this comparison as of low quality, downgraded due to high risk of bias related to inadequate reporting. Information on hospitalisation or re-presenting to the emergency department was not reported. The included studies did not report on adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.), intensive care admissions, or parental anxiety (Feelings or emotions of dread, apprehension, and impending disaster but not disabling as with ANXIETY DISORDERS.). We could not pool the available data because each comparison included data from only one study. Due to very limited evidence, uncertainty remains about the effectiveness and safety of heliox. Heliox may not be more effective than 30% humidified oxygen (An element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].) for children with mild croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.), but may be beneficial in the short term for children with moderate to severe croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.) treated with dexamethasone (An anti-inflammatory 9-fluoro-glucocorticoid.). The effect may be similar to 100% oxygen (An element with atomic symbol O, atomic number 8, and atomic weight [15.99903; 15.99977].) given with one or two doses of adrenaline (The active sympathomimetic hormone from the ADRENAL MEDULLA.). Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were not reported, and it is unclear if these were monitored in the included studies. Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in the treatment of children with moderate to severe croup (Inflammation involving the GLOTTIS or VOCAL CORDS and the subglottic larynx.).",

Heliox may be no more effective than 30% oxygen for children with mild croup; as effective as 100% oxygen given with one or two doses of adrenaline; and slightly more effective than no treatment for children with moderate to severe croup.

The prevalence of vertebral fracture in accident and emergency settings ranged from 6.5% to 11% and in primary care from 0.7% to 4.5%. There were 29 groups of index tests investigated however, only two featured in more than two studies. Descriptive analyses revealed that three red flags in primary care were potentially useful with meaningful positive likelihood ratios (LR+) but mostly imprecise estimates (significant trauma, older age, corticosteroid (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) use; LR+ point estimate ranging 3.42 to 12.85, 3.69 to 9.39, 3.97 to 48.50 respectively). One red flag in tertiary care appeared informative (contusion/abrasion; LR+ 31.09, 95% CI 18.25 to 52.96). The results of combined tests appeared more informative than individual red flags with LR+ estimates generally greater in magnitude and precision. The available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for LBP. Based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. When combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. From the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. It should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with LBP. Further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.",

A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) contributed to the meta-analyses.

We also observed that compared to intermittent inhaled corticosteroids, children grew slightly less with daily inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone (inhaled corticosteroids are known to affect growth), underlying the importance of using the safest and lowest effective dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We did not observe any significant group difference in the rate of withdrawals or adverse effects. These results do not provide firm conclusions, although the improvement in asthma control, lung function and airway inflammation would provide slightly greater support for the use of inhaled corticosteroids every day as compared to taking them only when symptoms get worse.

Diets involved increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing poultry and fish, higher nut and olive oil use, and some increases in cereals and legumes (e.g. beans), and less red meat, sugar, and salt. We looked particularly at three key outcomes: the risk of death, the risk of advanced kidney disease requiring dialysis, and quality of life. There were four studies involving people who have had a kidney transplant and three studies involving people treated with dialysis. After combining the available studies, it was uncertain whether making healthy diet changes prevented heart complications as most studies did not measure these. Diet changes may improve life quality. We did see that some risk factors for future disease, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, were lower following diet counselling or healthier eating. The quality of the included studies was often very low meaning we could not be sure that future studies would find similar results. We are very uncertain whether dietary changes improve well-being for people with kidney disease because the available research studies were not designed to learn about these. Diet changes may lower blood pressure and cholesterol, but the longer term impact of these effects on well-being is not proven. This means we still need large and good-quality research studies to help understand the impact of diet on the health of people with kidney disease."

Babies of mothers who were upright were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, however this was based on one trial (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89, one study, 200 women).

There is clear and important evidence that walking and upright positions in the first stage of labour reduces the duration of labour, the risk of caesarean birth (Extraction of the FETUS by means of abdominal HYSTEROTOMY.), the need for epidural, and does not seem to be associated with increased intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) or negative effects on mothers' and babies' well being. Given the great heterogeneity and high performance bias of study situations, better quality trials are still required to confirm with any confidence the true risks and benefits of upright and mobile positions compared with recumbent positions for all women.

Although many studies were not of high quality, and most of the women were low risk, they did show that the first stage of labour may be approximately one hour and twenty minutes shorter for women who are upright or walk around. As every contraction is potentially painful, and prolonged labour can be an overwhelming and exhausting process resulting in an increased need for medical intervention, this is a meaningful outcome for women. Indeed other important outcomes for women who were upright and mobile compared with lying down in bed included a reduction in the risk of caesarean birth, less use of epidural as a method of pain relief, and less chance of their babies being admitted to the neonatal unit. More research of better quality is still needed to validate these results for all women in labour. However, based on the results of this review we recommend that wherever possible, women should be encouraged and supported to use upright and mobile positions of their choice during first stage labour, as this may enhance the progress of their labour and may lead to better outcomes for themselves and their babies."

One trial compared surgery to remove the first rib (transaxillary first rib resection) with surgery in which the surgeon freed the nerves from surrounding tissues (neuroplasty) without removing a rib, in 55 people with the disputed type of TOS. The participants had not responded to non-surgical treatments. Average follow-up was 37 months. A second trial analyzed 19 people who underwent double-blinded provision of a single injection of BTX (muscle relaxant) into the scalene muscles of the neck, and 18 people in the placebo group who received no active injection, with follow-up at six weeks, three months and, critically for the purpose of this review, six months. There is very low quality evidence that removal of a rib reduced pain from 'disputed' TOS more than a neuroplasty procedure. We identified issues in study design that could have affected the outcome of the trial. There were no adverse effects in either group. There were no trials of surgery versus no treatment. The trial comparing the intervention of BTX injection with placebo provided moderate evidence that this procedure does not significantly reduce pain or disability scores long term, although there were no adverse events associated with the procedure over placebo. This systematic review demonstrated that there is not enough evidence that the established interventions for TOS are helpful in relieving pain. Until high quality, randomized clinical trials comparing the various interventions for TOS are performed, the decision whether to treat and the choice of appropriate treatment will have to be based on the preferences of the individual and health care provider.

GENEVA was conducted in 24 countries across the world and SCORE was conducted in the US. Both trials compared two different doses of steroid, but the investigators of the two trials used different steroidal agents and different methods of delivery (implant versus injection). Both trials received full or partial sponsorship from the manufacturer of the drugs. Neither trial provided sufficient evidence to determine whether steroids had improved visual acuity after six months of treatment. Due to the limited evidence, we are unable to determine reliably whether steroid implants improved vision in eyes with CRVO-ME. Although the SCORE trial showed that more eyes in the steroid injection groups had improvement in vision compared with eyes in the observation group, participants treated with steroids and those not treated with steroids both lost vision on average at eight months. The GENEVA investigators reported no difference in vision outcomes between participants treated with steroids and those not treated with steroids after six months of treatment; however the GENEVA study was not limited to participants with only CRVO-ME and included participants with other retinal disease. Both trials showed that patients treated with steroids were at increased risk for high eye pressure - requiring additional medications to lower the eye pressure - and developing cataracts. The overall quality of the evidence was low due to clinical differences between studies, incomplete information available to assess outcomes, and lack of masking which may lead to biased study results."

Lumbar epidural block (injected into the epidural space.) was given using 0.25% bupivacaine (A widely used local anesthetic agent.), 10 mg bolus and 5 mg each hour on continuous epidural infusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) for six hours. This study was at low risk of bias in three domains but was assessed to be high risk of bias in two domains due to lack of allocation concealment and blinding of women and staff, and unclear for random sequence generation and outcome assessor blinding. The included study did not report on any of this review's important outcomes. Meta-analysis was not possible. For the mother, these were: maternal death (death during pregnancy or up to 42 days after the end of the pregnancy, or death more than 42 days after the end of the pregnancy); development of eclampsia (Onset of HYPERREFLEXIA; SEIZURES; or COMA in a previously diagnosed pre-eclamptic patient (PRE-ECLAMPSIA).) or recurrence of seizures (Clinical or subclinical disturbances of cortical function due to a sudden, abnormal, excessive, and disorganized discharge of brain cells.); stroke (A group of pathological conditions characterized by sudden, non-convulsive loss of neurological function due to BRAIN ISCHEMIA or INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGES.); any serious morbidity: defined as at least one of stroke (A group of pathological conditions characterized by sudden, non-convulsive loss of neurological function due to BRAIN ISCHEMIA or INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGES.), kidney failure (A severe irreversible decline in the ability of kidneys to remove wastes, concentrate URINE, and maintain ELECTROLYTE BALANCE; BLOOD PRESSURE; and CALCIUM metabolism.), liver failure (Severe inability of the LIVER to perform its normal metabolic functions, as evidenced by severe JAUNDICE and abnormal serum levels of AMMONIA; BILIRUBIN; ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE; ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE; LACTATE DEHYDROGENASES; and albumin/globulin ratio.), HELLP syndrome (A syndrome of HEMOLYSIS, elevated liver ENZYMES, and low blood platelets count (THROMBOCYTOPENIA).) (haemolysis (The destruction of ERYTHROCYTES by many different causal agents such as antibodies, bacteria, chemicals, temperature, and changes in tonicity.), elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), disseminated intravascular coagulation (A disorder characterized by procoagulant substances entering the general circulation causing a systemic thrombotic process.), pulmonary oedema (Excessive accumulation of extravascular fluid in the lung, an indication of a serious underlying disease or disorder.). For the baby, these were: death: stillbirths (death in utero (The hollow thick-walled muscular organ in the female PELVIS.) at or after 20 weeks' gestation), perinatal deaths (stillbirths plus deaths in the first week of life), death before discharge from the hospital, neonatal deaths (death within the first 28 days after birth), deaths after the first 28 days; preterm birth (less than 37 weeks and 0 days gestational age.) (defined as the birth before 37 completed weeks' gestation); and side effects of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.).

The included study also reported a reduction in maternal diastolic arterial pressure. However, the change in maternal mean arterial pressure and systolic arterial pressure, which were the other reported outcomes of this trial, were not significantly different between the two groups. Currently, there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness, safety or cost of using epidural therapy for treating severe pre-eclampsia (Onset of HYPERREFLEXIA; SEIZURES; or COMA in a previously diagnosed pre-eclamptic patient (PRE-ECLAMPSIA).) (A complication of PREGNANCY, characterized by a complex of symptoms including maternal HYPERTENSION and PROTEINURIA with or without pathological EDEMA.) in non-labouring women. High-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the use of epidural agents as therapy for treatment of severe pre-eclampsia (Onset of HYPERREFLEXIA; SEIZURES; or COMA in a previously diagnosed pre-eclamptic patient (PRE-ECLAMPSIA).) (A complication of PREGNANCY, characterized by a complex of symptoms including maternal HYPERTENSION and PROTEINURIA with or without pathological EDEMA.). The rationale for the use of epidural is well-founded. However there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to show that the effect of epidural translates into improved maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, there is a need for larger, well-designed studies to come to an evidence-based conclusion as to whether the lowering of vasomotor tone by epidural therapy results in better maternal and fetal outcomes and for how long that could be maintained. Another important question that needs to be answered is how long should extended epidural be used to ensure any potential clinical benefits and what could be the associated side effects and costs. Interactions with other modalities of treatment and women's satisfaction could represent other avenues of research.",

They were randomly assigned to an epidural block plus their other medications or a drug to treat their high blood pressure plus their other medications. After six hours of treatment they all underwent a caesarean section. The included study did not report on any of the important outcomes of interest in this review such as death of the mother, death of her baby (before or after being born), serious illness for the mother or her baby, the mother developing eclampsia or seizures, or side effects of the intervention. The study authors did report difference in the infant Apgar scores between the two groups The study authors also reported a clear drop in the diastolic blood pressure in the epidural group compared to the other group. Systolic and mean blood pressures were similar in the two groups of women. However, the study did not report on any other mother or baby outcomes of interest in this review. There is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to evaluate the use of epidural therapy in severe pre-eclampsia to improve outcomes for the mother or her baby. High-quality trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and cost of epidural therapy in severe pre-eclampsia. Future studies could report on important outcomes such as those listed in this review."

All trials but one were at overall high risk of bias, which means that there is possibility of drawing wrong conclusions, exaggerating benefits, or underestimating harms of glucocorticosteroids because of the way the trials were conducted and analysed. We could not determine whether glucocorticosteroids had a positive or negative effect on people with alcoholic liver disease. Despite available data on outcomes which included mortality, health-related quality of life, and serious complications, we were unable to draw firm conclusions mainly because available data were still insufficient to produce robust results, trials were small, and the included participants differed in severity of disease. Therefore, we have very little confidence in our conclusions."

Included studies were at a low risk of bias for the majority of domains, with a high/unclear risk of bias identified in the areas of: performance (participants not blinded to allocation), and attrition (incomplete outcome data due to withdrawal) bias.

Corticosteroid (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment.

Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) and attrition bias.

Time to the next COPD (A disease of chronic diffuse irreversible airflow obstruction.) exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).)

The effect on knowledge was not statistically different between the two groups immediately and 3 months after the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). The level of reported enjoyment was higher in the game-based group.

Eight randomised studies (reporting on 475 participants) were included in the review. We found no reliable evidence of any robust differences between lithium and antidepressants but nor could we reliably exclude the possibility of clinically significant differences. In this review some studies included a mixed group of participants with either bipolar or unipolar disorder. The review suggests that, while lithium may be of benefit in preventing relapse in unipolar affective disorder, there remains uncertainty about the treatment effect in comparison with antidepressants.

Two studies compared parent-mediated intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s versus TAU (being studied for its ability to protect against the gastrointestinal side effects caused by fluorouracil.); the third compared a parent-mediated plus clinician-mediated intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) versus a clinician-mediated intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) alone. Treatment duration varied from 12 weeks to six months. One study provided nine group sessions and four individualised home-based sessions over a 13-week period. Another study provided weekly, individual clinic-based or home-based sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours, over a six-month period. The third study provided one 2- to 3-hour group session followed by bi-weekly, individual clinic-based sessions plus once-weekly home-based sessions for 12 weeks. Because of the different study designs and outcome measures used, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. We judged all three studies to be at high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants (not possible due to the nature of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)) and blinding of outcome assessors, and at an unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment. We judged one study to be at unclear risk of selection bias, as authors did not report the methods used to generate the random sequence; at high risk of reporting bias, as they did not report on one assessed outcome; and at high risk of detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) bias, as the control group had a cointervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)

The sample sizes of each included study were very small, meaning that they are unlikely to be representative of the target population. The finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.)s from the three included studies were inconsistent. Two studies found no differences in expressive or receptive language abilities between the groups, whether measured by direct assessment or parent reports. However, they did find that children in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group could use more targeted vocabulary items or utterances with language targets (Systems for the delivery of drugs to target sites of pharmacological actions.) in certain contexts postintervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)

This review highlights the need for well-designed studies, including RCTs, to evaluate the effectiveness of parent-mediated intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. Trials should use valid, reliable and similar measures of language development, and they should include measures of secondary outcomes more distal to the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), such as family well-being.

Two studies were randomised controlled trials: experiments in which children were allocated to treatment (i.e. parent-mediated) and control (treatment as usual or clinician-mediated, or both) groups using a random method such as a computer-generated list of random numbers. The other study reported that randomisation took place but did not specify how this was done. Two studies compared parent-mediated intervention to treatment as usual. One of these lasted for 13 weeks, and parents in the intervention group received nine, weekly group sessions and four individual sessions in the home. The total intervention time was approximately 26.5 hours. A second study lasted for six months, and parents received weekly, 1.5- to 2-hour clinic or home-based, individualised, parent-child sessions. The total intervention time was approximately 48 hours. A third study compared a parent- and clinician-mediated intervention to a clinician-only-mediated intervention. In this study the parents in the intervention group took part in a two- to three-hour interactive workshop plus three individualised sessions (two clinic-based and one home-based) every week for 12 weeks. The control group received the same individualised sessions, but a clinician delivered them (i.e. there was no parental involvement). The total intervention time was approximately 19 hours. A grant from the Hospital for Sick Children Foundation (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) funded one study. Another received partial funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education in the USA. The remaining study did not specify any funding sources. Two of the three studies found no differences in children's language ability after parent training. However, these same two studies found that children in the intervention group used more words that had been specifically targeted, postintervention; this was not maintained 12 months later. The study that gave parents the largest amount of intervention reported gains on general measures of overall language ability for children in the intervention group. One study did not find any changes in levels of parental stress immediately or up to 12 months postintervention in either group. All three studies noted changes in how parents talked to and interacted with their children immediately postintervention, and most strategies were retained by the intervention group 12 months later. One study reported increases in the socialisation skills of children who received the intervention. No study reported language attrition in either group postintervention. We rated the quality of the evidence in this review as very low, as only three studies fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, and all had small sizes and serious methodological limitations.

Further randomised clinical trials are needed to definitely understand the effect of physical exercise in adults after heart valve surgery. Given that the included studies are relatively old, and included narrowly-selected trial populations, the evidence is likely to be of limited applicability to clinical practice. Both trials had a high risk of bias (systematic errors) and the quality of the evidence was low. Due to the scarcity of the evidence there is also a high risk that the results may be subject to random errors (play of chance).

From the six trials involving 137 participants, we found there was insufficient evidence to determine how much of an effect there is from tDCS in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes regarding reduction in off time (when the symptoms are not controlled by the medication) and on time with dyskinesia (time that symptoms are controlled but the person still experiences involuntary muscle movements) , and for improving health- related quality of life, disability, and impairment in patients with IPD. However, tDCS may improve impairment regarding motor symptoms in patients with IPD. We found no study examining the effects of tDCS for improving activities of daily living. Proportions of adverse events and people discontinuing the study were comparable between groups. All findings are based on evidence of very low quality. That means that we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect."

We did not find evidence that LASB was better than placebo in reducing pain, or that it provided additional pain relief when added to rehabilitation. While a number of small studies compared LASB to other treatments, most did not find that LASB was better. One small study found that injecting the thoracic (upper back) sympathetic nerves with local anaesthetic and steroid was better than injecting the same drugs just under the skin at one-year follow-up, but the study may have been prone to bias. Only six studies reported on the type and amount of side effects. These studies reported only minor side effects, but since some studies did not report this information we can draw no firm conclusions about the safety of LASB. The evidence was mostly of low or very low quality. Overall, the evidence is limited, conflicting, and of low quality. While we cannot draw strong conclusions, the existing evidence is not encouraging."

                "We identified 14 trials, which included 2488 participants with mild, moderate, or severe one-sided Bell's palsy of unknown cause. Participants were aged from 14 to 84 years. The trials compared: - antivirals plus corticosteroids to corticosteroids alone or in combination with placebo; - antivirals alone or in combination with placebo to placebo or no treatment; - antivirals alone or in combination with placebo to corticosteroid treatment alone or in combination with placebo; or - antivirals plus corticosteroids to placebo or no treatment. For the majority of the studies, no information on funding was given. The remaining were mostly partly public funded, and one trial was funded by a pharmaceutical company. Eleven studies had high or uncertain risk of bias from various factors that can systematically affect trial results. We chose to base our conclusions only on data from three studies at a lower risk of bias. The review showed that there may be no clear difference in rates of incomplete recovery from Bell's palsy after treatment with the combination of antivirals and corticosteroids, compared to corticosteroids alone. This finding was of low certainty and was based on data from three trials involving 766 people with Bell's palsy of various degrees of severity. We excluded data from 10 trials with multiple potential sources of bias. However, we can be moderately confident that the combined therapy reduced the number of people left with long-term effects of Bell's palsy (excessive tearing of the eyes or an abnormal facial movement) compared to corticosteroid treatment alone. Data from two studies (98 participants) showed that in people with severe Bell's palsy (complete or almost complete facial paralysis), combined antivirals and corticosteroids had no clear effect on recovery compared with corticosteroid treatment alone. Corticosteroids alone were more effective than antivirals alone on rates of incomplete recovery (667 participants, 2 trials); antivirals and corticosteroids combined were more effective than placebo or no treatment (658 participants, 2 trials); and there was no clear benefit from antivirals alone over placebo (658 participants, 2 trials). Although, based on data from two trials (656 participants), we found no clear difference in the occurrence of side effects between people receiving both antivirals and corticosteroids, compared to those receiving corticosteroids alone, this evidence is too uncertain for us to draw conclusions. Large studies in people with Bell's palsy comparing additional antiviral agents may be indicated in the future."

Six studies compared iNO started when babies were less sick against waiting to see if they deteriorated, then treating them later. These studies were smaller, and only one was a high-quality trial. Inhaled nitric oxide is safe and can help some full-term babies with respiratory failure who have not responded to other methods of support. Inhaled nitric oxide increases levels of oxygen in babies' blood, and babies are more likely to survive without needing ECMO, a highly invasive therapy with many complications. Unfortunately, benefits of iNO are not clear in babies whose respiratory failure is due to a diaphragmatic hernia. Inhaled nitric oxide has shown no short-term or long-term adverse effects. No signs suggest that iNO given earlier is more beneficial or results in more babies treated, and the number who die or who need ECMO is not significantly reduced."

There is still a need for high quality randomised trials on the effectiveness of lumbar supports. One of the most essential issues to tackle in these future trials seems to be the realization (A feeling of altered reality characterized by a feeling of unreality, or being unreal.) of an adequate compliance.

                "In one study (82 people), back supports added to back school (patient education about recovering from back pain) were helpful in reducing the number of days of sick leave but not in preventing back pain. Back supports plus usual medical care reduced the number of days of low-back pain and improved function, but did not reduce sick leave (one study, 360 people). Treatment:  In four studies (1170 people), there was little or no difference between patients with acute or chronic back pain who used back supports and those who received no treatment in short-term pain reduction or overall improvement. There is conflicting evidence (two studies, 550 people) about whether back supports are better than nothing in helping low-back pain patients return to work faster, however in three studies (410 patients), they were better than nothing in helping individuals with subacute and chronic low-back pain recover function in the short term. In three studies (954 people), there was little or no difference in short-term pain reduction, overall improvement and return-to-work between those who used back supports and those who received manipulation, physiotherapy, or electrical stimulation. One study (164 people) reported mixed results on whether back supports improved function more than massage and in another study (19 people), use of a lumbar corset with back support was more effective in reducing pain in the short-term than a corset alone. Conclusions from this review should be viewed with caution due to the low quality of many of the studies. In the future, researchers should report side effects from wearing back supports and measure how many hours per day the supports are actually worn."

The total number of participants enrolled was unclear, as some studies did not provide this information. Most studies enrolled participants from the age of 18, including patients in intensive care units (ICU), oncology units and patients receiving long-term total parenteral nutrition (via solutions administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or by some other non-alimentary route.). There were low or unclear risks of bias in the included studies, except for blinding, which was impossible in most studies due to the catheters (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.) that were being assessed having different appearances. Overall, catheter impregnation significantly reduced catheter-related blood stream infection (Infections resulting from the use of catheters.) (CRBSI), with an ARR (The determination of the ratio of the aldosterone compared to renin activity present in a sample.) of 2% (95% CI 3% to 1%), RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.74) and NNTB of 50 (high-quality evidence). Catheter impregnation also reduced catheter colonization, with an ARR (The determination of the ratio of the aldosterone compared to renin activity present in a sample.) of 9% (95% CI 12% to 7%), RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.76) and NNTB of 11 (moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to substantial heterogeneity). However, catheter impregnation made no significant difference to the rates of clinically diagnosed sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.13; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded due to a suspicion of publication bias), all-cause mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07; high-quality evidence) and catheter-related local infections (Infections resulting from the use of catheters.) (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07; 2688 catheters (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.), moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to wide 95% CI). In our subgroup analyses, we found that the magnitudes of benefits for impregnated (A type of solid pharmaceutical dose form consisting of a material onto or into which active substance(s) are absorbed for subsequent release after administration, often over an extended period of time.) CVCs varied between studies that enrolled different types of participants. For the outcome of catheter colonization, catheter impregnation conferred significant benefit in studies conducted in ICUs (RR 0.70;95% CI 0.61 to 0.80) but not in studies conducted in haematological and oncological units (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.11) or studies that assessed predominantly patients who required CVCs for long-term total parenteral nutrition (via solutions administered intravenously, subcutaneously, or by some other non-alimentary route.) (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.34). However, there was no such variation for the outcome of CRBSI. The magnitude of the effects was also not affected by the participants' baseline risks. There were no significant differences between the impregnated (A type of solid pharmaceutical dose form consisting of a material onto or into which active substance(s) are absorbed for subsequent release after administration, often over an extended period of time.) and non-impregnated (A type of solid pharmaceutical dose form consisting of a material onto or into which active substance(s) are absorbed for subsequent release after administration, often over an extended period of time.) groups in the rates of adverse effects, including thrombosis/thrombophlebitis (Inflammation of a vein associated with a blood clot (THROMBUS).), bleeding (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.), erythema (Redness of the skin produced by congestion of the capillaries.) and/or tenderness (A dull achy pain.) at the insertion (A surgical procedure that places something in the human body.) site. This review confirms the effectiveness of antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) CVCs in reducing rates of CRBSI and catheter colonization. However, the magnitude of benefits regarding catheter colonization varied according to setting, with significant benefits only in studies conducted in ICUs. A comparatively smaller body of evidence suggests that antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) CVCs do not appear to reduce clinically diagnosed sepsis (Systemic disease associated with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms or their toxins in the blood.) or mortality significantly. Our findings call for caution in routinely recommending the use of antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)-impregnated (A type of solid pharmaceutical dose form consisting of a material onto or into which active substance(s) are absorbed for subsequent release after administration, often over an extended period of time.) CVCs across all settings.

                "We included 57 studies with 16,784 catheters and 11 types of antimicrobial impregnation. The total number of participants was not clear as some studies did not provide this information, and some participants may have had more than one CVC in the course of their treatment. The participants were mostly adults aged 18 and over in ICUs, cancer units or other healthcare settings in which CVCs were used for intravenous treatment or nutrition. All studies were completed when the participants left the unit or hospital, and no study followed up participants in the long-term. Twenty-six out of 57 studies were funded fully or partially by the catheter manufacturers or distributors, two studies were government-funded, and two received no funding. Funding sources were not stated in the remaining 27 studies. Compared to those participants given non-impregnated catheters, participants with impregnated catheters had 2% lower rates of bloodstream infections that were definitely catheter-related (CRBSI) (average absolute reduction in CRBSI: 2%). There was also a 9% lower chance of finding bacteria on these impregnated catheters (catheter colonization) (average absolute reduction in catheter colonization: 9%). However, the benefits of these catheters in reducing catheter colonization varied according to study setting, with significant benefits observed only in studies conducted in the ICUs. There were no clinically significant differences in the overall rates of bloodstream infections (clinically-diagnosed sepsis) or in death, although these outcomes were assessed in fewer studies than CRBSI and catheter colonization. Impregnated catheters appeared no more likely than non-impregnated catheters to cause adverse effects such as bleeding, clots, pain or redness at the insertion site. The amount of information in this review contributed to high-quality evidence for the major outcomes of CRBSI, all-cause mortality and adverse effects. However, for clinically-diagnosed sepsis we considered the quality of the evidence to be moderate, as we suspected that there had been selective non-publication of certain trials. We considered the quality of evidence to be moderate for catheter colonization too, due to major inconsistencies in the direction of the results amongst the included studies. While impregnated catheters are effective in reducing CRBSI and catheter colonization, particularly in ICUs, they may not be effective across all settings. Furthermore, our review shows that these impregnated catheters do not appear to reduce all bloodstream infections and numbers of deaths. The discrepancy between the findings for CRBSI, catheter colonization and overall bloodstream infections might be related to the limitations of the catheter and blood cultures that were used in most studies for detecting catheter-related infections. Future research should include overall bloodstream infections and death as key outcomes, and include some advanced methods for detecting micro-organisms on the catheters and in the bloodstream to evaluate the presence of catheter-related infections more accurately."

The studies had overall high risk of bias for 11 studies and only four RCTs had moderate risk of bias. Overall, the evidence was complex to report, with a wide range of outcome measures reported.

                "Nutritional methods (interventions) to improve infant and young children's growth have not been comprehensively or systematically assessed for urban slums. We included 15 studies in the review, involving 9261 children less than five years old and 3664 pregnant women. About 73% of children were less than one year old. The interventions provided maternal education; nutrient supplementation of mothers, infants, and children; improving nutrition systems; or a combination of these but not dietary modification. The reliability of the studies was very low to moderate overall because studies were not designed to cope with research problems linked to urban slum communities, such as high mobility and high loss of participants to follow-up. This meant that the effectiveness of the intervention could not be properly assessed at later dates. We assessed the effect of interventions taking both statistical and clinical significance into account. Where intervention outcomes were statistically insignificant, we conclude there was 'unclear effect'. There was no effect of giving mothers nutrient supplementation on birth weight and length, there were inconclusive results for nutrient supplementation in infants and children on improving children's height or stunting status, there was a positive impact on birth weight of maternal education interventions where there was a positive difference in birth weight of 478 g in infants exposed to the intervention, and inconclusive results of improving health systems that support nutrition on children's stunting status and a positive effect on height. There were no reported side effects from these interventions. The review showed the need to better understand urban slum environments and their people as evidence showed that interventions included in this review were successful in other locations outside of urban poor areas. More evidence is needed of the effects of multi-sectorial interventions, combining nutrition-specific and sensitive methods and programmes, as well as the effects of 'up-stream' practices and policies of governmental, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and the business sector to improve low birth weight and stunting in poor urban environments."

The study that compared etoricoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of IBD after 12 weeks of treatment. Although this study documented side effects experienced by the participants these side effects were not reported in the study manuscript. The study that compared celecoxib to placebo found no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who experienced exacerbation of ulcerative colitis after two weeks of treatment. The proportion of patients who experienced side effects was similar in the celecoxib and placebo groups (21% and 17%, respectively). No patients in either group died or experienced serious side effects. Eleven percent of patients in the celecoxib and placebo groups experienced GI side effects including increased stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and inflamed mucosa. No patients experienced any cardiovascular side effects (i.e. heart attack or stroke). Renal toxicity (i.e. the poisonous effect of a substance on the kidneys) or thrombotic side effects (i.e. the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel) were not reported. The results of the two included studies in this review suggest that celecoxib and etoricoxib do not exacerbate IBD symptoms. However, it should be noted that both studies assessed relatively small numbers of patients and were of short duration. Futhermore, the overall quality of the evidence from the studies was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results. No firm conclusions on the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib can be drawn from these studies. Further studies are needed to determine the tolerability and safety of celecoxib and etoricoxib in patients with rheumatological manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease."

The randomised controlled trial data on the effectiveness and safety of topical antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for diabetic foot ulcers (Lesion on the surface of the skin of the foot, usually accompanied by inflammation.) (A lesion on the surface of the skin or a mucous surface, produced by the sloughing of inflammatory necrotic tissue.) is limited by the availability of relatively few, mostly small, and often poorly designed trials. Based on our systematic review and analysis of the literature, we suggest that: 1) use of an antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) dressing (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) instead of a non-antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) dressing may increase the number of diabetic foot ulcers (Lesion on the surface of the skin of the foot, usually accompanied by inflammation.) (A lesion on the surface of the skin or a mucous surface, produced by the sloughing of inflammatory necrotic tissue.) healed over a medium-term follow-up period (low-certainty evidence); and 2) there is probably little difference in the risk of adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) related to treatment between systemic antibiotics (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)

For each of the other outcomes we examined there were either no reported data or the available data left us uncertain as to whether or not there were any differences between the compared treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.). Given the high, and increasing, frequency of diabetic foot wounds, we encourage investigators to undertake properly designed randomised controlled trials in this area to evaluate the effects of topical antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for both the prevention (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) and the treatment of infection (An illness caused by an infectious agent or its toxins that occurs through the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent or its products from an infected individual or via an animal, vector or the inanimate environment to a susceptible animal or human host.) in these wounds and ultimately the effects on wound healing.",

                "In August 2016 we searched for randomised controlled trials involving the use of any antimicrobial treatment on foot ulcers or other open wounds of the foot in people with diabetes. We found 22 trials involving a total of over 2310 adult participants (one trial did not report the number of participants). Participant numbers in each trial ranged from 4 to 317 and follow-up times during and after treatment ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. Some trials included participants with ulcers that were infected, while other trials included participants with ulcers that were uninfected. The trials compared a variety of different antimicrobial dressings, solutions, gels, creams, or ointments. Many of the trials did not report important data, which means the reliability of the results is uncertain. The results of five trials involving 945 participants suggest that use of some type of antimicrobial dressing may increase the number of ulcers healed in medium-term follow-up (4 to 24 weeks) when compared with a non-antimicrobial dressing (low certainty evidence). Due to limited information, we were unable to assess the effectiveness of treatments in either preventing or resolving wound infection. Four trials involving 937 participants compared systemic antibiotics (given by mouth or via injection, distributed to the whole body by the bloodstream) with antimicrobial treatments applied directly to the wound. These trials did not provide data on healing or infection, but it appeared that there was no difference in the side effects experienced by participants whose ulcers were treated systemically or topically (moderate certainty evidence). Overall, the certainty of the evidence provided by the trials was too low for us to be certain of the benefits and harms of topical antimicrobial treatments for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes. More, larger, and better-designed randomised controlled trials should be carried out in this area."

Vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.) caused an increased incidence of acute LRTI (An acute or chronic, viral or bacterial infectious process that affects the lower respiratory tract.) in one study; an increase in cough (A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation.) and fever (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.); and increased symptoms of cough (A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation.) and rapid breathing in two other studies. Three reported no differences and no protective effect of vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.). Two studies reported that vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.) significantly reduced the incidence of acute LRTI (An acute or chronic, viral or bacterial infectious process that affects the lower respiratory tract.) in children with poor nutritional status or weight, but increased the incidence in healthy children. This unexpected result is outside our current understanding of the use of vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.) for preventing (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) acute LRTI (An acute or chronic, viral or bacterial infectious process that affects the lower respiratory tract.)s. Accordingly, vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.) should not be given to all children to prevent acute LRTI (An acute or chronic, viral or bacterial infectious process that affects the lower respiratory tract.)s. Despite its benefits in preventing (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) diarrhoeal illnesses, vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.) supplementation (Adding nutrients to the diet.) has only a limited effect in preventing (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) acute LRTI (An acute or chronic, viral or bacterial infectious process that affects the lower respiratory tract.)s. Positive effects appear limited to populations with acute and chronic under nutrition. Low-dose vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.) appears to have fewer side effects and at least equal benefit to a high dose of vitamin A (Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response.).",

Studies measured different aspects (for example, what constituted 'acute LRTI', the time to symptom resolution, etc.). There may have been other treatments (especially of malnourished children) which could have led to bias. Most studies showed no significant benefit of vitamin A supplements on the incidence or prevalence of symptoms of acute LRTIs. Although no included studies addressed adverse effects of vitamin A, the use of vitamin A should be carefully monitored. We do not recommend giving vitamin A to all children to prevent acute LRTIs because a few studies unexpectedly found that vitamin A increased the chance of infections or worsened symptoms in otherwise healthy children. Some evidence shows benefit for vitamin supplements given to children with low serum retinol or with a poor nutritional status. Limitations of our review include trials conducted within very specific populations and poor methodological quality of some of the included trials."

Due to the lack of data on adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) in one of the studies' arms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.), a formal meta-analysis was not performed for this outcome. Data from two trials seemed to show no difference in quality of life, although this finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.) was not supported by a formal analysis due to the differences in both the scores used and the way the data were reported. Data from two studies seemed to show a trend towards a reduction in syncope relapse (A transient loss of consciousness and postural tone caused by diminished blood flow to the brain (i.e., BRAIN ISCHEMIA).)s after diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) in participants implant (put in the body as a prosthesis, or for treatment or diagnosis.)ed (put in the body as a prosthesis, or for treatment or diagnosis.) with ILR (located in the vicinity of 16p11 and approximately 48 kb in length.).

The mean cost per diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) and the mean cost per arrhythmic diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) were lower for participants randomised to ILR (located in the vicinity of 16p11 and approximately 48 kb in length.) implant (put in the body as a prosthesis, or for treatment or diagnosis.).

No conclusive data were available on the other end-points analysed. Further trials evaluating the effect of ILR (located in the vicinity of 16p11 and approximately 48 kb in length.)s in the diagnostic strategy of people with recurrent unexplained syncope are warranted. Future research should focus on the assessment of the ability of ILR (located in the vicinity of 16p11 and approximately 48 kb in length.)s to change clinically relevant outcomes, such as quality of life, syncope relapse (A transient loss of consciousness and postural tone caused by diminished blood flow to the brain (i.e., BRAIN ISCHEMIA).) and costs.",

This review includes evidence identified up to April 2015. All-cause mortality (death from any cause) was no different in people who received the ILR. Loop recorders do not seem to change quality of life, although people with ILR had a significantly higher rate of diagnosis compared to participants in the standard assessment group. Moreover, data seem to show a trend towards a reduction in syncope recurrences after diagnosis in people implanted with ILR. Finally, costs were higher in the group of participants in which the ILR was implanted but the cost per diagnosis and the cost to diagnose an arrhythmia were much lower for participants randomised to ILR implant. There was low quality evidence that ILR does not change mortality if compared to a standard diagnostic assessment of people with syncope. There was moderate quality evidence that ILR increases the rate of diagnosis if compared to a standard diagnostic assessment. Future research is needed in order to clarify if ILRs can improve quality of life and reduce syncope recurrences and costs. All the included studies were funded: two of them by scientific societies, the remaining were partially supported by the ILR's manufacturers."

Participants were randomised to aspiration (Procedure using suction, usually with a thin needle and syringe, to remove bodily fluid or tissue.) and sclerotherapy (Treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, gastric and esophageal varices, and peptic ulcer hemorrhage by injection or infusion of chemical agents which cause localized thrombosis and eventual fibrosis and obliteration of the vessels.) (155 patients with 159 hydroceles) and surgery (120 patients with 123 hydroceles). All studies were assessed as having low or unclear risk of bias for selection bias, detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) bias, attrition bias and selective reporting bias. Blinding was not possible for participants and investigators based on the type of interventions. Blinding for statisticians was not reported in any of included studies. There were no significant difference in clinical cure between the two groups (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.10), however there was significant heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 95%). On further investigation one study contributed all of the heterogeneity. This could be due to the agent used or perhaps due to the fact that this is a much older study than the other two studies included in this analysis. When this study was removed from the analysis the heterogeneity was 0% and the result was significant (in favour of surgery) (2 studies, 136 participants: RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.85).There was a significant increase in recurrence in those who received sclerotherapy (Treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, gastric and esophageal varices, and peptic ulcer hemorrhage by injection or infusion of chemical agents which cause localized thrombosis and eventual fibrosis and obliteration of the vessels.) compared with surgery (3 studies, 196 participants: RR 9.37, 95% CI 1.83 to 48.4). One study reported a non-significant decrease in fever (An abnormal elevation of body temperature, usually as a result of a pathologic process.) in the sclerotherapy (Treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, gastric and esophageal varices, and peptic ulcer hemorrhage by injection or infusion of chemical agents which cause localized thrombosis and eventual fibrosis and obliteration of the vessels.) group (60 participants: RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.08). There was an increased number of infections (The invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents and their multiplication, as well as the reaction by the host to these organisms and/or toxins that the organisms produce.) in the surgery group however this increase was not statistically significant (4 studies, 275 participants): RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.05; I\u00b2 = 0%). Three studies reported the frequency of pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) in the surgery group was higher than aspiration (Procedure using suction, usually with a thin needle and syringe, to remove bodily fluid or tissue.) and sclerotherapy (Treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, gastric and esophageal varices, and peptic ulcer hemorrhage by injection or infusion of chemical agents which cause localized thrombosis and eventual fibrosis and obliteration of the vessels.) group but because of different measurement tools applied in these studies, we could not pool the results. Radiological cure was not reported in any of the included studies. There was no significant difference in haematoma (A collection of blood outside the BLOOD VESSELS.) formation between the two groups (3 studies, 189 participants: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.90; I\u00b2 = 0%). Only one study reported patient satisfaction at three and six months; there was no significant difference between the two groups. Postoperative complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) as well as cost and time to work resumption were less in the aspiration (Procedure using suction, usually with a thin needle and syringe, to remove bodily fluid or tissue.) and sclerotherapy (Treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, gastric and esophageal varices, and peptic ulcer hemorrhage by injection or infusion of chemical agents which cause localized thrombosis and eventual fibrosis and obliteration of the vessels.) group; however the recurrence rate was higher. The cure rate in short-term follow-up was similar between the groups, however there is significant uncertainty in this result due to the high heterogeneity. There is a great need for further methodologically rigorous RCTs that assess the effectiveness of different type of sclerosant agents, sclerosing (A pathological process consisting of hardening or fibrosis of an anatomical structure, often a vessel or a nerve.) solution concentration and injection volume for the treatment of hydrocoeles. It is important that the RCTs have sufficiently large sample size and long follow-up period. Studies should evaluate clinical outcomes such as pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), recurrence, satisfaction, complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) and cure using validated instruments.

However, the mean change in night time cough diary scores significantly favoured the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.83, P = 0.02).

It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.)s.) based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia (A congenital or acquired condition of underdeveloped or degeneration of CARTILAGE in the TRACHEA.). For those with less severe disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.), RCTs on interventions such as antibiotics (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) and chest physiotherapy (Exercises to provide postural drainage of lungs) are clearly needed. Outcomes of these RCTs should include measurements of the trachea (The cartilaginous and membranous tube descending from the larynx and branching into the right and left main bronchi.) and physiological outcomes in addition to clinical outcomes.",

We found only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) that assessed nebulised recombinant human deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase) which helps in breaking down the mucous and has been shown to be useful in aiding airway clearance in cystic fibrosis compared to placebo (no active treatment) in children with both tracheomalacia and a concurrent respiratory infection. This trial showed no evidence of benefit in terms of the number of children who were cough-free two weeks after treatment. Also, there was less coughing reported, both during the day and at night, in the group who did not receive the intervention - however these differences were not statistically significant. With the lack of evidence, the routine use of any therapies for intrinsic tracheomalacia cannot be recommended given the cost of nebulised rhDNase and the likely harmful effect. The decision to subject a child to any surgical or medical based therapies will have to be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio for each individual situation. It is unlikely that any RCT on surgically based management will ever be available for children with severe life-threatening illness associated with tracheomalacia.

Fourteen studies evaluated forms of cognitive behavioural therapy (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.)

(mindfulness), psychodynamic therapies, and integrative therapy. Fifteen included studies compared the studied psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list. Five studies compared the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) to enhanced or structured care. Only one study compared cognitive behavioural therapy (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) with behaviour therapy (The application of modern theories of learning and conditioning in the treatment of behavior disorders.). Across the 21 studies, the mean number of sessions ranged from one to 13, over a period of one day to nine months. Duration of follow-up varied between two weeks and 24 months. Participants were recruited from various healthcare settings and the open population. Duration of symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)s, reported by nine studies, was at least several years, suggesting most participants had chronic symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)s (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) at baseline. Due to the nature of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), lack of blinding of participants, therapists, and outcome assessors resulted in a high risk of bias on these items for most studies. Eleven studies (52% of studies) reported a loss to follow-up of more than 20%. For other items, most studies were at low risk of bias. Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were seldom reported. For all studies comparing some form of psychological therapy with usual care or a waiting list that could be included in the meta-analysis, the psychological therapy resulted in less severe symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)s at end of treatment (SMD -0.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53 to -0.16; 10 studies, 1081 analysed participants). This effect was considered small to medium; heterogeneity was moderate and overall quality of the evidence was low. Compared with usual care, psychological therapies resulted in a 7% higher proportion of drop-outs during treatment (RR acceptability 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99; 14 studies, 1644 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Removing one outlier study reduced the difference to 5%. Results for the subgroup of studies comparing CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) with usual care were similar to those in the whole group. Five studies (624 analysed participants) assessed symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) severity comparing some psychological therapy with enhanced care, and found no clear evidence of a difference at end of treatment (pooled SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; considerable heterogeneity; low-quality evidence). Five studies (679 participants) showed that psychological therapies were somewhat less acceptable in terms of drop-outs than enhanced care (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; moderate-quality evidence). When all psychological therapies included this review were combined they were superior to usual care or waiting list in terms of reduction of symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.) severity, but effect sizes were small. As a single treatment, only CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) has been adequately studied to allow tentative conclusions for practice to be drawn. Compared with usual care or waiting list conditions, CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) reduced somatic symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)s (Persistent health symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)s which remain unexplained after a complete medical evaluation.), with a small effect and substantial differences in effects between CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) studies. The effects were durable within and after one year of follow-up. Compared with enhanced or structured care, psychological therapies generally were not more effective for most of the outcomes. Compared with enhanced care, CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) was not more effective. The overall quality of evidence contributing to this review was rated low to moderate. The intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) groups reported no major harms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.). However, as most studies did not describe adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) as an explicit outcome measure, this result has to be interpreted with caution. An important issue was that all studies in this review included participants who were willing to receive psychological treatment. In daily practice, there is also a substantial proportion of participants not willing to accept psychological treatments for somatoform disorders (Disorders having the presence of physical symptom (An indication that a person has a condition or disease.)s that suggest a general medical condition but that are not fully explained by another medical condition, by the direct effects of a substance, or by another mental disorder.) or MUPS. It is unclear how large this group is and how this influences the relevance of CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) in clinical practice. The number of studies investigating various treatment modalities (other than CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.)) needs to be increased; this is especially relevant for studies concerning physical therapies (The use of exercises and physical activities to help condition muscles and restore strength and movement.). Future studies should include participants from a variety of age groups; they should also make efforts to blind outcome assessors and to conduct follow-up assessments until at least one year after the end of treatment.",

                "We rated the quality of current research as low to moderate. Fourteen out of the 21 studies focused on cognitive behavioural therapy, which is a specific form of talking therapy based on the idea that thoughts and thinking can influence emotions and behaviours. Cognitive behavioural therapy was more effective than usual care in reducing the severity of MUPS. For other types of therapy, we found only one or two studies giving insufficient evidence for conclusions. Cognitive behavioural therapy was no more effective than enhanced care provided by the person's doctor. No studies of physical therapy met the criteria to be included in the review. Talking therapies were acceptable to people and few people dropped out of the trials; however, this may not reflect real clinical practice as the study participants were people with somatoform disorders or MUPS who were willing to try talking therapies. In clinical practice, a high proportion of people may not be willing to accept these treatments. The review authors suggest that future high-quality trials should be carried out to find out more about which groups of people benefit most from cognitive behavioural therapy and how it can be most effectively delivered. They also suggest that more studies are needed of other talking therapies, and a particular focus should be on high-quality studies of physical therapies."

However, evidence synthesis of two RCTs also favoured the infusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) of intravenous local anaesthetics (A blocking of nerve conduction to a specific area by an injection of an anesthetic agent.) for the prevention (In medicine, action taken to decrease the chance of getting a disease or condition.) of PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.) three to six months after breast cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.) surgery with an OR of 0.24 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence). We did not synthesize evidence for the surgical subgroups of limb amputation, hernia repair (Surgical procedures undertaken to repair abnormal openings through which tissue or parts of organs can protrude or are already protruding.), cardiac surgery (Surgery performed on the heart.) and laparotomy (Incision into the side of the abdomen between the ribs and pelvis.). We could not pool evidence for adverse effects because the included studies did not examine them systematically, and reported them sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered evidence synthesis. High risk of bias from missing data and lack of blinding across a number of included studies reduced our confidence in the findings. Thus results must be interpreted with caution. We conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia (Injection of an anesthetic into the nerves to inhibit nerve transmission in a specific part of the body.) may reduce the risk of developing PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.) after three to 18 months after thoracotomy (Surgical incision into the chest wall.) and three to 12 months after caesarean section (Extraction of the FETUS by means of abdominal HYSTEROTOMY.). There is low-quality evidence that regional anaesthesia (Injection of an anesthetic into the nerves to inhibit nerve transmission in a specific part of the body.) may reduce the risk of developing PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.) three to 12 months after breast cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.) surgery. There is moderate evidence that intravenous infusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) of local anaesthetics (A blocking of nerve conduction to a specific area by an injection of an anesthetic agent.) may reduce the risk of developing PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.) three to six months after breast cancer (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.) surgery. Our conclusions are considerably weakened by the small size and number of studies, by performance bias, null bias, attrition and missing data. Larger, high-quality studies, including children, are needed. We caution that except for breast surgery, our evidence synthesis is based on only a few small studies. On a cautionary note, we cannot extend our conclusions to other surgical interventions (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) or regional anaesthesia (Injection of an anesthetic into the nerves to inhibit nerve transmission in a specific part of the body.) techniques, for example we cannot conclude that paravertebral block (injected in the paravertebral space, in the vicinity of the thoracic spinal nerves, resulting in ipsilateral somatic and sympathetic nerve blockade within the chest or abdomen.) reduces the risk of PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.) after thoracotomy (Surgical incision into the chest wall.).

We found 63 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with participants undergoing open chest, heart, breast, abdominal, vascular, gynaecological and other surgery, but not orthopaedic surgery. RCTs are studies where people are allocated by chance to one or the other of different treatments being studied. The studies included only adults, and were mostly conducted in Europe and North America, with some from China, Egypt and Brazil. The types of surgery included surgery with a high event rate of persistent pain after surgery, such as breast surgery, limb amputation and opening the chest, and surgery with a lower risk but high numbers of procedures, such as caesarean section. We were able to pool results from 39 RCTs enrolling a total of 3027 participants for our inclusive analysis. Follow-up was for 1293 participants at three months, 1365 participants at six months, 326 participants at 12 months, and 43 participants at 20 or more months after surgery. The RCTs did not report surgical and anaesthetic complications consistently and little information was available on these. The studies were mostly funded by the institutions conducting the studies. Regional anaesthesia reduced the number of people who experienced persistent pain after undergoing non-orthopaedic surgery. For open chest surgery, giving an epidural halved the odds of a person having persistent postoperative pain at three to 18 months after surgery (7 RCTs, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Seven people needed to be treated in this way for one to benefit. For the prevention of persistent pain three to 12 months after breast cancer surgery, seven people needed regional anaesthesia for one to benefit (18 RCTs, 1297 participants, low-quality evidence). Infusion of local anaesthetic into a vein was shown to reduce the risk of persistent pain three to six months after breast surgery (2 RCTs, 97 participants, moderate-quality evidence), with three people needing to be treated for one to benefit. Regional anaesthesia reduced the odds by more than half of a woman experiencing persistent pain after caesarean section (4 RCTs, 551 participants, moderate-quality evidence). The number of women treated for one to benefit was 19. Continuous local anaesthetic infusion of the site where bone tissue was obtained from the hip bone did not clearly reduce the number of people with persistent pain at three to 55 months (3 RCTs, 123 participants, low-quality evidence). We could not synthesize evidence for limb amputation, hernia repair, cardiac or abdominal surgery because of differences in how treatment was given or how results were reported. We found consistent evidence supporting the use of regional anaesthesia in adults to prevent persistent pain after a number of types of surgery. However, we observed variations in the effect sizes, and at different times after surgery. Some studies could not be blinded to the treatment received and our results are affected by the small number of studies and participants, and the loss to follow-up of participants over time. The evidence was therefore of low or moderate quality."

The long-term use of these drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.)s has not been assessed. Adverse event (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) data were scarce, except for olanzapine (A drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) used to treat certain mental disorders.). There was a possible increase in self-harming behaviour, significant weight gain, sedation and changes in haemogram parameters with olanzapine (A drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.) used to treat certain mental disorders.). A significant decrease in body weight was observed with topiramate (A sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide with anticonvulsant property.) treatment.

Total BPD (A personality disorder marked by a pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.) severity was not significantly influenced by any drug (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.). No promising results are available for the core BPD (A personality disorder marked by a pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.) symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance (Imbalance in the ability to distinguish between the self and the non-self) and abandonment.

                "Available studies tested the effects of antipsychotic, antidepressant and mood stabiliser treatment in BPD. In addition, the dietary supplement omega-3 fatty acid (commonly derived from fish) which is supposed to have mood stabilising effects was tested. Twenty-eight studies covering 1742 study participants were included. The findings tended to suggest a benefit from using second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and omega-3 fatty acids, but most effect estimates were based on single study effects so repeat studies would be useful. Moreover, the long-term use of these drugs has not been assessed. The small amount of available information for individual comparisons indicated marginal effects for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. The data also indicated that there may be an increase in self-harming behaviour in patients treated with olanzapine. In general, attention must be paid to adverse effects. Most trials did not provide detailed data of adverse effects and thus could not be considered within this review. We assumed their effects were similar to those experienced by patients with other conditions. Available data of the studies included here suggested adverse effects included weight gain, sedation and change of haemogram parameters with olanzapine treatment, and weight loss with topiramate. Very few beneficial effects were identified for first-generation antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, they may be helpful in the presence of comorbid problems that are not part of BPD core pathology, but can often be found in BPD patients. There are only few study results per drug comparison, with small numbers of included participants. Thus, current findings of trials and this review are not robust and can easily be changed by future research endeavours. In addition, the studies may not adequately reflect several characteristics of clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods)."

Analyses of three cross-over trials yielded suboptimal results because they were based on between-group differences rather than individual participants' differences for sequential intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s. Two parallel-group trials had limited clinical value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheter (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.)s (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.) and the other provided data for only four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but there were difficulties with recruitment and maintaining participants in this study. The included studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary (The transfer of a neoplasm from one organ or part of the body to another remote from the primary site.) outcome measures. None of the trials addressed: number of catheter (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.)s (used to carry fluids into or from a blood vessel, hollow organ, or body cavity.) used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) and ease of use), or health status/measures of psychological health; very limited data were collected for health economic outcomes. Trials assessed only three of the eight intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) comparisons identified.

There were very few small trials that met the review inclusion criteria. The high risk of bias of the included studies resulted in the evidence being graded as low or very low quality. Data from seven trials that compared different washout policies were limited, and generally, of poor methodological quality or were poorly reported. The evidence was not adequate to conclude if washouts were beneficial or harmful (The use of a drug for a reason other than which it was intended or in a manner or in quantities other than directed.).

We found substantial differences between studies in cancer diagnosis (General term for detecting and classifying cancer in patients.) (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.), cancer treatment (Any intervention for management of a malignant neoplasm.), age of participants, questionnaires used to assess fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.), and sample size. All included studies scored at least one 'Risk of bias' item as unclear or high risk. We identified both clinical and statistical heterogeneity and therefore could not pool results, so we present them descriptively. Eighteen studies (describing 14,573 survivors) reported the prevalence of severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.), which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. In a subgroup of three studies including children aged up to 18 years at fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) assessment (268 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. In comparison, in a subgroup of 12 studies including participants aged 16 and over (13,952 survivors), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. The prevalence of severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) in a subgroup of survivors of haematological cancer was presented in seven studies and ranged from 1.8% to 35.9% (1907 survivors). Prevalence of severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) in brain cancer (Neoplasms of the intracranial components of the central nervous system, including the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, thalamus, brain stem, and cerebellum.) survivors was presented in two studies (252 survivors) and was 14.6% and 21.1% respectively. One study presented a prevalence for bone cancer (cancer that forms in cells of the bone.) survivors of 0.0% (17 survivors). Four studies provided prevalence rates of severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) in control groups of siblings or population-based controls, which ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.)d than controls, but this difference was statistically significant in only two studies. Studies assessing risk and associated factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.) for fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) were heterogeneous, and definitions of the factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.) under study were often inconsistent, with results therefore presented descriptively. They found that depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.) might be associated with fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.). In contrast, age at diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) and education level did not seem to be associated with fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.). We were unable to calculate any overall risk estimate for any of the reported risks and associated factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.), because we could not conduct meta-analysis. One study provided information about the course of fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years, 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.). It is unclear how many childhood cancer (A malignant tumor that occurs in children.) survivors suffer from severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.). This review encountered several difficulties. We found statistical and clinical heterogeneity and great variation in the reporting of possible risk and associated factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.). The evidence in this review is therefore weak, and the exact prevalence of severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) after treatment for childhood cancer (A malignant tumor that occurs in children.) remains to be determined. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) following treatment and the strength of the relationship between fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) and associated and risk factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.). Despite these limitations, our review does provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature about severe fatigue (The state of weariness following a period of exertion, mental or physical, characterized by a decreased capacity for work and reduced efficiency to respond to stimuli.) after treatment for childhood cancer (A malignant tumor that occurs in children.).",

Eighteen studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue, which ranged from 0% to 61.7%. Four studies reported a prevalence of severe fatigue in the patient's brothers and sisters or in population-based controls. Prevalence rates in these control groups ranged from 3.1% to 10.3%. In these four studies, survivors were more often fatigued than controls. This difference was only significant in two studies. When we looked at the prevalence of severe fatigue in survivors of lymphoma and leukaemia (types of blood cancers), we found that they ranged from 1.8% to 35.9%. Two studies reported on severe fatigue in brain cancer survivors, with rates of 21.13% and 14.6%. One study in bone cancer survivors reported no cases of severe fatigue. For survivors aged 18 and younger, prevalence rates ranged from 6.7% to 12.5%. By contrast, in studies including participants aged 16 years and over (but mostly over 18), prevalence rates ranged from 4.4% to 61.7%. Twenty-two studies assessed one or more possible risk factors for fatigue. Our review shows that depression might increase fatigue. The age at cancer diagnosis and the education level of the survivor did not seem to influence fatigue. Only one study provided information about the course of fatigue over time, and found that over the course of 2.7 years 32 of the 102 participants (31.4%) reported persistent severe fatigue. All included studies had problems with the quality of the evidence, and we found many differences between studies for several characteristics. The evidence to address our review question is therefore weak. The occurrence of severe fatigue after treatment for childhood cancer remains uncertain. This is also the case for the course of severe fatigue after completion of cancer treatment and the risk factors that might be responsible for developing fatigue."

Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on the live birth rate.

(0.5 mg/kg/week). Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. We found that rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) treatment may improve some of the pulmonary function outcomes but there was no difference between standard and high-dose (Radiotherapy using radioactive particles that deposit a high amount of energy by radiation per unit length of travel.) levels (low-quality evidence, limited by inconsistency across the trials, small number of participants and short duration of therapy). The trials show evidence of improvement in the anthropometric parameters (height, weight and lean body mass) with rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) therapy, again no differences between dose levels. We found improvement in height for all comparisons (very low- to low quality evidence), but improvements in weight and lean body mass were only reported for standard-dose rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) versus no treatment (very low-quality evidence). There is some evidence indicating a change in the level of fasting blood glucose with rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) therapy, however, it did not cross the clinical threshold for diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of diabetes in the trials of short duration (low-quality evidence). There is low- to very low-quality evidence for improvement of pulmonary exacerbations (An acute episode of worsening pulmonary symptoms related to cystic fibrosis.) with no further significant adverse effect (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)s, but this is limited by the short duration of trials and the small number of participants. One small trial provided inconsistent evidence on improvement in quality of life (very low-quality evidence). There is limited evidence from three trials in improvements in exercise capacity (low-quality evidence). None of the trials have systematically compared the expense of therapy on overall healthcare costs. When compared with no treatment, rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) therapy is effective in improving the intermediate outcomes in height, weight and lean body mass. Some measures of pulmonary function showed moderate improvement, but no consistent benefit was seen across all trials. The significant change in blood glucose levels, although not causing diabetes, emphasizes the need for careful monitoring of this adverse effect (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) with therapy in a population predisposed to CF-related diabetes. No significant changes in quality of life, clinical status or side-effects (Disorders that result from the intended use of PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS.) were observed in this review due to the small number of participants. Long-term, well-designed randomised controlled trials of rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) in individuals with CF are required prior to routine clinical use of rhGH (A recombinant form of endogenous human growth hormone (GH), a polypeptide produced by the anterior lobe of the human pituitary gland.) in CF.",

It includes eight trials with 291 individuals with CF being selected for one treatment or the other randomly. The individuals in the trials were five to 23 years old, but most had not yet reached puberty. Six trials lasted for one year and two trials for six months. Treatment with rhGH was compared to no treatment in seven trials and to a placebo (a liquid that did not contain any growth hormone) in one trial. The trial that used a placebo compared it to two different doses of rhGH treatment. Results showed a modest improvement in height, weight and lean body mass between six and 12 months. However, there was no consistent evidence that rhGH treatment improves lung function, muscle strength, or quality of life. The trials were small and we did not find any evidence on changes in glucose metabolism or the long-term risk of diabetes due to the treatment. Given these results, we are not able to identify any clear benefit of therapy and believe that more research from well-designed, adequately powered clinical trials is needed. We did not have enough information to decide if overall the trials were biased in a way that might affect the results. All the measured outcomes were clearly reported in the trials, but the trials were small, and did not have enough participants to show a difference that may not have been due to chance. We also had concerns that outcomes which were based on personal judgement, such as quality of life scores, might be affected because those taking part in seven of the trials were able to tell which group they were in."

Reduction of exposure was achieved by limiting use of the agent, improving ventilation, or using protective equipment in the same job; by changing to another job with intermittent exposure; or by implementing education programs. For continued exposure, 56 per 1000 workers reported absence of symptoms at follow-up, the decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of a reference value (FEV1 (the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity.) %) was 5.4% during follow-up, and the standardized change in non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (Tendency of the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree to contract more intensely in response to a given stimulus than it does in the response seen in normal individuals.) (NSBH) was -0.18. In 18 studies, authors compared removal (removed.) from exposure to continued exposure. Removal (removed.) may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) symptoms, with risk ratio (RR) 4.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 13.86), and it may improve asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) symptoms, with RR 2.47 (95% CI 1.26 to 4.84), compared to continued exposure. Change in FEV1 (the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity.) % may be better with removal (removed.) from exposure, with a mean difference (MD) of 4.23 % (95% CI 1.14 to 7.31) compared to continued exposure. NSBH may improve with removal (removed.) from exposure, with standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.43 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.82). In seven studies, authors compared reduction of exposure to continued exposure. Reduction of exposure may increase the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 2.65 (95% CI 1.24 to 5.68). There may be no considerable difference in FEV1 (the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity.) % between reduction and continued exposure, with MD 2.76 % (95% CI -1.53 to 7.04) . No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH. In ten studies, authors compared removal (removed.) from exposure to reduction of exposure. Following removal (removed.) from exposure there may be no increase in the likelihood of reporting absence of symptoms, with RR 6.05 (95% CI 0.86 to 42.34), and improvement in symptoms, with RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.47), as well as no considerable change in FEV1 (the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity.) %, with MD 2.58 % (95% CI \u22123.02 to 8.17). However, with all three outcomes, there may be improved results for removal (removed.) from exposure in the subset of patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. No studies reported or enabled calculation of change in NSBH. In two studies, authors reported that the risk of unemployment after removal (removed.) from exposure may increase compared with reduction of exposure, with RR 14.28 (95% CI 2.06 to 99.16). Four studies reported a decrease in income of 20% to 50% after removal (removed.) from exposure. The quality of the evidence is very low for all outcomes. Both removal (removed.) from exposure and reduction of exposure may improve asthma (A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.) symptoms compared with continued exposure. Removal (removed.) from exposure, but not reduction of exposure, may improve lung function compared to continued exposure. When we compared removal (removed.) from exposure directly to reduction of exposure, the former may improve symptoms and lung function more among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents. Removal (removed.) from exposure may also increase the risk of unemployment. Care providers should balance the potential clinical benefits of removal (removed.) from exposure or reduction of exposure with potential detrimental effects of unemployment. Additional high-quality studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace interventions for occupational asthma (Asthma attacks caused, triggered, or exacerbated by OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE.)

                "The review is based on 26 studies that included 1,695 participants with occupational asthma. Sensitizers caused nearly all cases. We focused on the interventions of removal from exposure and reduction of exposure, which were compared with continued exposure. Outcomes were changes in asthma symptoms, lung function, and non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity between baseline and follow-up. What are the main results of the review? Both removal from exposure and reduction of exposure may improve asthma symptoms when compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure, but not reduction of exposure, may improve lung function when compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure may improve symptoms and lung function more than reduction of exposure among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents, but removal may also increase the risk of unemployment. Consequently, the benefit of a better improvement has to be weighed against the potential for a higher risk of job loss. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of interventions at reducing the impact of occupational asthma. How up-to-date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published through 31July 2019."

Resolution of tophi - 33 more people out of 100 had resolution of one or more tophi after six months' treatment with pegloticase biweekly compared with placebo (33% absolute improvement). - 14 more people out of 100 had resolution of one or more tophi after six months' treatment with pegloticase monthly compared with placebo (14% absolute improvement). - 40 people out of 100 in the biweekly pegloticase group had resolution of one or more tophi. - 21 people out of 100 in the monthly pegloticase group had resolution of one or more tophi. - 7 people out of 100 in the placebo group had resolution of one or more tophi. Other outcomes were for all participants, and not separated out for those people with tophi. Therefore, we have not reported them in this review. However, we reported on withdrawal due to adverse events for the total population. Most withdrawals were due to adverse reactions to drug infusion. Withdrawal due to adverse events - 16 more people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with biweekly pegloticase compared with placebo (16% more withdrawals). - 17 more people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with monthly pegloticase compared to placebo (17% more withdrawals). - 18 people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with biweekly pegloticase due to adverse events. - 19 people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with monthly pegloticase due to adverse events. - 2 people out of 100 withdrew from treatment with placebo due to adverse events. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that pegloticase biweekly or monthly probably resolves one or more tophi. However, this has to be weighed up against high withdrawal rates from treatment due to adverse events, mostly due to an increase in infusion reactions. Pain reduction, quality of life, serum urate normalisation and function were not reported separately in people with tophi. The evidence was downgraded due to imprecise results. Further research may change these results. We do not know if other interventions, including surgery, are effective, as we found no randomised controlled trials that assessed other interventions."

                "Womb (uterine/endometrial) cancer is a fairly common disease affecting approximately 1 in 70 women. A hysterectomy is usually curative because most cancers have a low risk of spreading (metastasising) to other sites which may result in a later recurrence. Microscopic examination of the hysterectomy specimen can tell doctors if there is a high risk of the cancer returning and this allows women to decide if they want further preventative treatment (adjuvant therapy) to reduce the risk. Chemotherapy can increase cure rates for other types of high-risk cancer after initial surgery and this review examines the effectiveness of chemotherapy for primary womb cancer after hysterectomy. Data from nine high quality randomised clinical trials involving up to 2197 women were subjected to systematic statistical modelling. This shows that chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrent disease, lengthens the duration women have before a metastasis is diagnosed and improves survival rates. There are many ways to examine the data. The subset analysis that excluded old fashioned drug regimens suggests that chemotherapy reduces the risk of being dead at any nominated time by a quarter. The number of women who would need to have need chemotherapy to prevent one death depends on the type of cancer. In these trials, one woman was cured for every 25 women treated with high dose platinum based chemotherapy after hysterectomy. This is an absolute risk reduction of 4%. Chemotherapy is associated with a greater survival advantage than radiotherapy and has added value when used with radiotherapy. It also appears to reduce the absolute risk of developing a recurrence outside the pelvis by about 5%. This would benefit one woman in every 20 treated. However, chemotherapy has side effects, risks and temporarily reduces a woman's quality of life. In many cases, the small reduction in the cancer recurrence risk may not be worth the side effects of adjuvant treatment."

None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care. The quality of evidence varied between subgroups and outcomes, most notably the evidence for combined surgery and low-dose postoperative 5-FU (an antineoplastic antimetabolite.) was found to be very low using GRADE. The combined surgery postoperative 5-FU (an antineoplastic antimetabolite.) subgroup because no surgical failures have been reported and the sample size is small (n = 118), and the low-dose postoperative 5-FU (an antineoplastic antimetabolite.) group because of the small sample size (n = 76) and high risk of bias of the only contributing study. Postoperative injections of 5-FU (an antineoplastic antimetabolite.) are now rarely used as part of routine packages (Containers, packaging, and packaging materials for drugs and BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS.) of postoperative care but are increasingly used on an ad hoc basis. This presumably reflects an aspect of the treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment that is unacceptable to both patients and doctors.

                "This is a summary of a Cochrane review that looked at the effect of using one of these drugs, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We gathered evidence from 12 trials involving 1319 participants. The evidence is current to July 2013. For patients who have never had eye surgery before, 5-FU injections after surgery can slightly reduce the pressure in the eye after one year and also the risk of having more surgery in the first year. For patients having both cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery at the same time, no difference has been detected between injections and no injections. Some people are at higher risk of having problems following trabeculectomy, for instance people that have had previous surgery on the eye. For this group, the 5-FU injections can reduce the pressure in the eye a little and also reduce the risk of having more surgery in the first year. Only one study has investigated the effect of using lower than normal doses in the injections. No benefit was found when compared to a control group who had no injections. If 5-Fluorouracil was applied to the eye during the surgery, there was less chance of having to have more surgery within the year and the pressure in the eye was also reduced slightly at one year. Complications such as damage to cells at the front of the eye or a leak from the wound seem more common when 5-FU is used. The methodological quality of the trials was not high in general. In many of the studies that contributed to the evidence about 5-FU after glaucoma surgery the researchers were aware of whether the participant had received the dummy injection or the 5-FU injection. This may have introduced bias into the results. Importantly the only study contributing information about low dose 5-FU was of low methodological quality so our conclusions on low dose 5-FU must be cautious. The studies that contributed evidence about 5-FU during surgery was largely very good, the studies were designed and reported to a standard we would expect of modern trials. We concluded that the main benefit is for people at high risk of problems. There may be a smaller benefit for people at low risk of problems if 5-FU is given either as injections after surgery or during the operation. However, 5-FU was found to increase the risk of serious complications and so may not be worthwhile for the small benefit gained."

Pooled analysis of all studies using data presented closest to a cut-off of 3.3 indicated that sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94); specificity 0.66 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75); the positive likelihood ratio was 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.6) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.22). There was a statistically significant difference in test (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) accuracy between the general hospital setting and the specialist memory setting (P = 0.019), suggesting that IQCODE performs better in a 'general' setting. We found no significant differences in the test (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) accuracy of the short (16-item) versus the 26-item IQCODE, or in the language of administration. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies, including a highly varied prevalence of dementia (The presence of dementia in an individual younger than age sixty five.) (10.5% to 87.4%). Across the included papers there was substantial potential for bias, particularly around sampling (the selection and implementation of statistical observations in order to estimate properties of an underlying population; also, in environmental science, the collection of representative specimens analyzed to characterize site conditions.) of included participants and selection criteria, which may limit generalisability. There was also evidence of suboptimal reporting, particularly around disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) severity and handling indeterminate results, which are important if considering use in clinical practice. The IQCODE can be used to identify older adults in the general hospital setting who are at risk of dementia (The presence of dementia in an individual younger than age sixty five.) and require specialist assessment; it is useful specifically for ruling out those without evidence of cognitive decline (Loss of previously present mental abilities, generally in adults.). The language of administration did not affect test (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) accuracy, which supports the cross-cultural use of the tool. These findings are qualified by the significant heterogeneity, the potential for bias and suboptimal reporting found in the included studies.",

                "We searched electronic databases of published research studies, looking for all studies of IQCODE in a hospital setting. We searched from the first available papers in scientific databases up to and including January 2013. We found 13 relevant studies which had results suitable to be combined in a single analysis. Of these papers, six (1352 participants) described studies conducted in \u201cspecialist\u201d services such as memory clinics or wards. Three papers (566 participants) described studies conducted in general older adult services and four studies (827 participants) included both specialist and general services. Summarising the available papers, we found that IQCODE was useful for 'ruling out' possible dementia in the general hospital setting. This means if a person has a low score on IQCODE testing they probably do not have dementia. IQCODE was less useful in specialist memory clinics and psychiatry wards. We also found that a short version of the IQCODE gave similar results to the traditional longer version. As part of our assessment we looked at whether the design of the available studies was suitable for the study question. We found several instances where the design of the study could be improved. For example, seven of the thirteen studies only included a selection of all the people attending the service who could have been assessed with IQCODE. We also looked at how well researchers reported the conduct and results of their studies. Again, there were many instances where the reporting could be improved. A common issue was not describing the severity of memory and thinking problems in those thought to have dementia, only reported in three of the included studies. In summary, IQCODE may be a useful tool for assessing adults for possible dementia. There are still a number of unanswered questions around how useful IQCODE may be in hospital settings. For example, before we start using IQCODE routinely we need to describe if it is practical and acceptable to hospital staff, to patients and to their carers. The review was performed by a team based in research centres in the UK (Glasgow, Leicester, Oxford). We had no external funding specific to this study and we have no conflicts of interest that may have influenced our assessment of the research data."

We found many of the publications had poor quality of reporting and had small numbers of participants. However, there does seem to be evidence from this review that the drug sulphonylurea (like glibenclamide or glyburide, gliclazide) could make patients insulin dependent sooner and it does not control blood sugar as well as insulin. Therefore, this suggests that this drug should not be a first line treatment for patients with LADA. In addition, insulin combined with vitamin D, or Chinese herbs may maintain natural insulin production better than insulin alone. Similarly, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) may maintain natural insulin production. However, there was no conclusive evidence that any of the other remaining treatment methods were better than each other. Studies on oral agents or insulin reported no adverse events in terms of severe hypoglycaemic attacks. This review represents very early days of our understanding of the best way to treat LADA. It is limited by the poor reporting quality of the studies, small sample sizes, no clear single definition of LADA and many of the studies being carried out in different ethnic groups (China, Japan, Cuba, UK, Sweden) with different clinical care systems.  None of the publications reported on complications of diabetes, health-related quality of life, costs or health service utilisation. All but one of the publications reported there were no deaths.  In summary, this review demonstrates that insulin treatment may be preferable compared to sulphonylurea treatment but there is little evidence regarding other forms of treatment. Future studies are needed, should have a clear definition of LADA, investigate patient-important outcomes and use a common method of measuring stimulated C-peptide (a marker of natural insulin production reflecting improved beta-cell function of the pancreas)."

In 43 of the trials, the social norms intervention was targeted at higher-risk students. 55 trials were conducted in the USA, with others form Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Delivery of social norms information included mailed feedback, web/computer feedback, individual face-to-face feedback, group face-to-face feedback and general social norms marketing campaigns across college campuses. Over the longer-term, after four or more months of follow-up, there was only a small effect of social norms information on binge drinking, drinking quantity, and peak BAC. For these outcomes, effects were not any different across the different delivery modes.Only small effects were found for web feedback and individual face-to-face feedback on frequency of alcohol consumed. Only a small effect of individual face-to-face feedback on alcohol related problems, but no effects were found for mailed or web feedback. Similarly, no effects were found for group face-to-face feedback or for marketing campaigns on frequency of alcohol consumed and typical BAC.

Due to the quality of evidence being very low, we are uncertain if perceived satisfaction in the rate of recovery differed in people who were not prescribed postoperative equipment and restrictions (135/151 satisfied) compared to those prescribed equipment and restrictions (113/152) (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 0.93; 265 participants, one trial; number needed to treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 7).

Two of these studies investigated providing people with equipment, such as raised toilet seats and rails, and restricting their body movements (one of these studies also provided people with physiotherapy). One study investigated teaching participants about doing certain activities of daily living in a safe way to promote self-care without the risk of dislocating the new hip. The interventions were different and thus we did not combine the results. One study compared outcomes for participants randomised to the provision of hip precautions, equipment and functional restrictions versus no provision of hip precautions or equipment or functional restrictions. This is the main comparator in the review. Health-related quality of life (lower scores mean better quality of life) We cannot tell from our results whether the intervention has an important effect on health-related quality of life (no numerical results provided) because the sample size was small and the study design flawed. Function We cannot tell from our results whether the intervention has an important effect on functional outcomes (no numerical results provided) because the sample size was small and the study design flawed. Complications and adverse events There were no dislocations or adverse events. Outcomes of interest not measured Pain, treatment success and re-operation rate were not measured. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the quality of the evidence. Due to issues relating to the small number of participants, size of studies and study conduct, including poorly blinding assessors to group allocation, we rated the quality of the evidence as 'very low'. Further research is highly likely to change the conclusions drawn from these results. We are uncertain whether the interventions improved outcomes."

The majority were conducted in laboratory settings (14/24), with adult participants (17/24), and used between-participants designs (19/24). All studies were conducted in high-income countries, predominantly in the USA (14/24). Six studies investigated availability interventions, of which two changed the absolute number of different options available, and four altered the relative proportion of less-healthy (to healthier) options. Most studies (4/6) manipulated (Move, treat, or operate with the hands or by mechanical means, especially in a skillful manner.) snack foods or drink (A dosing measurement based on the drink unit.)s. For selection outcomes, meta-analysis of three comparisons from three studies (n = 154) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a large reduction in selection of the targeted food(s): SMD \u22121.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) \u22121.90 to \u22120.37) (low certainty evidence). For consumption outcomes, meta-analysis of three comparisons from two studies (n = 150) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a moderate reduction in consumption of those foods, but with considerable uncertainty: SMD \u22120.55 (95% CI \u22121.27 to 0.18) (low certainty evidence). Eighteen studies investigated proximity interventions. Most (14/18) changed the distance at which a snack food or drink (A dosing measurement based on the drink unit.) was placed from the participants, whilst four studies changed the order of meal components encountered along a line.

For consumption outcomes, meta-analysis of 15 comparisons from 12 studies (n = 1098) found that exposure to food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its consumption: SMD \u22120.60 (95% CI \u22120.84 to \u22120.36) (low certainty evidence). Meta-regression analyses indicated that this effect was greater: the farther away the product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.) was placed; when only the targeted product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)(s) was available; when participants were of low deprivation status; and when the study was at high risk of bias. The current evidence suggests that changing the number of available food options or altering the positioning (Alignment of the body to promote comfort and function.) of foods could contribute to meaningful changes in behaviour, justifying policy actions to promote such changes within food environments. However, the certainty of this evidence as assessed by GRADE is low or very low.

However, discontinuation rates were not significantly different. The use of occupational PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) is based on limited direct evidence of effect.

There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral regimen (A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.)s following occupational exposure to HIV. However, due to the success of combination therapies (The treatment of a disease or condition by several different means simultaneously or sequentially.) in treating HIV-infected individuals, a combination of antiretroviral drugs (Agents used to treat RETROVIRIDAE INFECTIONS.) should be used for PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.).

The remaining initiatives did not show a statistically significant mean change. Seven of the 10 initiatives were multi-component and incorporated intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) activities of a structural nature (e.g. food product reformulation, food procurement policy in specific settings).

Initiatives ranged from one activity (e.g. in Japan, which at the time of writing had a public information campaign) to many activities (e.g. in the United Kingdom, which provided five activities including on-package nutrition information, restrictions on marketing to children and food product reformulation). Of the 15 countries that met inclusion criteria, seven provided information about funding source, of which six reported non-industry funding. The other eight countries did not report a funding source for one or more data point(s). Five of the 10 countries included in the quantitative analysis (China, Finland, France, Ireland and England) showed a decrease in salt intake after the intervention. Two of the 10 countries (Canada, Switzerland) showed an increase in salt intake after the intervention, however, in both countries the only data available were from several years prior to the intervention starting. Because the initiatives were very different, we cannot present an overall finding of whether these types of initiatives work. When we focused on the subset of seven countries whose salt reduction initiatives included multiple components and were not focused solely on educating the public, we found that more than half (four of seven) showed a decrease in salt intake from pre-intervention to post-intervention. When we examined the nine initiatives that analysed men and women separately, we found that amongst men, more than half (five of nine) showed a decrease in salt intake after the intervention. Amongst women, the pattern of findings was less clear, with three of nine interventions showing a decrease, two showing an increase and four showing no change in salt intake. Low-bias study designs, such as randomised controlled trials, typically are not suitable for evaluating complex initiatives such as these; therefore, we rated all of the studies included in this review as having low methodological quality. Large nationally representative samples of the population and careful measurement of dietary sodium intake were strengths of several studies. However, because of study design limitations, the trustworthiness of study results is not clear. Overall, our results show that national government initiatives have the potential to achieve population-wide reductions in salt intake, especially amongst men, and particularly if they employ more than one strategy and include structural activities such as food product reformulation (i.e. food companies putting less salt in food products). The wide variation of results across the studies we found presents a challenge in interpreting the current evidence and this warrants more research to help us understand this."

One study reported that clonidine (An imidazoline sympatholytic agent that stimulates ALPHA-2 ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS and central IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS.) reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage and increased the second stage of sleep. However, results for other sleep-related (A parasomnia characterized by paroxysmal episodes of choreoathetotic, ballistic, dystonic movements, and semipurposeful activity.) outcomes with clonidine (An imidazoline sympatholytic agent that stimulates ALPHA-2 ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS and central IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS.) were uncertain.

It is unclear whether use of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants as part of nutritional intake in patients with ARDS improves long-term survival. It is uncertain whether omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants reduce length of ICU stay and the number of days spent on a ventilator, or if they improve oxygenation.

Despite different designs, populations and details of questioning methods, the narrative review showed that more specific questioning of participants led to more AEs detected compared to a more general enquiry. A subset of six studies suggested that more severe, bothersome, or otherwise clinically relevant AEs were reported when an initial open enquiry was used, while some less severe, bothersome, or clinically relevant AEs were only reported with a subsequent specific enquiry. However, two studies showed that quite severe or debilitating (The property of lacking physical strength.) AEs were only detected by an interview, while other studies did not find a difference in the nature of AEs between elicitation methods. No conclusions could be made regarding the impact of question method on the ability to detect a statistically significant difference between study groups. There was no common statistical rubric, but we were able to represent some effect measures as a risk ratio of the proportion of participants with at least one AE. This showed a lower level of reporting for open questions (O) compared to checklists (CL), with a range for the risk ratios of 0.12 to 0.64. This review supports concerns that methods to elicit participant-reported AEs influence the detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) of these data. There was a risk for under-detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) of AEs in studies using a more general elicitation method compared to those using a comprehensive method. These AEs may be important from a clinical perspective or for patients. This under-detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) could compromise ability to pool AE data. However, the impact on the nature of the AE detected by different methods is unclear. The wide variety and low quality of methods to compare elicitation strategies limited this review. Future studies would be improved by using and reporting clear definitions and terminology for AEs (and other important variables), frequency and time period over which they were ascertained, how they were graded, assessed for a relationship to the study drug, coded, and tabulated/reported. While the many potential AE endpoints in a trial may preclude the development of general AE patient-reported outcome measurement instruments, much could also be learnt from how these employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand data elicited.

                "Clinical drug trials or studies are usually conducted to assess how well the drug works but also whether it causes any harm (side effects or adverse effects). Adverse effects can be detected by the trial doctor examining participants or taking some blood samples or doing other kinds of tests. The trial staff can also ask participants about how they are feeling after taking the trial drug. However, the way participants are asked about their health can vary from trial to trial, or even within a trial. In some trials, participants may be asked a simple open question such as 'how have you been feeling?', while in other trials, participants may be asked about whether they have had any of a long list of possible symptoms (such as 'have you had a headache, stomach ache, or sore muscles?'). There has been concern that these different kinds of questions and how they are phrased will impact on what participants report about their health during a trial. This might then affect the trial's results and what we know about the side effects of drugs. We did this review to look at studies that compared different types of participant questioning methods in order to investigate these issues. We found 33 studies comparing mainly open questions with checklist-type questions, but also some ratings scales and participant interviews. While the studies were all very different in terms of the types of disease, drugs, and patients studied, we found in general that, as would be expected, when a more specific type of question was asked (like a checklist), participants reported more symptoms. What is interesting is that, in those studies that looked more closely at the types of symptoms reported, it seems that an open question picks up the more severe or bothersome symptoms compared to a checklist-type question. However, some studies found that even quite severe or bothersome symptoms were not reported when a participant is asked an open question and these severe symptoms will only be reported with the more specific question. This makes it difficult to say whether one method is better than any other and the different questioning methods may, in fact, be complementary and therefore should be used together. It is also difficult to say what a specific question should include, as it might take too long for a participant to have to answer a very long list. While more research is needed to resolve the remaining uncertainties, it is very important for trials to be clear about which kind of questioning was used when they publish their results. This will help readers understand the trial's findings about the side effects and make it easier to make accurate comparisons between trials."

One study was of parallel design with the remaining six being cross-over in design; participant numbers ranged from 17 to 75. The total study duration varied between four days and two years. The age of participants ranged between seven and 63 years with a wide range of disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) severity reported. Six studies enrolled participants who were clinically stable, whilst participants in one study had been hospitalised with an infective exacerbation. All studies compared autogenic drainage to one (or more) other recognised airway clearance technique. Exercise is commonly used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis (An autosomal recessive genetic disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) of the EXOCRINE GLANDS.); however, there were no studies identified comparing exercise with autogenic drainage. The quality of the evidence was generally low or very low. The main reasons for downgrading the level of evidence were the frequent use of a cross-over design, outcome reporting bias and the inability to blind participants. The review's primary outcome, forced expiratory volume in one second, was the most common outcome measured and was reported by all seven studies; only three studies reported on quality of life (also a primary outcome of the review). One study reported on adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) and described a decrease in oxygen saturation levels (The determination of oxygen-hemoglobin saturation of blood either by withdrawing a sample and passing it through a classical photoelectric oximeter or by electrodes attached to some translucent part of the body like finger, earlobe, or skin fold.) whilst performing active cycle of breathing techniques, but not with autogenic drainage. Six of the seven included studies measured forced vital capacity and three of the studies used mid peak expiratory flow (The maximum rate of gas flow, beginning at the point of peak inspiratory capacity, that can be sustained during forced exhalation for a defined period of time.) (per cent predicted) as an outcome. Six studies reported sputum weight. Less commonly used outcomes included oxygen saturation levels (The determination of oxygen-hemoglobin saturation of blood either by withdrawing a sample and passing it through a classical photoelectric oximeter or by electrodes attached to some translucent part of the body like finger, earlobe, or skin fold.), personal preference, hospital admissions or intravenous antibiotics. There were no statistically significant differences found between any of the techniques used with respect to the outcomes measured except when autogenic drainage was described as being the preferred technique of the participants in one study over postural drainage (A rehabilitation therapy for removal of copious mucus secretion from the lung of patients with disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.)s such as CHRONIC BRONCHITIS; BRONCHIECTASIS; PULMONARY ABSCESS; or CYSTIC FIBROSIS.) and percussion (Act of striking a part with short, sharp blows as an aid in diagnosing the condition beneath the sound obtained.). Autogenic drainage is a challenging technique that requires commitment from the individual. As such, this intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) merits systematic review to ensure its effectiveness for people with cystic fibrosis (An autosomal recessive genetic disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) of the EXOCRINE GLANDS.). From the studies assessed, autogenic drainage was not found to be superior to any other form of airway clearance technique. Larger studies are required to better evaluate autogenic drainage in comparison to other airway clearance techniques in view of the relatively small number of participants in this review and the complex study designs. The studies recruited a range of participants and were not powered to assess non-inferiority. The varied length and design of the studies made the analysis of pooled data challenging.",

                "We searched the literature for studies comparing at least two sessions of autogenic drainage with other breathing techniques and devices which help to clear the lungs of mucus. We included seven studies in the review involving 208 people with cystic fibrosis, aged between seven and 63 years of age. People were selected for one physiotherapy treatment or the other randomly. The number of people in the studies ranged from 17 to 75, and had a wide range of disease severity. The studies lasted from four days to two years in total. We did not find any clear evidence that autogenic drainage was better than the other techniques for lung function or quality of life in either the short-term or long-term studies. This was also true for our other outcome measures such as hospital admissions, additional antibiotic treatment, exercise tolerance and oxygen saturation, but in one study autogenic drainage was the preferred technique compared to postural drainage and percussion. Exercise was identified as a comparator for airway clearance by the authors of this review but no included studies used it in this way, even though it is often used as an alternative therapy by people with cystic fibrosis. Overall, the quality of the evidence from the studies was judged to be mainly low or very low. The main problems for this being the small numbers of participants in each study, the unclear reporting of results in the studies and the study design used. In one study, which was classed as having a high risk of bias due to incomplete results, those taking part had to change physiotherapy technique halfway through the study and there were many who dropped out and did not comply with the postural drainage and percussion treatment arm. Five of the seven studies used research staff to assess results who did not know which technique each person was using and this improved the quality of the evidence and reduced any bias."

Further studies examining non-CBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.) models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD (A condition marked by excessive worry and feelings of fear, dread, and uneasiness that last six months or longer.).",

                "This review aimed to find out whether psychological therapies are effective for GAD, and whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is more effective than other psychological therapy approaches, including psychodynamic and supportive therapies. The review included 25 studies, with a total of 1305 participants. All the studies used a CBT approach, and compared CBT against treatment as usual or waiting list (13 studies), or against another psychological therapy (12 studies). The review showed that people attending for psychological therapy based on a CBT approach were more likely to have reduced anxiety at the end of treatment than people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for therapy. CBT was also very effective in reducing secondary symptoms of worry and depression. People who attended for group CBT and older people were more likely to drop out of therapy. None of the studies comparing CBT with treatment as usual or waiting list looked at the long-term effectiveness of CBT. It is not clear whether people attending for CBT sessions were more likely to have reduced anxiety than people attending for psychodynamic therapy or supportive therapy, because only one study compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, and the six studies that compared CBT with supportive therapy showed differing results. None of the studies included in the review reported on the possible side effects or acceptability of psychological therapies. More studies should be carried out to establish whether psychodynamic and supportive therapies are effective for GAD, and whether CBT is more helpful than other psychological therapy approaches in treating GAD."

These trials found that giving progestogen medication to women with recurrent miscarriages early in their pregnancy may help lower the rates of miscarriage in that pregnancy from 27.5% to 20.1%. We believe that these findings are based on evidence of only moderate quality, so we cannot be certain about the results. We did not find that giving the progestogen medication by mouth, as a shot (injection), or in the vagina, was any better than any of the other ways. We also found that the trials showed that giving progestogen to women with prior recurrent miscarriages made the chances of having a live baby in the current pregnancy slightly higher. We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth because the evidence is very low-quality. We did not find evidence of improvement in other outcomes such as newborn death, stillbirth, low birthweight, or newborn birth defects for women given progestogens. We found evidence from randomized controlled trials that giving progestogen medication may prevent miscarriage for women with recurrent previous miscarriages."

For the most part, it was unclear if included studies adequately controlled for biases within their studies as such information was not often reported. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies relating to participant selection, allocation concealment, personnel and outcome assessor blinding, and attrition. The included trials rarely captured maternal and neonatal outcomes. For studies that did measure such outcomes, no difference was observed in pre-term (less than 37 weeks and 0 days gestational age.) birth rates (RR 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.51; three trials, 264 participants, moderate quality evidence), maternal toxicity at delivery (Delivery of the FETUS and PLACENTA under the care of an obstetrician or a health worker.)

These results held for both CM and MIB (involved in both ubiquitination and cell signaling.) combined. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low to moderate. The present evidence suggests that there is no difference in treatment outcomes to address drug use (Indication of drug use.) in pregnant women with use of psychosocial interventions, when taken in the presence of other comprehensive care options. However, few studies evaluated obstetrical or neonatal outcomes and rarely did so in a systematic way, making it difficult to assess the effect of psychosocial interventions on these clinically important outcomes.

The 1298 pregnant women received either CM or MIB techniques in adjunct to other comprehensive care options; women in the control group received usual care that included pharmacological treatment such as methadone maintenance, counselling, prenatal care, STD counselling and testing, transportation, and/or childcare. Nine studies used CM techniques vs. usual care, while five studies involved MIB techniques vs. usual care. All of the studies were completed in the United States of America and most participants were African American. Most studies used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-R) criteria to determine drug dependence. There were no differences in retention or abstinence between CM or MIB techniques and usual care. There were also no differences in birth outcomes between the groups. Overall, there is low to moderate quality of evidence from the included studies. Allocation methods were often described in very limited manner. Furthermore, many studies lacked attrition information which could have impacted results. While further information related to these methods could be helpful, future randomized trials using psychosocial interventions are unlikely to show a benefit. In addition, there was significant heterogeneity in terms of methods for measuring outcomes."

The trials were carried out in many countries and regions, including Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and USA. We also identified two ongoing studies. The evidence was current to October 2017. Transradial access was associated with a reduction in the composite outcome (comprising two or more combined outcomes) of net adverse clinical events (NACE), including death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction (injury of the heart muscle), stroke (insult to the brain), need to reintervene on the same site of coronary artery stenosis (narrowing), and bleeding during the first 30 days following intervention. When assessing individual outcomes, the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke was similar between groups. Transradial access reduced death from cardiac causes, death from all causes during the first 30 days following intervention, bleeding, and local complications at the access site. The transradial approach shortened the length of stay in hospital, but was associated with a higher radiation exposure and more technical failures requiring an alternate vascular access route. We rated the quality of the evidence for short-term myocardial infarction and all-cause death as high. We rated short-term NACE, cardiac death, and success of the procedure as moderate quality evidence. Evidence for bleeding and access site complications was low quality."

We did not pool data due to the heterogeneity between the two trials in terms of the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s and the settings (A compulsion to set fires.). The two studies measured 31 different outcomes, yet they did not measure the same outcome. There are six ongoing studies that we expect to include in future versions of this review. Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible. This and small sample sizes meant that the overall certainty of all the evidence was very low. One individually randomised RCT (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a palliative care (Care alleviating symptoms without curing the underlying disease.) team for people with advanced dementia hospitalised for an acute illness (A state of ill health, bodily malfunction, or discomfort.). While this trial reported that a palliative care (Care alleviating symptoms without curing the underlying disease.) plan (A rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the PLA2G6 gene.) was more likely to be developed for participants in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group (risk ratio (RR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 25.02), the plan (A rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the PLA2G6 gene.) was only adopted for two participants, both in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group, while in hospital. The palliative care (Care alleviating symptoms without curing the underlying disease.) plan (A rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the PLA2G6 gene.) was more likely to be available on discharge in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75). We found no evidence that the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) affected mortality in hospital (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13), decisions to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (The artificial substitution of heart and lung action as indicated for HEART ARREST resulting from electric shock, DROWNING, respiratory arrest, or other causes.) in hospital or the clinical care provided during hospital admission, but for the latter, event rates were low and the results were associated with a lot of uncertainty. One cluster RCT (256 participants, each enrolled with a family carer) evaluated the effect of a decision aid on end-of-life feeding options on surrogate decision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Data for 90 participants (35% of the original study) met the definition of advanced dementia for this review and were re-analysed for the purposes of the review. In this subset, intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) surrogates had lower scores for decisional conflict measured on the Decisional Conflict Scale (mean difference -0.30, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.01, reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units considered meaningful) and were more likely than participants in the control group to discuss feeding options with a clinician (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64), but imprecision meant that there was significant uncertainty about both results. Very little high quality work has been completed exploring palliative care (Care alleviating symptoms without curing the underlying disease.) intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s in advanced dementia. There were only two included studies in this review, with variation in the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s and in the settings (A compulsion to set fires.) that made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis of data for any outcome. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care (Care alleviating symptoms without curing the underlying disease.) intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s in advanced dementia.

We also found six studies that were underway but the results were not yet published. One study found that having a small team of doctors and nurses trained in palliative care made little difference to how people with advanced dementia were treated while in hospital. But, having this special team meant that more people had a palliative care plan when they were discharged from hospital. The other study measured if giving written information to relatives explaining the different methods that can be used to feed people with advanced dementia helped either the relatives or the person. This study found that giving relatives this information made it a little easier for relatives to make decisions about what methods would be used to feed the person with dementia. We only found two studies and the two palliative care methods in these studies were very different. We cannot be very certain about how accurate either of these results reported here are, partly because only a small number of people took part in the studies. So from these studies, it is hard to be sure whether palliative care makes a difference to people with advanced dementia. Little research has been done about people with advanced dementia, often because of ethical concerns. However, although it is hard to do research with people with dementia, more well-designed studies are required to work out how palliative care can be used best in this special population."

The third trial randomised 244 women to radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy versus chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The evidence produced by these three well-conducted trials suggests that recurrence of a woman's cancer and her chances of dying from breast cancer are similar regardless of the order of the treatments, provided that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are commenced within seven months of the surgery. The trials provided limited information regarding adverse events, side effects or quality of life associated with the different sequences of treatment. The limited evidence available does suggest that the frequency and severity of side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are similar regardless of which sequence is used. However, it should be noted that the women in these trials were treated, on average, in the early 2000s.

A total of 622 participants took part in the studies, 346 participants received chromium picolinate and 276 received placebo. The evidence is current to December 2012. When the results obtained from the doses of chromium picolinate investigated (200 \u00b5g, 400 \u00b5g, 500 \u00b5g, 1000 \u00b5g) were pooled, study participants lost around 1 kg of body weight more than participants receiving placebo. We were unable to find good evidence that this potential weight loss effect increased with increasing dose of chromium picolinate. Only three of nine studies provided information on adverse events, so we were unable to determine whether chromium picolinate supplements are safe and whether any potential harms may increase with dose. In addition, the length of studies included was rather short (maximum of 24 weeks), so we were unable to determine any long-term effects of supplementation. No study reported whether supplementation was associated with increases in deaths from any cause or illnesses (such as myocardial infarction or stroke), or the health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects of supplementation. The overall quality of evidence was considered low and we have inadequate information from which to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of chromium picolinate supplementation in overweight or obese adults."

In general studies were small and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors (Plasmids encoding COLICINS.) reduced the quality of the evidence. Two comparisons compared different iodine (represented by the atomic symbol I, atomic number 53, and atomic weight of 126.90.) preparations with no antiseptic treatment and found no clear evidence of effects for these treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.). The outcome data available were limited and what evidence there was low quality. One study compared a zinc oxide (A mild astringent and topical protectant with some antiseptic action.) mesh dressing with a plain mesh dressing. There was no clear evidence of a difference in time to wound healing between groups. There was some evidence of a difference in measures used to assess wound infection (Invasion of a wound by pathogenic microorganisms.) (wound with foul smell and number of participants prescribed antibiotics (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.)) which favoured the zinc oxide (A mild astringent and topical protectant with some antiseptic action.) group. This was low quality evidence. One study reported that sucralfate cream (A basic aluminum complex of sulfated sucrose.) increased the likelihood of healing open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy (The surgical removal of HEMORRHOIDS.) compared to a petrolatum cream (A colloidal system of semisolid hydrocarbons obtained from PETROLEUM.) (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.99) over a three week period. This evidence was graded as being of moderate quality. The study also reported lower wound pain scores in the sucralfate group (A basic aluminum complex of sulfated sucrose.). There was a reduction in time to healing of open wounds following haemorrhoidectomy (The surgical removal of HEMORRHOIDS.) when treated with Triclosan (A diphenyl ether derivative used in cosmetics and toilet soaps as an antiseptic.) post-operatively compared with a standard sodium hypochlorite solution (used as an oxidizing and bleaching agent and as a disinfectant.) (mean difference -1.70 days, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.01). This was classed as low quality evidence. There was moderate quality evidence that more open wounds resulting from excision (removed.) of pyomyositis (A suppurative infection of muscle.) abscesses (Accumulation of purulent material in tissues, organs, or circumscribed spaces, usually associated with signs of infection.) healed when treated with a honey-soaked gauze compared with a EUSOL-soaked gauze over three weeks' follow-up (RR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.42). There was also some evidence of a reduction in the mean length of hospital stay in the honey group. Evidence was taken from one small study that only had 43 participants.

There is no robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of any antiseptic/antibiotic/anti-bacterial preparation evaluated to date for use on SWHSI. Where some evidence for possible treatment effects was reported, it stemmed from single studies with small participant numbers and was classed as moderate or low quality evidence.

We found 11 studies which included a total of 886 participants.These all looked at different comparisons. Several different types of wounds were included. Studies looked at wounds after diabetic foot amputation, pilonidal sinus surgery, treatment of various types of abscess, surgery for haemorrhoids, complications after caesarean section and healing of openings created by operations such as colostomy. Most studies compared a range of different types of antibacterial treatments to treatments without antibacterial activity, but four compared different antibacterial treatments. Although some of the trials suggested that one treatment may be better than another, this evidence was limited by the size of the studies and the ways they were carried out and reported. All of the studies had low numbers of participants and in some cases these numbers were very small. Many of the studies did not report important information about how they were carried out, so it was difficult to tell whether the results presented were likely to be true. More, better quality, research is needed to find out the effects of antimicrobial treatments on surgical wounds which are healing by secondary intention. Assessed as up to date November 2015."

Two trials of computer-assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) (A primary or metastatic malignant neoplasm involving the breast.) survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed (A powerful central nervous system stimulant and sympathomimetic.), executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed- and immediate- memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well-being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed-, immediate- and verbal-memory, self-reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL (The overall enjoyment of life.)). The meta-analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well-being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to 0.83; I2= 67%) or two months post-intervention (SMD - 0.21, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.47; I2 = 63%) or on mental well-being two months post-intervention (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.34; I2 = 67%). Lower mental well-being immediately post-intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait-list controls (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.16; I2 = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be low quality and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear. Overall, the, albeit low-quality evidence may be interpreted to suggest that non-pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment (Interference or disruption of cognitive processes.) following systemic cancer (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) treatment. Larger, multi-site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach. There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment (Interference or disruption of cognitive processes.) among cancer (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.) patient groups other than women with breast cancer (A term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.)

These included two studies of computerised cognitive skills practice, two cognitive coping skills training programmes, one meditation intervention and one exercise intervention. All five studies included a total of 235 women who had been treated for breast cancer. The findings suggest that cognitive skills practice and cognitive coping skills training may be useful in improving patient reports and formal assessments of cognition, as well as quality of life. There was insufficient evidence to know if meditation and exercise interventions had any effect on cognition. The quality of the evidence was low. There were problems with study designs and, so, we need to be cautious about our conclusions. There is not enough good quality evidence to know if any interventions improve cognitive impairment or maintain cognitive functioning among people who have received systemic treatment for cancer. There are several ongoing trials in the field, which may provide the necessary evidence in the future."

However, we did not find any data concerning service use, functioning of participants or economic costs of these treatments. The overall results showed chlorpromazine and piperacetazine may have similar clinical efficacy and side effect profiles. However, these results are based on very low-quality data. The number of included studies and the sample size of participants included in this review is small, and the quality of data very low, so the results of this review are not conclusive and must be used with caution.

Antimicrobial lock solutions (a device that consists of an antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) drug powder packaged in vials in specified amounts and intended for use in clinical laboratories for determining in vitro susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to these therapeutic agents.) probably reduces CRI per 1000 catheter-days (27 studies: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.53; I2 = 54%; low certainty evidence), however antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) lock solutions (a device that consists of an antimicrobial (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) drug powder packaged in vials in specified amounts and intended for use in clinical laboratories for determining in vitro susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to these therapeutic agents.) probably makes little or no difference to the risk of thrombosis (Formation and development of a thrombus or blood clot in the blood vessel.) per 1000 catheter days (14 studies: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22; I2 = 83%; very low certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis of antibiotic (Substances naturally produced by microorganisms or their derivatives that selectively target microorganisms not humans.) and the combination of both lock solutions showed that both probably reduced CRI per 1000 catheter-days (13 studies: RR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.42; I2 = 47%) and risk of thrombosis (Formation and development of a thrombus or blood clot in the blood vessel.) per 1000 catheter-days (4 studies: RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.49; I2 = 0%), respectively.

Fifteen studies used only antibiotic lock solutions, 21 used non-antibiotic lock solutions, and 4 used both (antibiotic and non-antibiotic) lock solutions. Studies measured the incidence of CRIs and catheter thrombosis, or both. Overall quality of the studies was low for CRIs and very low for thrombosis. There was no information on funding sources for most of the studies. In general antimicrobial lock solutions are likely superior to standard solutions in preventing CRIs among patients undergoing HD through a CVC, but non-antibiotic solutions did not prove to reduce CRI. They are no worse than heparin at preventing thrombosis. Other adverse effects were not reported in most studies. Our confidence in these results is low due to the quality of the studies. Some antimicrobial (antibiotic and the combination of antibiotic-non antibiotic) lock solutions decrease the incidence of CRIs compared to heparin. Their effect on CVC permeability remains unclear. The quality of the studies is low and very low, respectively; therefore, more studies are needed to confirm the benefits and harms of antimicrobial lock solutions."

The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 22.33 years). In 13 studies, follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long-term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding.

However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intention-to-treat analysis. Included studies compared the active cycle of breathing technique with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high frequency chest compression (A respiratory support system that applies high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) for airway clearance by removing mucus to enhance pulmonary function.) devices, conventional chest physiotherapy (Exercises to provide postural drainage of lungs), and positive expiratory pressure (The maximum amount of pressure applied to the lungs during expiration.). Preference of technique varied: more participants preferred autogenic drainage over the active cycle of breathing technique; more preferred the active cycle of breathing technique over airway oscillating devices; and more were comfortable with the active cycle of breathing technique versus high frequency chest compression (A respiratory support system that applies high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) for airway clearance by removing mucus to enhance pulmonary function.). No significant difference was seen in quality of life, sputum weight, exercise tolerance, lung function, or oxygen saturation between the active cycle of breathing technique and autogenic drainage or between the active cycle of breathing technique and airway oscillating devices. There was no significant difference in lung function and the number of pulmonary exacerbations (An acute episode of worsening pulmonary symptoms related to cystic fibrosis.) between the active cycle of breathing technique alone or in conjunction with conventional chest physiotherapy (Exercises to provide postural drainage of lungs).

Each of the five studies compared different techniques: the active cycle of breathing technique was compared with autogenic drainage, airway oscillating devices, high-frequency chest compression devices, positive expiratory pressure, and conventional chest physiotherapy. Most studies lasted a single day, but there were two studies that lasted between one and three years. Participants ranged in age from six to 63 years and most (63%) were male. We found that the active cycle of breathing technique was comparable with other treatments in outcomes such as quality of life, personal preference, exercise tolerance, lung function, sputum weight, oxygen saturation, and the number of pulmonary exacerbations. We were not able to show that any single technique was better than another. Longer studies are needed to better assess the effects of the active cycle of breathing technique on outcomes important for people with cystic fibrosis such as quality of life and personal preference. Many of the studies did not provide enough details of their methods to determine if there were any biases that might have affected the results. Many studies did not report how they decided who would get which treatment and how they made sure that the people who were putting people into the different treatment groups and those who were assessing the results did not know which group each individual was in. Most of the included studies had a cross-over design (where people have one treatment and then switch to the second), and many of these did not report the length of time in between different treatments. As it is possible that the first treatment might affect the results of the next treatment, we only included results from the first treatment period. Many of the studies did not report separate results for just the first treatment period, so we did not include their results in our review. All participants knew which treatment group they were in (it is not possible to disguise different physiotherapy techniques). This could have affected the results for some of the self-reported outcomes, such as quality of life, personal preference, or exercise tolerance, but is unlikely to have affected the more objective outcomes, such as lung function. Most of the studies followed those taking part for less than one month and did this for most of the participants for the entire study period. In two out of the three longer studies more than 10% of the people taking part dropped out. The study results could be affected if the people who dropped out of the studies were not evenly spread across the different treatment groups. Over half of the studies checked that participants were using the airway clearance therapy they were supposed to. Most of the studies reported on all their planned outcomes.

                "This review identified methods that encouraged people to stay in trials. We searched scientific databases for randomised studies (where people are allocated to one of two or more possible treatments in a random manner) or quasi-randomised studies (where allocation is not really random, e.g. based on date of birth, order in which they attended clinic) that compared methods of increasing retention in trials. We included trials of participants from any age, gender, ethnic, cultural, language and geographic groups. The methods that appeared to work were offering or giving a small amount of money for return of a completed questionnaire and enclosing a small amount of money with a questionnaire with the promise of a further small amount of money for return of a filled in questionnaire. The effect of other ways to keep people in trials is still not clear and more research is needed to see if these really do work. Such methods are shorter questionnaires, sending questionnaires by recorded delivery, using a trial design where people know which treatment they will receive, sending specially designed letters with a reply self addressed stamped envelope followed by a number of reminders, offering a donation to charity or entry into a prize draw, sending a reminder to the study site about participants to follow-up, sending questionnaires close to the time the patient was last followed-up, managing peoples' follow-up, conducting follow-up by telephone and changing the order of questionnaire questions. The methods that we identified were tested in trials run in many different disease areas and settings and, in some cases, were tested in only one trial. Therefore, more studies are needed to help decide whether our findings could be used in other research fields."

We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and data related to the first treatment period for the other five studies were not yet available. Seven included studies provided data related to the primary outcome, and eight studies provided data related to more than one secondary outcome. Our analysis was hampered by the fact that a large proportion of the included studies reported no events in either study arm. No studies reported significant differences between device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.)s in relation to the primary review outcome: failure to adequately mechanically ventilate (A method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients by use of a powered device that forces oxygenated air into the lungs.). We evaluated this outcome by assessing two variables: inadequate oxygenation (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 3.31; four studies, N = 617) and inadequate ventilation (not estimable; one study, N = 80). More time was required to establish an effective airway using pLMA (mean difference (MD) 10.12 seconds, 95% CI 5.04 to 15.21; P < 0.0001; I\u00b2 = 73%; two studies, N = 434). Peak airway pressure during positive pressure ventilation (connected to a ventilator.) was lower in cLMA participants (MD 0.84, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.67; P = 0.04; I\u00b2 = 0%; four studies, N = 259). Mean oropharyngeal leak (OPL) pressure was higher in pLMA participants (MD 6.93, 95% CI 4.23 to 9.62; P < 0.00001; I\u00b2 = 87%; six studies, N = 709). The quality of evidence for all outcomes, as assessed by GRADE score, is low mainly owing to issues related to blinding and imprecision. Data show no important differences between device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.)s with regard to failure to insert the device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.), use of an alternate device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.), mucosal injury, sore throat (Inflammation of the throat (PHARYNX).), bronchospasm (Spasmodic contraction of the smooth muscle of the bronchi.), gastric insufflation, regurgitation, coughing (A sudden, audible expulsion of air from the lungs through a partially closed glottis, preceded by inhalation.), and excessive leak. Data were insufficient to allow estimation of differences for obstruction (Blockage of a passageway.) related to the device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.). None of the studies reported postoperative nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) and vomiting (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) as an outcome. We are uncertain about the effects of either of the airway device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.)s in terms of failure of oxygenation or ventilation because there were very few events. Results were uncertain in terms of differences for several complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.). Low-quality evidence suggests that the ProSeal laryngeal (A tubular organ of VOICE production.) mask airway makes a better seal and therefore may be more suitable than the Classic laryngeal (A tubular organ of VOICE production.) mask airway for positive pressure ventilation (connected to a ventilator.). The Classic laryngeal (A tubular organ of VOICE production.) mask airway may be quicker to insert, but this is unlikely to be clinically meaningful.",

Researchers directly compared cLMA against pLMA for providing artificial breathing during surgery. We identified six cross-over studies that are awaiting classification; one is completed but has not been published, and five other studies are gathering data related to the first treatment period that are not yet available. Five studies did not report any funding sources. Of the remaining three studies, one reported that the Laryngeal Mask Company sponsored some data but was not involved in study design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. The Joseph Drown Foundation, in Los Angeles, Califiornia, in the USA, partially supported another study. One of the authors of the final study had received research funds from Intavent Ltd, manufacturer of both types of laryngeal mask airway, but Intavent Ltd did not sponsor this study. We are unsure whether these devices exhibit important differences in providing adequate oxygenation and ventilation because there was not enough data to enable us to draw any firm conclusions. ProSeal laryngeal mask airway may provides a better seal because it leaks at higher pressure, but Classic laryngeal mask airway may be quicker to insert. However, these findings are not important clinically. We assessed all of the included studies as providing low-quality evidence because anaesthetists knew which device was being used on which participants (although this was probably unavoidable), and because it was unclear whether the investigator who collected the data was unaware of the intervention. This fact created the potential for bias."

            "input": "We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders (Chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal disorders without an identifiable structural or biochemical explanation by the routine diagnostic tests.); five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome (A disorder of the intestines commonly marked by abdominal pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), bloating, and changes in a person's bowel habits.). The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides (Carbohydrates consisting of between two (DISACCHARIDES) and ten MONOSACCHARIDES connected by either an alpha- or beta-glycosidic link.), disaccharides (Oligosaccharides containing two monosaccharide units linked by a glycosidic bond.), monosaccharides (Single chain carbohydrates that are the most basic units of CARBOHYDRATES.) and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study). We found that children treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ed with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) frequency at zero to three months postintervention (In medicine, a treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment or action taken to prevent or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) disease, or improve health in other ways.) than those given placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. We found that children treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ed with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at zero to three months postintervention (In medicine, a treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment or action taken to prevent or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) disease, or improve health in other ways.) than those given placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome (A disorder of the intestines commonly marked by abdominal pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), bloating, and changes in a person's bowel habits.) treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ed with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at zero to three months postintervention (In medicine, a treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment or action taken to prevent or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) disease, or improve health in other ways.) than those given placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ed with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at three to six months postintervention (In medicine, a treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment or action taken to prevent or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) disease, or improve health in other ways.) compared to those receiving placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies. We found that children treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ed with fibre-based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) at zero to three months postintervention (In medicine, a treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment or action taken to prevent or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) disease, or improve health in other ways.) than children given placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) intensity compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment.) at the same time point (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible. We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.); no major adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment with a drug or other therapy.) were reported. Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome (A disorder of the intestines commonly marked by abdominal pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), bloating, and changes in a person's bowel habits.). We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) in children with RAP. Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions (Any alteration or treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment in an individual's diet with a planned goal, usually designed to improve the individual's overall health.) are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations.",

                "This evidence is current to June 2016. Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria, including 13 studies of probiotics and four studies of fibre interventions. We also found one study of a diet low in substances known as FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) and one study of a fructose-restricted diet. All of the studies compared dietary interventions to a placebo or control. The trials were carried out in eight countries and included a total of 1453 participants, aged between five and 18 years. Most children were recruited from outpatient clinics. Most interventions lasted four to six weeks. Probiotics We found evidence from 13 studies suggesting that probiotics might be effective in improving pain in the shorter term. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported, other than dry mouth in one study. We judged this evidence to be of moderate or low quality because some studies were small, showed varying results, or were at risk of bias. Fibre supplements We found no clear evidence of improvement of pain from four studies of fibre supplements. Most studies did not report on other areas such as quality of daily life. No harmful effects were reported. There were few studies of fibre supplements, and some of these studies were at risk of bias. We judged this evidence to be of low quality. Low FODMAP diets We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of low FODMAP diets in children with RAP. Fructose-restricted diets We found only one study evaluating the effectiveness of fructose-restricted diets in children with RAP. We found some evidence suggesting that probiotics may be helpful in relieving pain in children with RAP in the short term. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of the management strategy for RAP. Further trials are needed to find out how effective probiotics are over longer periods of time and which probiotics might work best. We did not find convincing evidence that fibre supplements are effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Future larger, high-quality studies are needed to test the effectiveness of fibre and low FODMAP diet treatments."

Seventeen of the studies had student populations. Most of the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias for all forms of bias except detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) bias. Findings from the five trials with discrimination outcomes (n = 1196) were mixed, with effects showing a reduction, increase or consistent with no evidence of effect. The median standardised mean difference (SMD) for the three trials (n = 394) with continuous outcomes was -0.25, with SMDs ranging from -0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.39 to -0.31) to -0.17 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.20). Odds ratios (OR) for the two studies (n = 802) with dichotomous discrimination outcomes showed no evidence of effect: results were 1.30 (95% CI 0.53 to 3.19) and 1.19 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.65). The 19 trials (n = 3176) with prejudice outcomes had median SMDs favouring the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), at the three following time periods: -0.38 (immediate), -0.38 (1 week to 2 months) and -0.49 (6 to 9 months). SMDs for prejudice outcomes across all studies ranged from -2.94 (95% CI -3.52 to -2.37) to 2.40 (95% CI 0.62 to 4.18). The median SMDs indicate that mass media intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s may have a small to medium effect in decreasing prejudice, and are equivalent to reducing the level of prejudice from that associated with schizophrenia (A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.) to that associated with major depression (Depressive states usually of moderate intensity in contrast with major depression present in neurotic and psychotic disorders.). The studies were very heterogeneous, statistically, in their populations, intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s and outcomes, and only two meta-analyses within two subgroups were warranted. Data on secondary outcomes were sparse. Cost data were provided on request for three studies (n = 416), were highly variable, and did not address cost-effectiveness. Two studies (n = 455) contained statements about adverse effects and neither reported finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.) any. Mass media intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s may reduce prejudice, but there is insufficient evidence to determine their effects on discrimination. Very little is known about costs, adverse effects or other outcomes. Our review found few studies in middle- and low-income countries, or with employers or health professionals as the target group, and none targeted at children or adolescents. The finding (Clinical manifestations that can be either objective when observed by a physician, or subjective when perceived by the patient.)s are limited by the quality of the evidence, which was low for the primary outcomes for discrimination and prejudice, low for adverse effects and very low for costs. More research is required to establish the effects of mass media intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s on discrimination, to better understand which types of mass media intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) work best, to provide evidence about cost-effectiveness, and to fill evidence gaps (PROTEINS that specifically activate the GTP-phosphohydrolase activity of RAS PROTEINS.) about types of mass media not covered in this review.

Forty-six studies explored the views and experiences of healthy pregnant or postnatal women, 17 studies explored the views and experiences of healthcare providers and 22 studies incorporated the views of both women and healthcare providers. The studies took place in 41 countries, including eight high-income countries, 18 middle-income countries and 15 low-income countries, in rural, urban and semi-urban locations. We developed 52 findings in total and organised these into three thematic domains: socio-cultural context (11 findings, five moderate- or high-confidence); service design and provision (24 findings, 15 moderate- or high-confidence); and what matters to women and staff (17 findings, 11 moderate- or high-confidence) The third domain was sub-divided into two conceptual areas; personalised supportive care, and information and safety. We also developed two lines of argument, using high- or moderate-confidence findings: For women, initial or continued use of ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) depends on a perception that doing so will be a positive experience. This is a result of the provision of good-quality local services that are not dependent on the payment of informal fees and that include continuity of care that is authentically personalised, kind, caring, supportive, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful of women\u2019s need for privacy, and that allow staff to take the time needed to provide relevant support, information and clinical safety for the woman and the baby, as and when they need it. Women\u2019s perceptions of the value of ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) depend on their general beliefs about pregnancy as a healthy or a risky state, and on their reaction to being pregnant, as well as on local socio-cultural norms relating to the advantages or otherwise of antenatal care for healthy pregnancies, and for those with complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.). Whether they continue to use ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) or not depends on their experience of ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) design and provision when they access it for the first time. The capacity of healthcare providers to deliver the kind of high-quality, relationship-based, locally accessible ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) that is likely to facilitate access by women depends on the provision of sufficient resources and staffing as well as the time to provide flexible personalised, private appointments that are not overloaded (Too much fluid in the blood.) with organisational tasks. Such provision also depends on organisational norms and values that overtly value kind, caring staff who make effective, culturally-appropriate links with local communities, who respect women\u2019s belief that pregnancy is usually a normal life event, but who can recognise and respond to complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.) when they arise. Healthcare providers also require sufficient training and education to do their job well, as well as an adequate salary, so that they do not need to demand extra informal funds from women and families, to supplement their income, or to fund essential supplies. This review has identified key barriers (Something that blocks, prevents, separates, or limits.) and facilitators to the uptake (or not) of ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) services by pregnant women, and in the provision (or not) of good-quality ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) by healthcare providers. It complements existing effectiveness reviews of models of ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) provision and adds essential insights into why a particular type of ANC (The real number of white blood cells (WBC) that are neutrophils.) provided in specific local contexts may or may not be acceptable, accessible, or valued by some pregnant women and their families/communities. Those providing and funding services should consider the three thematic domains identified by the review as a basis for service development and improvement. Such developments should include pregnant and postnatal women, community members and other relevant stakeholders.",

Our findings suggest that women use antenatal care if they find it is a positive experience that fits with their beliefs and values, is easy for them to access, affordable, and treats them as an individual. They want care that helps them to feel that they and their baby are safe, and that is provided by kind, caring, culturally sensitive, flexible, and respectful staff that have time to give them support and reassurance about the health and well-being of them and their babies. They also value tests and treatments that are offered when they need them, and information and advice that is relevant to them. Our findings also suggest that healthcare staff want to be able to offer this kind of care.

However, given the high likelihood of benefits and the modest risks associated with this treatment, the review authors conclude that calcium antagonists, in the form of oral nimodipine 60 mg every four hours, are useful in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm.

However, when additional follow-up data were included in the analyses the difference in event-free survival remained statistically significant (three studies, 739 patients; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90), but the difference in overall survival was no longer statistically significant (two studies, 360 patients; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01). The meta-analysis of secondary malignant disease (A malignant tumor that has spread from its original (primary) site of growth to another site close to or distant from the primary site.)

No information on quality of life was reported. In the individual studies we evaluated different subgroups, but the results were not univocal in all studies. All studies had some methodological limitations. Based on the currently available evidence, myeloablative therapy (High-dose chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) that kills cells in the bone marrow, including cancer cells.) seems to work in terms of event-free survival. For overall survival there is currently no evidence of effect when additional follow-up data are included. No definitive conclusions can be made regarding adverse effects and quality of life, although possible higher levels of adverse effects should be kept in mind. A definitive conclusion regarding the effect of myeloablative therapy (High-dose chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) that kills cells in the bone marrow, including cancer cells.) in different subgroups is not possible. This systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy (High-dose chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) that kills cells in the bone marrow, including cancer cells.); no conclusions can be made regarding the best treatment strategy. Future trials on the use of myeloablative therapy (High-dose chemotherapy (The use of DRUGS to treat a DISEASE or its symptoms.) that kills cells in the bone marrow, including cancer cells.) for high-risk neuroblastoma (A common neoplasm of early childhood arising from neural crest cells in the sympathetic nervous system, and characterized by diverse clinical behavior, ranging from spontaneous remission to rapid metastatic progression and death.) should focus on identifying the most optimal induction and/or myeloablative regimen (infused.). The best study design to answer these questions is a RCT. These RCTs should be performed in homogeneous study populations (e.g. stage of disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) and patient age) and have a long-term follow-up. Different risk groups, using the most recent definitions, should be taken into account. It should be kept in mind that recently the age cut-off for high risk disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) was changed from one year to 18 months. As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate-risk disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) have been included in the high-risk groups. Consequently the relevance of the results of these studies to the current practice can be questioned. Survival rates may be overestimated due to the inclusion of patients with intermediate-risk disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).",

                "This systematic review focused on randomised studies comparing the effectiveness of myeloablative therapy with conventional therapy in children with high-risk neuroblastoma. The authors found three studies including 739 patients. These studies provide evidence that myeloablative therapy improves event-free survival (that is, the time until a certain event, for example tumour progression, the development of a second tumour, or death from any cause occurs). For overall survival (that is, the time until a patient dies from any cause, so not only from the tumour or its treatment, but for example, also from a car accident) there is no evidence of a better outcome in patients treated with myeloablative therapy. Side effects such as renal (kidney) effects, interstitial pneumonitis (a type of lung disease) and veno-occlusive disease (a condition in which some of the small veins in the liver are obstructed) were more common in patients treated with myeloablative therapy than conventional chemotherapy. It should be noted that this systematic review only allows a conclusion on the concept of myeloablative therapy; no conclusions regarding the best treatment strategy with regard to, for example, types of chemotherapeutic agents and the use of radiation therapy, could be made. More high quality research is needed. It should be noted that recently the age cut-off for high-risk disease was changed from one year to 18 months. As a result it is possible that patients with what is now classified as intermediate-risk disease were included in the high-risk groups.

All eight trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low certainty. The mean age ranged from 16 years to 78 years. The proportion of men ranged from 60% to 75% and the proportion of people with stage III primary hepatocellular carcinoma (Stage III includes: IIIA: (T3a, N0, M0); IIIB: (T3b, N0, M0); IIIC: (T4, N0, M0).) ranged from 22% to 85%. The median follow-up duration was 12 months (2 months to 38 months). TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may have reduced all-cause mortality at three years' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.88; 552 participants; 7 trials; low-certainty evidence). TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone may reduce the proportion of participants without tumour response (complete response plus partial response) (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.61; 632 participants; 8 trials; low-certainty evidence). Data, from one trial on health-related quality of life, favoured the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group, but the provided data were ill-defined (very low-certainty evidence). None of the trials reported serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). The results on non-serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were as follows: TACE followed by 3-DCRT compared with TACE alone showed no difference in the results for proportion of participants with leukopenia (A decrease in the number of LEUKOCYTES in a blood sample below the normal range (LEUKOCYTE COUNT less than 4000).)

However, the proportion of participants with total bilirubin (a degradation product of HEME.) elevation was larger in the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group than in the TACE alone group (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; 172 participants; 2 trials; very low-certainty evidence). The rate of participants with serum alpha-fetoprotein ( (The first alpha-globulins to appear in mammalian sera during FETAL DEVELOPMENT and the dominant serum proteins in early embryonic life.)AFP (The first alpha-globulins to appear in mammalian sera during FETAL DEVELOPMENT and the dominant serum proteins in early embryonic life.)) without decline or normalisation was significantly lower in the TACE followed by 3-DCRT group than in the TACE group, but these data were from one trial only (Chi\u00b2 = 7.24, P = 0.007; very low-certainty evidence). TACE followed by 3-DCRT may be associated with lower all-cause mortality and increased tumour response, despite the increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin (a degradation product of HEME.). Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials, resulting in low- to very low-certainty evidence. Data on serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) and health-related quality of life are lacking. We are also very much uncertain in the results of the reported non-serious adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.).

We collected and analysed data from randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of people with primary hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive TACE or 3-DCRT. Evidence is current to May 2018. The review included eight trials with 632 participants. All trials were at high risk of bias. TACE followed by 3-DCRT appeared to be superior to TACE in improving death from any cause and tumour response, despite an increased toxicity expressed by a higher rise of total bilirubin (measured by a blood test to see how well the liver is working). No trials reported serious side effects. One trial reported health-related quality of life (a measure of a person's satisfaction with their life and health), but this was ill-defined.

No evidence was found of a difference in inadvertent arterial puncture or other complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.).

We included 13 trials in this review with a total of 16,112 participants with a history of coronary heart disease or stroke. This review includes evidence identified up to October 2014. Our analysis showed that when compared primarily to placebo, fibrates can be effective for prevention of composite outcome of non-fatal stroke, non-fatal heart attack (myocardial infarction), and death due to circulatory disease. However, this beneficial effect relies on the inclusion on data from clofibrates, a drug that was discontinued in 2002 because of safety concerns. In other words, there is no good evidence to support the use of currently available fibrates in the prevention of future heart attacks, strokes, and circulatory disease death in people with existing circulatory disease. In combination with clofibrate data, quality of evidence was moderate for the composite (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death) and MI (non-fatal or fatal) outcomes and low for stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic, non-fatal or fatal) and death from vascular or any cause during the treatment and scheduled follow-up period.

The women in seven studies were trying to get pregnant from IUI, and from intercourse in two studies. Most women had a type of subfertility known as unexplained subfertility, which means that after having all routine tests done there is no obvious explanation for why the couple has not become pregnant so far. Eight trials compared intentional endometrial injury with no injury/placebo procedure; of these two trials also compared intentional endometrial injury in the cycle prior to IUI with intentional endometrial injury in the IUI cycle. One trial compared higher vs. lower degree of intentional endometrial injury. The evidence is current to 31 October 2015. The results from the included studies suggest a beneficial effect of endometrial injury on the chance of getting pregnant, but the studies are associated with many significant limitations. Therefore, it is not possible to say with any confidence whether endometrial injury can increase the probability of pregnancy. We are uncertain whether endometrial injury increases the probability of a live birth or a pregnancy beyond 12 weeks. The endometrial injury procedure is a common procedure and is known to cause a degree of temporary pain or discomfort. Only one included study reported on whether the women experienced pain during the procedure, and the average pain experienced was six out of 10 on a visual scale from zero to 10. Endometrial injury does not seem to have an effect on miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or multiple pregnancy. No studies reported bleeding after the procedure. The quality of the evidence was low or very low as assessed using GRADE criteria. In general, the studies included in this review were not very well designed and did not recruit a high enough number of women to provide meaningful results. This means the results must be treated cautiously, and further studies are needed to confirm the findings. There remains uncertainty about whether or not the endometrial injury procedure increases the probability of having a baby."

Forty-six patients were enrolled in the trial studying beclometasone dipropionate (The dipropionate ester of a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.)

There were no differences in clinical remission at 8 weeks (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.24; GRADE = low) and 12 months of treatment (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.40 to 4.18; GRADE = very low). Although patients receiving beclometasone dipropionate (The dipropionate ester of a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.) (84%) and mesalazine (active in INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.) (86%) achieved clinical remission at 8 weeks, it was not maintained at 12 months (26% and 20%, respectively). Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) reported in the budesonide (A glucocorticoid used in the management of ASTHMA, the treatment of various skin disorders, and allergic RHINITIS.) studies include nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.), vomiting (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.), neck pain (Discomfort or more intense forms of pain that are localized to the cervical region.), abdominal pain (Sensation of discomfort, distress, or agony in the abdominal region.), hyperhidrosis and headache (The symptom of PAIN in the cranial region.). Nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.) and skin rash (Diseases in which skin eruptions or rashes are a prominent manifestation.) were reported as adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) in the mesalazine (active in INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.) study. Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) in the beclometasone dipropionate (The dipropionate ester of a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.) trial include nausea (An unpleasant sensation in the stomach usually accompanied by the urge to vomit.), sleepiness and change of mood. No adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were reported in the bismuth (A metallic element that has the atomic symbol Bi, and atomic number 83.) subsalicylate (A bismuth salt of salicylic acid.) study. Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide (A glucocorticoid used in the management of ASTHMA, the treatment of various skin disorders, and allergic RHINITIS.) may be effective for the treatment of active lymphocytic colitis (A subtype of MICROSCOPIC COLITIS, characterized by chronic watery DIARRHEA of unknown origin, a normal COLONOSCOPY but abnormal histopathology on BIOPSY.) (A subtype of MICROSCOPIC COLITIS, characterized by chronic watery DIARRHEA of unknown origin, a normal COLONOSCOPY but abnormal histopathology on BIOPSY.). This benefit needs to be confirmed by a large placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) -controlled trial.

No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth (A metallic element that has the atomic symbol Bi, and atomic number 83.) subsalicylate (A bismuth salt of salicylic acid.) due to the very small number of patients in the study, Further trials studying interventions for lymphocytic colitis (A subtype of MICROSCOPIC COLITIS, characterized by chronic watery DIARRHEA of unknown origin, a normal COLONOSCOPY but abnormal histopathology on BIOPSY.) are warranted.",

                "Five studies including 149 participants were identified. These studies assessed budesonide versus placebo (e.g. a sugar pill), mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine and Pepto-Bismol\u00ae versus placebo. The study which compared mesalazine to mesalazine plus cholestyramine and the study which compared beclometasone dipropionate to mesalazine were judged to be of low quality. The study which compared Pepto-Bismol\u00ae bismuth subsalicylate to a placebo was judged as low quality due to a very small sample size (5 participants) and limited data. The other three studies were judged to be high quality. A pooled analysis of two studies (57 participants) showed that budesonide (9 mg/day for 6 to 8 weeks) was superior to placebo for improvement of diarrhea and improvement of microscopic inflammation of the bowel. Improvement in diarrhea was noted in 88% of budesonide participants compared to 38% of placebo participants. Improvement in microscopic inflammation was reported in 78% of budesonide participants compared to 33% of placebo participants. Forty-one participants were enrolled in the study that compared mesalazine (2.4. g/day) to mesalazine plus cholestyramine (4 g/day). Improvement in diarrhea was noted in 85% of participants in the mesalazine group compared to 86% of participants in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine group. Five patients were enrolled in the trial studying Pepto-Bismol\u00ae (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks versus placebo). There were no differences in improvement of diarrhea or in improvement of microscopic inflammation of the bowel. Forty-six participants were enrolled in the trial studying beclometasone dipropionate (5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) versus mesalazine (2.4 g/day). Although participants receiving beclometasone dipropionate (84%) and mesalazine (86%) had improved diarrhea at 8 weeks, this improvement was not maintained at 12 months (26% and 20%, respectively). Side effects reported in the budesonide studies include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, abdominal pain, excessive sweating and headache. Side effects reported in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine study included nausea and skin rash. Side effects in the beclometasone dipropionate trial included nausea, sleepiness and change of mood. No side effects were reported in the Pepto-Bismol\u00ae study. Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide may be an effective therapy for the treatment of lymphocytic colitis. Low quality evidence also suggests that mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may be effective for treatment of lymphocytic colitis. No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth subsalicylate due to the very small number of participants in the study. In the future, researchers should consider further large placebo-controlled trials of budesonide to confirm the suggested benefit and safety of this therapy. Bismuth subsalicylate, which has less potential for toxicity than budesonide, also warrants further study. The effectiveness and safety of mesalazine with or without cholestyramine, and beclometasone dipropionate need to be investigated in a large placebo-controlled studies."

Intervention duration ranged from 6 months (26 weeks) to 12 months (52 weeks). Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMBG with SMUG, one study was a three-armed trial comparing SMBG and SMUG with usual care and one study was a three-armed trial comparing less intensive SMBG and more intensive SMBG with a control group. Seven out of 11 studies had a low risk of bias for most indicators. Meta-analysis of studies including patients with a diabetes duration of one year or more showed a statistically significant SMBG induced decrease in HbA1c (Products of non-enzymatic reactions between GLUCOSE and HEMOGLOBIN A, occurring as a minor fraction of the hemoglobin components of human erythrocytes.) at up to six months follow-up (-0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; 2324 participants, nine trials), yet an overall statistically non-significant SMBG induced decrease was seen at 12 month follow-up (-0.1; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.04; 493 participants, two trials). Qualitative analysis of the effect of SMBG on well-being and quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. Two trials reported costs of self-monitoring: One trial compared the costs of self-monitoring of blood glucose (Glucose in blood.) with self-monitoring of urine glucose based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US (The visualization of deep structures of the body by recording the reflections or echoes of ultrasonic pulses directed into the tissues.) dollars for self-monitoring in 1990. Authors concluded that total costs in the first year of self-monitoring of blood glucose (Glucose in blood.), with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]). Another trial reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self-monitoring. At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) were \u00a389 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), \u00a3181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self-monitoring group and \u00a3173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self-monitoring group. Higher losses to follow-up in the more intensive self-monitoring group were responsible for the difference in costs, compared to the less intensive self-monitoring group. There were few data on the effects on other outcomes and these effects were not statistically significant. None of the studies reported data on morbidity. From this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose (Glucose in blood.) on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels.) who are not using insulin (A 51-amino acid pancreatic hormone that plays a major role in the regulation of glucose metabolism, directly by suppressing endogenous glucose production (GLYCOGENOLYSIS; GLUCONEOGENESIS) and indirectly by suppressing GLUCAGON secretion and LIPOLYSIS.) is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. Furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that SMBG affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of SMBG on hypoglycaemia (A syndrome of abnormally low BLOOD GLUCOSE level.) and diabetic complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.).",

However, hypoglycaemic episodes were more often reported in the self-monitoring blood glucose groups than in the control groups (four studies). Because patients in the self-monitoring blood glucose groups can use their device to confirm both periods of asymptomatic and symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes, this is according to expectations."

Contingency management plus standard maintenance was superior for drug misuse for outpatients with cocaine dependence (A psychologically and socially impaired state, with or without physiological changes, that develops as a result of using cocaine and which leads to compulsive behaviors to acquire the substance.) in one study but not in another, possibly because of differences in the behavioural intervention (The application of modern theories of learning and conditioning in the treatment of behavior disorders.)

Each of these intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s had been originally developed for people with substance misuse problems. Significant improvements were mainly confined to outcomes related to substance misuse.

Only three studies reported outcome measures that were originally defined in the review protocol as being of particular importance in this disorder (reconviction and aggression). Nonetheless, there was some evidence that a type of treatment known as contingency management (which provides rewards for progress in treatment) could help people with antisocial personality disorder to reduce their misuse of drugs or alcohol. Further research is urgently needed to clarify which psychological treatments are effective for people with this disorder. This research is best carried out using carefully designed clinical trials.

Streptococcus bacteria were found in the throats of 14% of people. We classed outcomes measured within eight weeks of the start of treatment as short-term, and those measured at least one year after the start of treatment as long-term. The antibiotic trials in guttate psoriasis patients were all short-term in duration; the antibiotic trial in chronic plaque psoriasis was 48 weeks long. Three studies included participants with guttate psoriasis, and assessed the short-term effects of antibiotics: penicillin (20 participants), or erythromycin compared to no treatment (43 participants), and rifampicin compared to placebo (20 participants). Two studies included participants with chronic plaque psoriasis. One study assessed azithromycin (antibiotic) versus vitamin C at 48 weeks (50 participants); one assessed tonsillectomy versus no intervention at eight weeks and 24 months (29 participants). These results are backed by very low-quality evidence, so we are not certain of their accuracy. Each result is based on only one study. No studies measured our main outcome of interest, the time taken for the skin to be clear or almost clear of lesions, or the risk of relapsing at least once during long-term follow-up. No side effects were seen when penicillin was compared with no treatment in people with guttate psoriasis. Side effects were not measured for the comparisons of rifampicin versus placebo, or erythromycin versus no treatment. In participants with chronic plaque psoriasis, one trial assessed azithromycin versus vitamin C, and 10 participants in the azithromycin group complained of nausea or mild stomach upset. A trial of tonsillectomy versus no treatment reported one case of minor bleeding in the tonsillectomy group. Two studies in participants with chronic plaque psoriasis measured the number of participants achieving a 75% reduction on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75). In one, 18/30 participants in the azithromycin group reached PASI 75 versus none in the vitamin C group. In the other, 3/15 in the tonsillectomy group reached PASI 75 versus none in the no treatment group. The guttate psoriasis trials did not assess this outcome. We are uncertain whether the number of participants with guttate psoriasis achieving clear or almost clear skin differs between those given penicillin and those receiving no treatment. Only one participant with chronic plaque psoriasis achieved almost clear skin in the tonsillectomy group compared to none in the no treatment group. The other three trials did not measure this outcome. Many of our main outcomes were not assessed. Those that were assessed were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are not sure of their accuracy. The studies were very small, and had a high risk of bias because participants and trial assessors were aware of treatment allocation. More studies are needed to see if antibiotic treatment of Streptococcal infection shortens the duration of acute guttate psoriasis, stopping it from turning into a long-term condition (chronic plaque psoriasis)."

            "input": "We identified seven new studies in this update. We excluded six, and one study is ongoing so also not included in this update. This review contains a total of 62 included studies, with 4241 participants. Thirty-six studies used a cross-over design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) number (11) for seven days for each arm of the trial. Overall we judged the included studies to be at high risk of bias because the methods of randomisation and allocation concealment were poorly reported. The primary outcomes for this review were participant-reported pain and pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.). Fifteen studies compared oral morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) modified release (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).)

Fourteen studies compared Mm/r in different strengths; six of these included 24-hour modified release (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).) products. Fifteen studies compared Mm/r with other opioids (Compounds with activity like OPIATE ALKALOIDS, acting at OPIOID RECEPTORS.). Six studies compared MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).) with other opioids (Compounds with activity like OPIATE ALKALOIDS, acting at OPIOID RECEPTORS.). Two studies compared oral Mm/r with rectal Mm/r. Three studies compared MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).) with MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).) by a different route of administration. Two studies compared Mm/r with Mm/r at different times and two compared MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).) with MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).) given at a different time. One study was found comparing each of the following: Mm/r tablet with Mm/r suspension; Mm/r with non-opioids (Compounds with activity like OPIATE ALKALOIDS, acting at OPIOID RECEPTORS.); MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).) with non-opioids (Compounds with activity like OPIATE ALKALOIDS, acting at OPIOID RECEPTORS.); and oral morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) with epidural morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.). In the previous update, a standard of 'no worse than mild pain' was set, equivalent to a score of 30/100 mm or less on a visual analogue (A pain scale marked off like a ruler from 0 to 10 on which the patient marks the current level of pain experienced.) pain intensity scale (VAS (A pain scale marked off like a ruler from 0 to 10 on which the patient marks the current level of pain experienced.)), or the equivalent in other pain scales (A device designed for weighing or an indicator device with a graduated sequence of divisions.). Eighteen studies achieved this level of pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.) on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.) were not attained. Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, 'no worse than mild pain' was achieved by 96% of participants (362/377), and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in 63% (400/638). Morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) is an effective analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) for cancer pain (Pain that may be caused by or related to cellular, tissue, and systemic changes that occur during NEOPLASM growth, tissue invasion, and METASTASIS.). Pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.) did not differ between Mm/r and MIR (Small double-stranded, non-protein coding RNAs, 21-25 nucleotides in length generated from single-stranded microRNA gene transcripts by the same RIBONUCLEASE III, Dicer, that produces small interfering RNAs (RNA, SMALL INTERFERING).). Modified release versions of morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the formulation. Daily doses in studies ranged from 25 mg to 2000 mg with an average of between 100 mg and 250 mg. Dose titration (Titration) was undertaken with both instant release and modified release (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).) products. A small number of participants did not achieve adequate analgesia (A form of therapy that employs a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those experiencing pain.) with morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.). Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were common, predictable, and approximately 6% of participants discontinued treatment with morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) because of intolerable adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.). The quality of the evidence is generally poor. Studies are old, often small, and were largely carried out for registration purposes and therefore were only designed to show equivalence between different formulations. The conclusions have not changed for this update. The effectiveness of oral morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) has stood the test (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) of time, but the randomised trial literature for morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) is small given the importance of this medicine (Drugs intended for human or veterinary use, presented in their finished dosage form.). Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for meta-analysis. Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief (A lessening of pain following an intervention.), but where it was reported, over 90% had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time period. The review demonstrates the wide dose range of morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) used in studies, and that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.). The review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in cross-over designs. Trial design was frequently based on titration (Titration) of morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) or comparator to achieve adequate analgesia (A form of therapy that employs a coordinated and interdisciplinary approach for easing the suffering and improving the quality of life of those experiencing pain.), then crossing participants over in cross-over design studies. It was not clear if these trials were sufficiently powered to detect any clinical differences between formulations or comparator drugs. New studies added to the review for the previous update reinforced the view that it is possible to use modified release (A solid, semi-solid, solution or suspension exhibiting an altered inherent rate of release of active and/or inert ingredient(s).) morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) to titrate to analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) effect. There is qualitative evidence that oral morphine (The principal alkaloid in opium and the prototype opiate analgesic (Compounds capable of relieving pain without the loss of CONSCIOUSNESS.) and narcotic.) has much the same efficacy as other available opioids (Compounds with activity like OPIATE ALKALOIDS, acting at OPIOID RECEPTORS.).",

                "In this updated review we set out to estimate how well morphine worked, how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were \u2013 for example, whether they were so severe that participants stopped taking their oral morphine. We found 62 studies with 4241 participants. The studies were often small, compared many different preparations, and used different study designs. This made it difficult to work out whether any one tablet or preparation of oral morphine was better than any other. There did not seem to be much difference between them. More than 9 in 10 participants had pain that went from moderate or severe before taking morphine to pain that was no worse than mild when taking morphine. More than 6 in 10 participants were very satisfied with the morphine treatment, or considered the result to be very good or excellent. Only about 1 person in 20 stopped taking morphine because of side effects. Morphine is associated with some unwanted effects, mainly constipation, and nausea and vomiting. At one level these are good results. On another level, the quality of studies is generally poor and we could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels \u2013 no worse than mild pain \u2013 so that people with cancer are not bothered by pain."

The average duration of symptoms ranged from three to 15 months, and the follow-up after the procedure (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) ranged from eight weeks to 23 months. The studies reported nine types of comparisons: open surgery versus steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injections (two studies); percutaneous surgery (Operative procedure (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s performed on the SKIN.) versus steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection (five studies); open surgery versus steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection plus ultrasound-guided hyaluronic acid injection (one study); percutaneous surgery (Operative procedure (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s performed on the SKIN.) plus steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection versus steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection (one study); percutaneous surgery (Operative procedure (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s performed on the SKIN.) versus open surgery (five studies); endoscopic surgery (A surgical procedure (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) done with the use or assistance of an endoscopic device.) versus open surgery (one study); and three comparisons of types of incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) for open surgery (transverse incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) of the skin in the distal palmar crease, transverse incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) of the skin about 2\u20133 mm distally from distal palmar crease, and longitudinal incision (An intentional cut made to an individual's body with the intent of performing a diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.) of the skin) (one study). Most studies had significant methodological flaws and were considered at high or unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias, detection bias (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) and reporting bias. The primary comparison was open surgery versus steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injections, because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection is the least invasive control treatment method (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) as reported in the studies in this review and is often used as first-line treatment (The preferred standard treatment for a particular condition.) in clinical practice. Compared with steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection, there was low-quality evidence that open surgery provides benefits with respect to less triggering recurrence, although it has the disadvantage of being more pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.)ful (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.). Evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws and imprecision. Based on two trials (270 participants) from six up to 12 months, 50/130 (or 385 per 1000) individuals had recurrence of trigger finger (Four or five slender jointed digits in humans and primates, attached to each HAND.) in the steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection group compared with 8/140 (or 65 per 1000; range 35 to 127) in the open surgery group, RR 0.17 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.33), for an absolute risk difference that 29% fewer people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery (60% fewer to 3% more individuals); relative change translates to improvement of 83% in the open surgery group (67% to 91% better). At one week, 9/49 (184 per 1000) people had pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) on the palm of the hand (The distal part of the arm beyond the wrist in humans and primates, that includes the palm, fingers, and thumb.) in the steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection group compared with 38/56 (or 678 per 1000; ranging from 366 to 1000) in the open surgery group, RR 3.69 (95% CI 1.99 to 6.85), for an absolute risk difference that 49% more had pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) with open surgery (33% to 66% more); relative change translates to worsening of 269% (585% to 99% worse) (one trial, 105 participants). Because of very low quality evidence from two trials we are uncertain whether open surgery improve resolution (Return to the normal structure and/or function, e.g.) of trigger finger (Four or five slender jointed digits in humans and primates, attached to each HAND.) in the follow-up at six to 12 months, when compared with steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection (131/140 observed in the open surgery group compared with 80/130 in the control group; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.76); evidence was downgraded due to study design flaws, inconsistency and imprecision. Low-quality evidence from two trials and few event rates (270 participants) from six up to 12 months of follow-up, we are uncertain whether open surgery increased the risk of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) (incidence of infection (An illness caused by an infectious agent or its toxins that occurs through the direct or indirect transmission of the infectious agent or its products from an infected individual or via an animal, vector or the inanimate environment to a susceptible animal or human host.), tendon injury, flare, cutaneous discomfort and fat necrosis (A condition in which the death of adipose tissue results in neutral fats being split into fatty acids and glycerol.))

Twelve participants (8 versus 4) did not complete the follow-up, and it was considered that they did not have a positive outcome in the data analysis. We are uncertain whether open surgery was more effective than steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection in improving hand (The distal part of the arm beyond the wrist in humans and primates, that includes the palm, fingers, and thumb.) function or participant satisfaction as studies did not report these outcomes. Low-quality evidence indicates that, compared with steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injection, open surgical treatment (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) in people with trigger finger (Four or five slender jointed digits in humans and primates, attached to each HAND.), may result in a less recurrence rate from six up to 12 months following the treatment, although it increases the incidence of pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) during the first follow-up week. We are uncertain about the effect of open surgery with regard to the resolution (Return to the normal structure and/or function, e.g.) rate in follow-up at six to 12 months, compared with steroid (A group of polycyclic compounds closely related biochemically to TERPENES.) injections, due high heterogeneity and few events occurred in the trials; we are uncertain too about the risk of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) and neurovascular injury because of a few events occurred in the studies.

                "This Cochrane Review is current to August 2017. We included 14 randomised controlled trials involving 1260 participants, totalling 1361 trigger fingers. Two studies compared open surgery versus steroid injections, five studies compared percutaneous surgery versus steroid injection, one study compared open surgery versus steroid injection plus hyaluronic acid injection, one study compared percutaneous surgery plus steroid injection versus steroid injection, five studies compared percutaneous surgery versus open surgery, one study compared endoscopic surgery versus open surgery and one study compared three types of skin incision to open surgery. The majority of participants were female (about 70%); they were aged between 16 and 88 years; and the mean follow-up of participants after the procedure was eight weeks to 23 months. Due to space constraints, the reporting of all results was limited to the main comparison \u2014 open surgery versus steroid injection \u2014 because open surgery is the oldest and the most widely used treatment method and considered as standard surgery, whereas steroid injection is the least invasive control treatment method as reported in the studies in this review and is often used as first-line treatment in clinical practice. Based on two trial (270 participants), compared with the steroid injection procedure: Resolution of trigger finger (lessening of symptoms with no recurrence): \u2022 92 out of 100 people had resolution of symptoms with open surgery. \u2022 61 out of 100 people had resolution of symptoms with steroid injection. Incidence of pain, assessed as the presence or absence of pain after the procedure was performed (at one week): \u2022 49% more people had pain with open surgery (33% to 66% more). \u2022 68 out of 100 people had pain with open surgery. \u2022 19 out of 100 people had pain with steroid injection. Recurrence of the trigger finger (from six to 12 months): \u2022 29% fewer people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery (60% fewer to 3% more). \u2022 7 out of 100 people had recurrence of symptoms with open surgery. \u2022 39 out of 100 people had recurrence of symptoms with steroid injection. Adverse events: Adverse events including infections, tendon injuries, cutaneous discomfort, flare or fat necrosis at the procedure site, or neovascular events were uncommon in either treatment group. No study reported hand function or participant-reported treatment success or satisfaction. Very low quality evidence from two trials means we are uncertain whether open surgery improve resolution of trigger finger in comparison with steroid injection, due the risk of bias in the design of the studies, inconsistencies between studies and the small number of participants in studies. Low-quality evidence from two trials shows that open surgery may result in fewer recurrences of trigger finger compared with steroid injection procedure, although it increases the incidence of pain during the first week after the procedure. Evidence was downgraded to 'low' due to the risk of bias in the design and the small number of participants. No studies measured functional improvement or participant satisfaction in the comparison between open surgery and steroid injection. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events or neurovascular injury between treatments, as few events occurred in the studies. Only low and very low-quality evidence was found for other comparisons so we are uncertain if percutaneous surgery has any benefits over steroid injection, or if open surgery is better than steroid plus hyaluronic acid, or if one type of surgery is better than another."

None of the studies blinded participants or personnel, and, therefore, are considered at high risk of performance and detection (The activity of perceiving, discerning, discovering or identifying.) bias. The studies were otherwise at low risk of bias. One study, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.)C) trial, demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit for RT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.) plus PCV (The volume of packed RED BLOOD CELLS in a blood specimen.), with a median OS of 3.5 years compared with 2.6 years in the RT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.) alone arm (P value = 0.018). This result was reported 10 years after the conclusion of the enrolment, and was not apparent in the original 2008 Cochrane review. Furthermore, with retrospective evaluation of biomarkers, codeletion of complete chromosome arms 1p and 19q and IDH-1 or -2 mutation were independent prognostic factors for OS in two of the RCTs (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.)OG) and EORT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.)C), and were predictive for OS in one trial (RT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.)OG). The third trial (NOA-04) evaluated these biomarkers prospectively and found them prognostic for progression-free survival. Early PCV (The volume of packed RED BLOOD CELLS in a blood specimen.), either before or after RT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.), appears to improve OS of participants with AO or AOA. Use of biomarkers including codeletion of chromosomes 1p (Proximal (short) arm of chromosome 1) and 19q with or without IDH-1 or -2 mutation identify a subset of people with increased sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) to combined PCV (The volume of packed RED BLOOD CELLS in a blood specimen.) and RT (A part of the lower limb, located between the hip and the knee and located on the right side of the body.). The important role of biomarkers was supported in all of the RCTs examined, and prospective evaluation should be undertaken in future studies. However, PCV (The volume of packed RED BLOOD CELLS in a blood specimen.) was associated with significant grade 3 and 4 toxicities, and whether temozolomide (used as an alkylating antineoplastic agent for the treatment of MALIGNANT GLIOMA and MALIGNANT MELANOMA.) can be substituted (Class of organic compounds that consist of urea and other compounds including Sulfonyl compounds and have application in pharmaceutical and agricultural preparation.) for this remains unclear.",

Three randomized controlled trials, which included 931 participants, assessed the role of chemotherapy alone or in addition to radiotherapy, or radiotherapy alone. One study was able to demonstrate a significant survival benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery, compared with radiotherapy alone. In addition, during examination of these brain tumour biopsy specimens, they found specific chromosome deletions and mutations in two studies, which helped to identify a group of participants with better survival outcomes. Furthermore, in one study, these specific chromosome deletions and mutations predicted which group of participants derived benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy after surgery.

(AHI 1 to 30 per hour). All trials were performed in specialised sleep medicine clinics at tertiary care centres. Follow-up time ranged from six weeks to four months. Three RCTs (n = 137) compared intranasal steroids against placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.); two RCTs compared oral montelukast (The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of asthma, such as trouble breathing, tight chest, wheezing, coughing, and runny nose.) against placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (n = 103). We excluded one trial from the meta-analysis since the patients were not analysed as randomised. We also had concerns about selective reporting in another trial. We are uncertain about the difference in AHI (MD \u22123.18, 95% CI \u22128.70 to 2.35) between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) (2 studies, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence). In contrast, children receiving oral montelukast (The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of asthma, such as trouble breathing, tight chest, wheezing, coughing, and runny nose.) had a lower AHI (MD \u22123.41, 95% CI \u22125.36 to \u22121.45) compared to those in the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group (2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether the secondary outcomes are different between children receiving intranasal corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) compared to placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.): desaturation index (MD \u22122.12, 95% CI \u22124.27 to 0.04; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), respiratory arousal index (MD \u22120.71, 95% CI \u22126.25 to 4.83; 2 studies, 75 participants; low-certainty evidence), and nadir oxygen saturation (The determination of oxygen-hemoglobin saturation of blood either by withdrawing a sample and passing it through a classical photoelectric oximeter or by electrodes attached to some translucent part of the body like finger, earlobe, or skin fold.) (MD 0.59%, 95% CI \u22121.09 to 2.27; 2 studies, 75 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Children receiving oral montelukast (The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of asthma, such as trouble breathing, tight chest, wheezing, coughing, and runny nose.) had a lower respiratory arousal index (MD \u22122.89, 95% CI \u22124.68 to \u22121.10; 2 studies, 103 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and nadir of oxygen saturation (MD 4.07, 95% CI 2.27 to 5.88; 2 studies, 103 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those in the placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group. We are uncertain, however, about the difference in desaturation index (MD \u22122.50, 95% CI \u22125.53 to 0.54; 2 studies, 103 participants; low-certainty evidence) between the montelukast (The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of asthma, such as trouble breathing, tight chest, wheezing, coughing, and runny nose.) and placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) group. Adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were assessed and reported in all trials and were rare, of minor nature (e.g. nasal bleeding (Bleeding from the nose.)), and evenly distributed between study groups. No study examined the avoidance of surgical treatment (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) for OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) as an outcome. There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).) for the treatment of OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) in children; they may have short-term beneficial effects on the desaturation index and oxygen saturation in children with mild to moderate OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) but the certainty of the benefit on the primary outcome AHI, as well as the respiratory arousal index, was low due to imprecision of the estimates and heterogeneity between studies. Montelukast (The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of asthma, such as trouble breathing, tight chest, wheezing, coughing, and runny nose.) has short-term beneficial treatment effects for OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) in otherwise healthy, non-obese, surgically untreated children (moderate certainty for primary outcome and moderate and high certainty, respectively, for two secondary outcomes) by significantly reducing the number of apnoeas (A transient absence of spontaneous respiration.), hypopnoeas, and respiratory arousals during sleep. In addition, montelukast (The active ingredient in a drug used to treat symptoms of asthma, such as trouble breathing, tight chest, wheezing, coughing, and runny nose.) was well tolerated in the children studied. The clinical relevance of the observed treatment effects remains unclear, however, because minimal clinically important differences are not yet established for polysomnography-based outcomes in children. Long-term efficacy and safety data on the use of anti-inflammatory medications (Substances that reduce or suppress INFLAMMATION.) for the treatment of OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) in childhood are still not available. In addition, patient-centred outcomes like concentration ability, vigilance, or school performance have not been investigated yet. There are currently no RCTs on the use of other kinds of anti-inflammatory medications (Substances that reduce or suppress INFLAMMATION.) for the treatment of OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) in children. Future RCTs should investigate sustainability of treatment effects, avoidance of surgical treatment (Operations carried out for the correction of deformities and defects, repair of injuries, and diagnosis and cure of certain diseases.) for OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.), and long-term safety of anti-inflammatory medications (Substances that reduce or suppress INFLAMMATION.) for the treatment of OSA (A disorder characterized by recurrent apneas during sleep despite persistent respiratory efforts.) in children and include patient-centred outcomes.",

These studies each included 25 to 62 children between one and 11 years of age with mild to moderate OSA treated at specialised sleep outpatient clinics. The included studies used two different types of anti-inflammatory medications. Seventy-five children were randomised to receive either intranasal corticosteroid nasal spray or placebo. One hundred and three children were randomised to either montelukast tablet or placebo. Three studies were supported by drug manufacturers. We are uncertain about the difference in the number of breathing pauses, episodes of shallow breathing, episodes with a lack of blood oxygen, or sleep disruption between children receiving corticosteroid nasal spray compared to placebo (2 studies involving 75 children). Children receiving montelukast tablets had fewer breathing pauses, fewer episodes of shallow breathing, and less sleep disruption compared to those treated with placebo (2 studies involving 103 children). However, we are uncertain about the difference in the number of episodes with a lack of blood oxygen between the montelukast and placebo group. Unintended effects were assessed in all trials, but were rare and of minor nature (e.g. nosebleeds). Serious unintended effects were not reported. The certainty of the evidence for corticosteroid nasal spray for the treatment of OSA was low for the primary outcome due to the wide range of the beneficial effect with some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. We excluded one study from the analysis due to serious concerns about the quality of the study results. The evidence for the use of montelukast tablets in the treatment of OSA was of moderate certainty for the primary outcome. There were concerns about the design and conduct of one study and some inconsistency of the effect between the two included studies. The evidence is current to October 2019."

The clearance rate between oral PUVA (Phototherapy that combines the use of psoralen with UVA light as a treatment for various skin conditions.) (Phototherapy that combines the use of psoralen with UVA light as a treatment for various skin conditions.) and NB-UVB is inconsistent among the included studies.

Re-NB-UVB and re-PUVA (Phototherapy that combines the use of psoralen with UVA light as a treatment for various skin conditions.) are similarly effective for treating people with CPP or GP. In practice, NB-UVB may be more convenient to use since exogenous photosensitiser is not required before phototherapy (Treatment of disease by exposure to light, especially by variously concentrated light rays or specific wavelengths.). NB-UVB is considered ineffective for PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.) in clinical practice, and a small RCT did not detect a statistically significant difference between NB-UVB and topical PUVA (Phototherapy that combines the use of psoralen with UVA light as a treatment for various skin conditions.) for clearing PPP (characterized by rapid attachment loss and bone destruction in the presence of little local factors such as DENTAL PLAQUE and DENTAL CALCULUS.). NB-UVB seemed to be similar to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of NB-UVB.",

                "This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality. For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB-UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA. Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side-effects. In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate. In summary, NB-UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB-UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB-UVB and conventional BB-UVB is limited. The long-term safety of NB-UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB-UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies."

Evidence shows that aripiprazole (A quinoline derivate and atypical anti-psychotic agent.) was more effective than placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) in reducing manic symptoms in adults and children/adolescents at three and four weeks but not at six weeks (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS); mean difference (MD) at three weeks (random effects) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.82 to -2.05; six studies; N = 1819, moderate quality evidence) - a modest difference.

At the three-week time point, meta-analysis was not possible because of lack of data; however, at 12 weeks, haloperidol (used primarily to treat SCHIZOPHRENIA and other PSYCHOSES.) resulted in significantly more movement disorders (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.)

                "Ten studies are included (3340 participants). Most studies compared aripiprazole versus placebo, but some researchers compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (two studies) and versus lithium (one study). Two studies examined the effect of adding aripiprazole to another treatment (valproate or lithium) and compared this combination versus placebo combined with these other treatments. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the ten studies as unclear. The main measure of effect was the mean change on the Young Mania Rating Scale from the start to the end of the trial; this tool is used by clinicians to assess the severity of mania. After three weeks of treatment, aripiprazole was better than placebo at reducing the severity of mania when used on its own or when added to other mood stabilisers. The effect was modest. However, aripiprazole caused more inner restlessness (akathisia), nausea, and constipation than placebo. Aripiprazole was similarly effective in reducing the symptoms of mania when compared with other drug treatments (haloperidol and lithium). Aripiprazole caused fewer movement disorders and less raised prolactin (a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland) than haloperidol. People taking aripiprazole were more likely to remain on treatment than those taking haloperidol but were no more or less likely than those taking placebo or lithium. The main reason for the difference in dropouts between aripiprazole and haloperidol groups was the adverse effects associated with haloperidol. In summary, aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania when compared with placebo. This finding is based on studies that included mixed populations (i.e. children, adolescents and adults). For the adult population, studies have directly compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol, lithium and placebo, but evidence obtained for treatment of the child and adolescent population is available only from placebo-controlled studies. Given the lack of evidence obtained by comparing aripiprazole versus other drugs, its exact place in therapy is unclear. Further studies focused on particular populations are needed to determine whether this treatment is equally effective in different age groups."

Fifteen randomised controlled trials (1660 participants) looking at the effectiveness of patient education strategies for neck disorders were included. Of the 15 selected trials, only one trial depicting moderate quality evidence favoured the educational video for acute WAD. The remaining trials showed that patient education trials did not demonstrate evidence of benefit or favoured the comparison treatment being exercise for pain. Other outcomes were less frequently reported and did not yield results that diverged from those associated with pain. Participants who received advice to stay active reported little or no difference in pain compared with those who received no treatment, treatments focusing on rest, treatments focusing on exercise, physiotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. Additionally, stress-management therapies, when compared with no treatment, did not seem to have an effect on pain intensity in patients with mechanical neck disorders. Finally, self-care strategies (ergonomics, exercise, self-care, relaxation) do not seem to have an effect on pain when compared with no treatment. No adverse events were reported in the trials. In summary, the review authors concluded that there is no strong evidence for the effectiveness of educational interventions in various neck disorders."

Although we searched widely to identify all relevant research evaluating the effects of interventions to communicate with (notify and support) people at risk, we did not identify any studies that met the criteria for inclusion in this Cochrane review. However, systematic searches did identify a number of pieces of relevant research and literature that provided evidence about policy implementation and consumer experiences in situations of iatrogenic exposure to risk. This research formed the basis of a thematic synthesis. The synthesis identified several activities that aim to improve the experiences of people at risk of CJD and vCJD. It indicates that communication may be best considered as a longitudinal multicomponent programme occurring over time, ensuring that notification is coordinated and considers impact; that support is in place and is offered over time; that communication is flexible, tailored and responsive to need; and that supporting activities, such as widespread education of the healthcare workforce, the public and the media, and monitoring of access to health care for those at risk, are in place. The thematic synthesis also indicates that poor communication practices may have negative impacts or cause harm, such as discrimination in accessing health care.

Researchers used the International RLS severity scale to find out if patients were improved after 12 weeks of treatment. Particpants receiving the combined oxycodone and naloxone reported improvement in RLS symptoms, Quality of life, and sleep quality; 42% of the drug group were symptom-free. Discussion The study was well designed overall, but was at a high risk of bias due to the high percentage of participants who withdrew from treatment (attrition bias). Eighty-four percent of the drug group developed adverse events, which were mostly related to the gastrointestinal system, headache, fatigue, and sleepiness (somnolence); 9.8% left the study because of the adverse events. Conclusion The use of opioids for the treatment of RLS in patients resistant to conventional treatment is supported by low-quality evidence. Prescription of these medications should be based on clinical experience, and caution used due to the potential for abuse, dependency, and adverse events. No patient on opioids complained that their symptoms worsened."

Weak methodology, such as using inadequate methods of randomisation and outcome assessment, means that the possibility of serious bias can not be excluded. The review found that external fixation reduced fracture redisplacement that prompted further treatment and generally improved final anatomical outcome. It appears to improve function too but this needs to be confirmed. The complications, such a pin tract infection, associated with external fixation were many but were generally minor. Serious complications occurred in both groups. The review concludes that there is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for these fractures."

                "We searched medical and dental sources for studies up to 21 January 2015. We identified five relevant studies. They were at high risk of bias because the participants knew which treatment they received and so did the people who treated them. Four studies compared crowns with fillings. Two of them compared metal crowns fitted using the conventional method with fillings and two compared metal crowns fitted using the Hall Technique with fillings. One of the studies also compared the Hall Technique with 'non-restorative caries treatment' (not using either a filling or crown but opening the cavity to make it possible to clean with a toothbrush, sealing with fluoride varnish and encouraging toothbrushing). The final study compared crowns made of two different materials (stainless steel versus stainless steel with a white covering). We looked at what happened for each treatment at the time of the dental appointment or within 24 hours of treatment, in the short term (less than 12 months) and long term (12 months to 48 months). Teeth restored with preformed crowns are less likely to develop problems (e.g. abscess) or cause pain in the long term, compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique (no injections or tooth trimming) gave less discomfort at the time of the appointment, when compared with fillings. Crowns may increase the risk of gingival bleeding but this result was unclear. Only one small study compared crowns with non-restorative caries treatment and one small study compared metal and white crowns, and we could draw no reliable conclusions from these. Some of our outcomes of interest were not measured in any of the studies: these included time to restoration failure or retreatment, patient satisfaction and costs. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns are more effective than fillings for managing decay in primary molar teeth. There is moderate quality evidence that crowns fitted using the Hall Technique are less likely to cause abscesses and pain than fillings. The evidence comparing preformed crowns with non-restorative caries management, and comparing preformed metal crowns with preformed white crowns, is very low quality so we do not know which is better. Crowns placed on primary molar teeth with decay, or that have had pulp treatment, are likely to reduce the risk of major failure or pain in the long term compared to fillings. Crowns fitted using the Hall Technique may reduce discomfort at the time of treatment compared to fillings."

Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform any meta-analysis. In 22 of the 28 studies the PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) technique was performed using a mask (Devices that cover the nose and mouth to maintain aseptic conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) or to administer inhaled anesthetics or other gases.), in three of the studies a mouthpiece (Aid used for the administration or inhalation of a medicinal product by mouth.) was used with nose clips (a device intended to close a patient's external nares (nostrils) during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.) and in three studies it was unclear whether a mask (Devices that cover the nose and mouth to maintain aseptic conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) or to administer inhaled anesthetics or other gases.) or mouthpiece (Aid used for the administration or inhalation of a medicinal product by mouth.) was used. These studies compared PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) to ACBT (A type of psychotherapy utilized to treat different forms of mental disorders.The treatment involves the identification of unhelpful or destructive patterns of thinking and behaviors and the subsequent replacement with behaviors that are beneficial and constructive.), autogenic drainage (AD (A degenerative disease of the BRAIN characterized by the insidious onset of DEMENTIA.)), oral oscillating PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).)s, high-frequency chest wall oscillation (A respiratory support system that applies high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) for airway clearance by removing mucus to enhance pulmonary function.) (HFCWO) and BiPaP (A form of non-invasive mechanical pressure support ventilation that uses a time-cycled change of the applied positive airway pressure level to support spontaneous breathing activity.) and exercise. Forced expiratory volume in one second was the review's primary outcome and the most frequently reported outcome in the studies (24 studies, 716 participants). Single intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s or series of treatments (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.) that continued for up to three months demonstrated little or no difference in effect between PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) and other methods of airway clearance on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence). However, long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on this outcome (low- to moderate-quality evidence). A second primary outcome was the number of respiratory exacerbations. There was a lower exacerbation rate in participants using PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) compared to other techniques when used with a mask (Devices that cover the nose and mouth to maintain aseptic conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) or to administer inhaled anesthetics or other gases.) for at least one year (five studies, 232 participants; moderate- to high-quality evidence). In one of the included studies which used PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) with a mouthpiece (Aid used for the administration or inhalation of a medicinal product by mouth.), it was reported (personal communication) that there was no difference in the number of respiratory exacerbations (66 participants, low-quality evidence). Participant preference was reported in 10 studies; and in all studies with an intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) period of at least one month, this was in favour of PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.). The results for the remaining outcome measures (including our third primary outcome of mucus clearance) were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high-quality evidence; only very low- to moderate-quality evidence was available for other outcomes. There was limited evidence reported on adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.); these were measured in five studies, two of which found no events. In a study where infants performing either PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) or PDPV experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux (Retrograde flow of gastric juice (GASTRIC ACID) and/or duodenal contents (BILE ACIDS; PANCREATIC JUICE) into the distal ESOPHAGUS, commonly due to incompetence of the LOWER ESOPHAGEAL SPHINCTER.) , this was more severe in the PDPV group (26 infants, low-quality evidence). In PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) versus oscillating PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.), adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were only reported in the flutter group (five participants complained of dizziness (An imprecise term which may refer to a sense of spatial disorientation, motion of the environment, or lightheadedness.), which improved after further instructions on device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).) use was provided) (22 participants, low-quality evidence). In PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) versus HFCWO, from one long-term high-quality study (107 participants) there was little or no difference in terms of number of adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.); however, those in the PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) group had fewer adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) related to the lower airways when compared to HFCWO (high-certainty evidence). Many studies had a risk of bias as they did not report how the randomisation sequence was either generated or concealed. Most studies reported the number of dropouts and also reported on all planned outcome measures. The evidence provided by this review is of variable quality, but suggests that all techniques and device (useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).)s described may have a place in the clinical treatment (Actual observation and treatment of disease in patients (including experimental treatment) as distinct from theoretical or experimental work.) of people with CF. Following meta-analyses of the effects of PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) versus other airway clearance techniques on lung function and patient preference, this Cochrane Review demonstrated that there was high-quality evidence that showed a significant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations (An acute episode of worsening pulmonary symptoms related to cystic fibrosis.) when PEP (A monocarboxylic acid anion derived from selective deprotonation of the carboxy group of phosphoenolpyruvic acid.) using a mask (Devices that cover the nose and mouth to maintain aseptic conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) or to administer inhaled anesthetics or other gases.) was compared with HFCWO. It is important to note that airway clearance techniques should be individualised throughout life according to developmental stages, patient preferences, pulmonary symptoms and lung function. This also applies as conditions (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.) vary between baseline function and pulmonary exacerbations (An acute episode of worsening pulmonary symptoms related to cystic fibrosis.).",

                "The review includes 28 studies with 788 people (from infants to adults) with CF with mild to severe lung disease. The studies compared PEP to other methods of chest physiotherapy; the length of treatment ranged from a single session to two years of treatment. Generally, the efficacy of PEP is similar to other methods of chest physiotherapy such as postural drainage with percussion, active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, oscillatory PEP devices such as the flutter and acapella, thoracic oscillating devices such as the 'Vest', and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPaP) (typically used for ventilatory support, but by changing the inspiratory and expiratory pressures on the device and combining it with huffing, BiPaP has been used for airway clearance). We found no difference between PEP and other forms of chest physiotherapy in lung function, the amount of mucus cleared from the airways or its related effects on the health of people with CF. However, the rate of flare ups of respiratory symptoms decreased in people using PEP compared to other forms of physiotherapy such as a vibrating PEP device or a vibrating vest. There was some evidence that people with CF may prefer PEP to other chest physiotherapy methods. There was no evidence of PEP causing harm, except in one study where infants performing either PEP or percussion in various positions which use gravity to help drain secretions, experienced some gastro-oesophageal reflux (regurgitation of food) in head-down positions; this was more severe in the group using postural drainage with percussion. In all the other trials PEP was performed in a sitting position. In 10 of the 28 studies studied single PEP treatment sessions. The results from these studies are very limited as they could not report on the number of respiratory infections and lung function did not change with just one treatment. Two one-year studies compared PEP to postural drainage and percussion; in the study with children, PEP improved their lung function, while in the adult study, lung function declined slightly with both PEP and postural drainage and percussion. Also, the method of performing PEP was different in the two age groups. Although PEP seems to have an advantage in reducing flare ups (based on the combined results of a few studies), different physiotherapy techniques and devices may be more or less effective at varying times and in different individuals during baseline function and chest flare ups. Each person should talk to their clinician to help choose which method of airway clearance is best for them and which they will adhere to, so as to provide the best quality of life and long-term outcomes. Some studies were of low quality. These studies highlight the difficulty in comparing studies using PEP compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy. Factors such as age and severity of lung disease in the participants may affect the results as well as the method of performing each treatment. Overall, the evidence provided by this review for whether PEP reduces flare ups compared to other forms of chest physiotherapy was moderate to high quality, but evidence for other outcomes was of very low to moderate quality, as results were limited."

Study data for treatment outcomes in patients with heart failure (Inability of the heart to pump blood at an adequate rate to fill tissue metabolic requirements or the ability to do so only at an elevated filling pressure.) and CKD (Impairment of the renal function secondary to chronic kidney damage persisting for three or more months.) are sparse despite the potential impact of kidney impairment (Diminished kidney function.) on the benefits and harms (A form of RHABDOMYOSARCOMA occurring mainly in adolescents and young adults, affecting muscles of the extremities, trunk, orbital region, etc.) of treatment. Future research aimed at analysing existing data in general population HF studies to explore the effect in subgroups of patients with CKD (Impairment of the renal function secondary to chronic kidney damage persisting for three or more months.), considering stage of disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.), may yield valuable insights for the management of people with HF and CKD (Impairment of the renal function secondary to chronic kidney damage persisting for three or more months.).",

                "We found 31 studies involving 23,762 people with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Patients were given either a heart failure medicine compared to standard care or a placebo. The treatment they received was decided by random chance. Although there were many different treatments studied, unfortunately, few of them looked at the same type of medicine. As well, there were many different ways that researchers measured what happened when patients took these medicines. As a result, we could not combine the studies together and clarify the benefits and harms of each treatment. Existing studies cannot really tell us whether medicines used to treat heart failure in the general population are effective or safe for people who have both heart failure and chronic kidney disease. We are not able to recommend which heart failure medicines are best for people with heart failure and chronic kidney disease. We need more information from large clinical studies. Most of the heart failure studies did not report treatment effects separately based on levels of kidney function. Obtaining this information from existing studies may be helpful to learn more about how to treat heart failure in people with chronic kidney disease."

The neonatal outcome was not statistically different between groups: Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.83; three studies, n = 1945); umbilical artery pH less than 7.15 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.79; one study, n = 1456); umbilical artery pH less than 7.16 (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.92; one study, n = 239); admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.67; two studies, n = 489); and more than 48 hours hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.20; one study, n = 1456).

One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups whereas the second reported a reduction in symptoms in the exercise group. In one study, increases in change in ejection fraction (amount of blood pumped out of the left lower chamber of the heart with each heart beat) compared with baseline (mean difference (MD) 4.88%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.16 to 6.60; 30 participants; P < 0.00001), half venous refilling time (MD 4.20 seconds, 95% CI 3.28 to 5.12; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) and total venous refilling time (MD 9.40 seconds, 95% CI 7.77 to 11.03; 23 participants; P < 0.00001) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. One study reported no difference between the exercise and control groups with regard to quality of life or ankle range of motion.

Due to the small number of studies and small sample size, we were not able to verify indirectness and publication bias. Therefore, we judged the overall quality of evidence as very low according to the GRADE approach. There is currently insufficient evidence available to assess the efficacy of physical exercise in people with CVI (Visual impairment due to central nervous system dysfunction.). Future research into the effect of physical exercise should consider types of exercise protocols (intensity, frequency and time), sample size, blinding and homogeneity according to the severity of disease (A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.).",

At the end of the study, an improvement in venous blood return was observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. The included studies did not report on new cases of venous leg ulcers. No difference between the exercise and control groups was observed with regard to participants' quality of life, the range of motion of the ankle joint or overall muscle strength. The overall finding of an improvement in venous blood return in the exercise group favours the idea that physical exercise improves blood flow conditions in people with CVI, but we found the risk of bias due to blinding or randomisation to be high for both studies. We therefore consider that there is currently not enough information to determine whether physical exercise is effective in the management of CVI. Quality of the evidence We judged the overall quality of evidence as very low: the two included studies were small (54 participants in total) and were at high risk of bias based on their methods of blinding or randomisation."

Forty trials included comparisons of hyaluronan/hylan and placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.)

The pooled analyses of the effects of viscosupplements (Viscoelastic solutions that are injected into JOINTS in order to alleviate symptoms of joint-related disorders such as OSTEOA (A progressive, degenerative joint disease, the most common form of arthritis, especially in older persons.)RTHRITIS.) against 'placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.)' controls generally supported the efficacy of this class of intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). In these same analyses, differential efficacy effects were observed for different product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)s on different variables and at different timepoints. Of note is the 5 to 13 week post injection period which showed a percent improvement from baseline of 28 to 54% for pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) and 9 to 32% for function. In general, comparable efficacy was noted against NSAIDs (Anti-inflammatory agents that are non-steroidal in nature.) and longer-term benefits were noted in comparisons against IA corticosteroids (Hormones synthesized in the cortex of the adrenal gland and consist of two subclasses, glucocorticoids (carbohydrate regulation) and mineralocorticoids (electrolyte regulation).). In general, few adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.) were reported in the hyaluronan/hylan trials included in these analyses. Based on the aforementioned analyses, viscosupplementation (A therapeutic treatment typically involving INTRA-ARTICULAR INJECTIONS of HYALURONIC ACID and related compounds.) is an effective treatment for OA (A progressive, degenerative joint disease, the most common form of arthritis, especially in older persons.) of the knee (A region of the lower extremity immediately surrounding and including the KNEE JOINT.) with beneficial effects: on pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.), function and patient global assessment; and at different post injection periods but especially at the 5 to 13 week post injection period. It is of note that the magnitude of the clinical effect, as expressed by the WMD and standardised mean difference (SMD) from the RevMan 4.2 output, is different for different product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)s, comparisons, timepoints, variables and trial designs. However, there are few randomised head-to-head comparisons of different viscosupplements (Viscoelastic solutions that are injected into JOINTS in order to alleviate symptoms of joint-related disorders such as OSTEOA (A progressive, degenerative joint disease, the most common form of arthritis, especially in older persons.)RTHRITIS.) and readers should be cautious, therefore, in drawing conclusions regarding the relative value of different product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)s. The clinical effect for some product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)s, against placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.), on some variables at some timepoints is in the moderate to large effect-size range. Readers should refer to relevant tables to review specific detail given the heterogeneity in effects across the product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.) class and some discrepancies observed between the RevMan 4.2 analyses and the original publications. Overall, the analyses performed are positive for the HA (The symptom of PAIN in the cranial region.) class and particularly positive for some product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)s with respect to certain variables and timepoints, such as pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) on weight bearing at 5 to 13 weeks postinjection. In general, sample-size restrictions preclude any definitive comment on the safety of the HA (The symptom of PAIN in the cranial region.) class of product (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.)s; however, within the constraints of the trial designs employed no major safety issues were detected. In some analyses viscosupplements (Viscoelastic solutions that are injected into JOINTS in order to alleviate symptoms of joint-related disorders such as OSTEOA (A progressive, degenerative joint disease, the most common form of arthritis, especially in older persons.)RTHRITIS.) were comparable in efficacy to systemic forms of active intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.), with more local reactions (A regionally-limited response to an antigen, which may include inflammation, induration, erythema, pruritus or pain.) but fewer systemic adverse events (An unexpected medical problem that happens during treatment with a drug or other therapy.)

Adjunctive use (done as part of another dental procedure.) of misoprostol (A synthetic analog of natural prostaglandin E1.)

Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol (A synthetic analog of natural prostaglandin E1.) were more likely to have additional blood loss (Bleeding or escape of blood from a vessel.) of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75). Misoprostol (A synthetic analog of natural prostaglandin E1.) was associated with a significant increase in vomiting (The forcible expulsion of the contents of the STOMACH through the MOUTH.) and shivering. Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen (Compounds that interact with ESTROGEN RECEPTORS in target tissues to bring about the effects similar to those of ESTRADIOL.) and tranexamic acid (Antifibrinolytic hemostatic used in severe hemorrhage.), respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes. One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes. We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH (involved in glycolysis.) unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics. Clinical trials included in the current review were not adequately powered to assess impact on the primary outcome measures. Compared with misoprostol (A synthetic analog of natural prostaglandin E1.), oxytocin (A nonapeptide hormone released from the neurohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, POSTERIOR).) infusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) is more effective and causes fewer side effects when used as first-line therapy (The preferred standard treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment for a particular condition.) for the treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment of primary PPH (involved in glycolysis.). When used after prophylactic uterotonics, misoprostol (A synthetic analog of natural prostaglandin E1.) and oxytocin (A nonapeptide hormone released from the neurohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, POSTERIOR).) infusion (A method of putting fluids, including drugs, into the bloodstream.) worked similarly. The review suggests that among women who received oxytocin (A nonapeptide hormone released from the neurohypophysis (PITUITARY GLAND, POSTERIOR).) for the treat (Procedures concerned with the remedial treatment or prevention of diseases.)ment of primary PPH (involved in glycolysis.), adjunctive use (done as part of another dental procedure.) of misoprostol (A synthetic analog of natural prostaglandin E1.) confers no added benefit.

However, oxytocin needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and so in settings where refrigeration and infusions are not readily available, misoprostol can be used. Other clinical trials looked into using other types of drugs or squeezing the main artery that supplies blood to the woman.

                "We included 77 randomised clinical trials that involved a total of 6287 participants. Of these, 41 trials (3829 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes for this review. Thirty-five trials only included participants with NASH; five included only people with diabetes mellitus; and 14 included only people who did not have diabetes mellitus. The average follow-up period in the trials ranged from one month to two years in the trials that reported this information. We excluded trials in which participants with NAFLD had undergone liver transplantation before the trial. As well as conducting standard Cochrane analysis, we also planned to conduct network meta-analysis (a technique that enables comparison of different treatments that are not directly compared to each other in the trials). However, the nature of available information meant we could not determine if the network meta-analysis results were reliable. Specific outcomes we looked for were numbers of deaths, adverse events, and assessment of health-related quality of life. Twelve trials did not receive any additional funding or were funded by sources with no vested interest in the results; 26 were funded by drug companies that could potentially benefit from trial results; and the funding source was not available from 39 trials. Included trials compared drug treatments such as bile acids, antioxidants, phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, glucocorticosteroid inhibitor, anti-cholesterol drugs and anti-diabetes drugs with a fake treatment (placebo) or no treatment. There were no deaths in either group (87 participants, 1 trial). None of the participants developed serious adverse events in the trial which reported the percentage of people with serious adverse events (87 participants, 1 trial). There was no evidence of difference in the number of serious adverse events between antioxidants and no intervention (254 participants, 2 trials). There was no evidence of difference in deaths at maximal follow-up (659 participants, 4 trials), percentage of people with serious adverse events (404 participants, 3 trials), or the number of serious adverse events (404 participants, 3 trials) between bile acids and no intervention. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. There were no deaths in either group (74 participants, 1 trial). None of the participants developed serious adverse events in the two trials which reported the percentage of people with serious adverse events (194 participants, 2 trials). There was no evidence of difference in the number of serious adverse events between thiazolidinediones and no intervention (357 participants, 3 trials). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. We found no evidence of benefit from any of the compared interventions in people with fatty liver disease. There is significant uncertainty in this issue, and we need further high quality randomised clinical trials with sufficiently large group of participants. Evidence quality was very low overall, and there was a high risk of bias. This means there is a possibility of making conclusions that wrongly interpret benefits or harms of treatments because of the ways the studies were conducted."

At the median specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) was 75% (95% CI 67 to 85), the positive likelihood ratio was 2.72 (95% CI 2.43 to 3.04), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.32 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.47). Six studies (164 cases and 328 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau. The sensitivities were between 40% and 100% while the specificities were between 22% and 86%. At the median specificity of 47.5%, the estimated sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) was 81% (95% CI: 64 to 91), the positive likelihood ratio was 1.55 (CI 1.31 to 1.84), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.39 (CI: 0.19 to 0.82). Five studies (140 cases and 293 non-cases) evaluated the accuracy of the CSF p-tau/ABeta ratio. The sensitivities were between 80% and 96% while the specificities were between 33% and 95%. We did not conduct a meta-analysis because the studies were few and small. Only one study reported the accuracy of CSF t-tau/ABeta ratio. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting. A significant number of studies had unclear risk of bias for the reference standard, participant selection and flow and timing domains. According to the assessment of index test domain, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. The accuracy of these CSF biomarkers for \u2018other dementia (The presence of dementia in an individual younger than age sixty five.)s\u2019 had not been investigated in the included primary studies. Investigation of heterogeneity The main sources of heterogeneity were thought likely to be reference standards used for the target disorders, sources of recruitment, participant sampling (the selection and implementation of statistical observations in order to estimate properties of an underlying population; also, in environmental science, the collection of representative specimens analyzed to characterize site conditions.), index test methodology and aspects of study quality (particularly, inadequate blinding). We were not able to formally assess the effect of each potential source of heterogeneity as planned, due to the small number of studies available to be included. The insufficiency and heterogeneity of research to date primarily leads to a state of uncertainty regarding the value of CSF testing of t-tau, p-tau or p-tau/ABeta ratio for the diagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of Alzheimer's disease (A degenerative disease of the BRAIN characterized by the insidious onset of DEMENTIA.) in current clinical practice. Particular attention should be paid to the risk of misdiagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) and overdiagnosis (The determination of the nature of a disease or condition, or the distinguishing of one disease or condition from another.) of dementia (The presence of dementia in an individual younger than age sixty five.) (and therefore over-treatment) in clinical practice. These tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.), like other biomarker tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) which have been subject to Cochrane DTA reviews, appear to have better sensitivity (Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.) than specificity and therefore might have greater utility in ruling out Alzheimer's disease (A degenerative disease of the BRAIN characterized by the insidious onset of DEMENTIA.) as the aetiology to the individual's evident cognitive impairment (Interference or disruption of cognitive processes.), as opposed to ruling it in. The heterogeneity observed in the few studies awaiting classification suggests our initial summary will remain valid. However, these tests (Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.) may have limited clinical value until uncertainties have been addressed. Future studies with more uniformed approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogenous estimate than the one that has been available from the included studies we have identified.",

                "The evidence is current to January 2013. We included 15 studies containing a total of 1282 participants with MCI. The majority of studies (n = 9) were published between 2010 and 2013. The remaining six studies were published between 2004 and 2009. All of the included studies were conducted in Europe. Study sizes varied and ranged from 15 to 231 participants.The mean (range) age of the youngest sample was 64 years (45 to 76) and the mean (standard deviation) age of the oldest sample was 73.4 (6.6) years. Our findings are based on studies with poor reporting, with a majority of studies at unclear risk of bias due to insufficient details given on how participants were selected and how the clinical diagnosis of dementia was established. According to the assessment of how the CSF tests were conducted and analysed, eight of 15 studies were of poor methodological quality. Below is a summary of key findings for the tests: CSF t-tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia The sensitivity values in seven individual studies ranged from 51% to 90% while the specificity values ranged from 48% to 88%. The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 72%, the estimated sensitivity was 77%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 62% and the negative predictive value was 84%. Based on these results, on average 62 out of 100 people with MCI and a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia but 38 would not; on average, 84 out of 100 people with MCI and with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 16 would. CSF p-tau test for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia The sensitivity values in six individual studies ranged from 40% to 100% while the specificity values ranged from 22% to 86%. The statistical analysis of those studies showed that, at the fixed specificity of 48%, the estimated sensitivity was 81%, and, at the prevalence of 37%, the positive predictive value was 48% and the negative predictive value was 81%. Based on these results, on average 48 out of 100 people with MCI and with a positive index test result would convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 52 would not; on average, 81 out of 100 people with MCI with a negative index test result would not convert to Alzheimer's disease dementia, but 19 would. We found that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostic test, as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who would develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia or other forms of dementia over a period of time. The data suggested that a negative CSF test, in people with MCI, almost indicates the absence of Alzheimer's disease as the cause of their clinical symptoms. However, a positive CSF test does not confirm the presence of Alzheimer's disease as the aetiology (cause) of their clinical symptoms. There were methodological problems in the included studies that did not allow for a clear answer to the review question. The main limitations of the review were poor reporting in the included studies, lack of a widely accepted threshold of the CSF diagnostic tests in people with MCI, variability in length of follow-up, and the marked variation in CSF tests\u2019 accuracy between the included studies."

The men were between 50 and 75 years of age and met criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification scores (ASA) I, ll and III.

No studies addressed the secondary outcomes of adverse effects, all-cause mortality, respiratory or circulatory complications (In medicine, a medical problem that occurs during a disease, or after a procedure or treatment.), cognitive dysfunction (Interference or disruption of cognitive processes.), length of stay or costs. Overall the quality of evidence was low to very low, as all studies were small, single-centre trials providing unclear descriptions of methods. It is unclear which anaesthetic technique (A blocking of nerve conduction to a specific area by an injection of an anesthetic agent.) is superior - TIVA or inhalational - for transabdominal robotic assisted surgery (developed on the technique of endoscopic surgery where surgical tools are inserted into the patient through ports that are connected to robotic arms which are controlled by the surgeon.) in urology, gynaecology and gastroenterology, as existing evidence is scarce, is of low quality and has been generated from exclusively male patients undergoing robotic radical prostatectomy (Surgery to remove the entire prostate.).

We looked for differences in pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and changes in pressure inside the eyes between patients receiving anaesthetic via the veins or by inhalation. Study funding sources Studies were funded by the institution, or the funding sources were not stated. Key results Postoperative pain was no different between the two types of anaesthesia. Anaesthesia delivered through the veins reduced PONV at one to six hours after prostate surgery compared with anaesthesia provided via inhalation. One study showed that anaesthesia delivered through the veins prevented an increase in pressure inside the eyes during surgery compared with inhalational anaesthesia. We cannot conclude whether this means that anaesthesia provided via the veins reduces ocular complications, as no patients in this small study developed these complications. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was considered low, as included studies were small and provided an unclear description of methods. All participants in these studies were men who were undergoing robotic assisted laparoscopic removal of the prostate.

                "We updated the review that was previously published in 2009. We examined the research published up to July 2015 and found seven new studies. All in all, this updated review included a total of 14 observational studies that assessed 1,601,515 pregnancies. Observational studies are generally regarded as less rigorous than randomised controlled clinical trials. The funding source was from academic or governmental institutions in 10 studies and was not reported in 4 studies. We found no associations between mothers' use of topical steroids of any potency and type of delivery, birth defects, premature births, or low Apgar score. There is some evidence indicating a relation between low birth weight and maternal use of potent or very potent topical steroids, especially when high doses are used in pregnancy, and this may warrant more research. On the other hand, maternal use of mild or moderate topical corticosteroids is not related to low birth weight. We even found that mild or moderately potent topical steroids protect against death of the baby, but this was not seen when the mothers used potent or very potent topical steroids. This finding needs further examination. The overall quality of evidence is low because all available studies were observational. The high quality study design of the randomised controlled trial that allocates participants to receive either topical corticosteroids or no treatment is not generally feasible in pregnant women due to ethical concerns about possible exposure of the foetus to an experimental treatment. Where we further downgraded the quality of the evidence to 'very low', it was because we had detected variation in the results from the studies that we found, which means that we have low confidence in our estimates of the effects for our outcomes."

The three smaller studies followed participants for two to three months. The evidence is current to July 2014. None of the four studies reported an important difference between topical corticosteroid therapy and placebo or control treatment for reduction in ulcer size, change in visual acuity, adverse events, or quality of life. One study reported that healing or cure time in the steroid group was slower than the placebo group (for every 100 people cured in the control group, only 47 were cured in the steroid group during the same time period), but the largest study did not report any difference (for every 100 people cured in the control group, 92 were cured in the steroid group during the same time interval). For adverse events, none of the studies found a difference between the two groups, except that one study reported that more eyes in the control group developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. We did not find any information on economic outcomes. Generally, the quality of the evidence based on the four studies we identified was moderate due to the proportions of participants who were not included in the final study analyses and the inconsistency of outcomes assessed across the four studies. In addition, three studies enrolled too few participants (30 to 42) to reach scientifically valid conclusions."

Only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) was included in this review. In addition, a large proportion of families in the non-intervention group secured day care services for themselves. The quality of the evidence included in this review is very low, so the results must be interpreted with caution. Although RCTs do not allow conclusive judgements as regards the role of centre-based day care in the development of children and the economic situation of parents, this does not imply that these services are not important in high-income countries. The need for effectiveness studies of centre-based day care without co-interventions is significant.

Evidence from one trial (85 participants) showed no clinically important difference in pain (An unpleasant sensation induced by noxious stimuli which are detected by NERVE ENDINGS of NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS.) between the two groups. Overall, there is either no or insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the use of surgery or the best surgical intervention for distal tibial metaphyseal fractures in adults.

Because so few people die of asthma, huge trials or observational studies are normally required to detect a difference in death rates from asthma. There were more non-fatal serious adverse events in people taking salmeterol compared to those on placebo; for every 188 people treated with salmeterol for 28 weeks, one extra non-fatal event occurred in comparison with placebo. There was no significant differences in serious adverse events in people on salmeterol compared to regular salbutamol. In order to obtain individual patient data on asthma deaths, we looked separately at mortality in two large trials on over 51,000 patients who were not taking inhaled corticosteroids, and found that there was an increase in the number of asthma-related deaths among people on salmeterol. We conclude that, for patients whose asthma is not well-controlled on moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids, additional salmeterol can improve symptoms but this may be at the expense of an increased risk of serious adverse events and asthma related mortality.\u00a0Salmeterol should not be used as a substitute for inhaled corticosteroids, and adherence with inhaled steroids should be kept under review if separate inhalers are used. Salmeterol should not be taken by people who are not taking regular inhaled steroids due to the increased risk of asthma-related death."

Bisphosphonates were given at around the time of kidney transplantation (generally just before or within a few weeks) and continued for about one year on average. Other treatment options in the studies were vitamin D, calcitonin, denosumab, teriparatide, or cinacalcet. Bisphosphonate treatment given after a transplant possibly prevents fractures and bone pain, however the range where the actual effect of treatment might be (the \"margin of error\") indicates that treatment might make little or no difference. Bisphosphonates possibly lower the chances of a rejection of the transplant kidney but because of problems with the research studies, we can't be very certain that this is true. Bisphosphonates caused low blood calcium levels for some people. There was low or very low confidence in the information about all the other possible treatments for bone fractures after a kidney transplant, as the studies were often too small. There was only one study for medicines in children so we don't know whether these drugs are useful and safe for younger people.

We found that D2 lymphadenectomy can reduce the number of deaths due to disease progression as compared to D1 lymphadenectomy. However, D2 lymphadenectomy was also associated with a higher rate of postoperative mortality. In addition, available evidence does not support the superiority of D3 versus D2 lymphadenectomy. In conclusion, our findings support the use of D2 lymphadenectomy in patients with resectable carcinoma of the stomach, although the increased incidence of postoperative mortality reduces its therapeutic effect. The quality of the evidence was moderate due to an intermediate level of result heterogeneity across the included trials."

The only outcome statistically significant in favour of naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) is re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84), but results come only from two studies. Considering only studies were patients were forced to adherence a statistical significant difference in favour of naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) was found for retention and abstinence, RR 2.93 (95%CI 1.66-5.18). Comparing naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) versus psychotherapy (A generic term for the treatment of mental illness or emotional disturbances primarily by verbal or nonverbal communication.), in the two considered outcomes, no statistically significant difference was found in the single study considered. Naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) was not superior to benzodiazepine (A group of two-ring heterocyclic compounds consisting of a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring.)s and to buprenorphine (a more potent and longer lasting analgesic than MORPHINE.) for retention and abstinence and side effects. Results come from single studies. The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) did not perform better than treatment with placebo (Any dummy medication or treatment.) or no pharmacological agent (used to prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease or abnormal condition.) with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.)

The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) treatment in the field of opioid (A substance used to treat moderate to severe pain.) dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy (given to help keep cancer from coming back after it has disappeared following the initial therapy.) with naltrexone (the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of NALOXONE.) cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.",

The only outcome that was clearly in favour of naltrexone was a reduction of re incarcerations by about a half but these results were from only two studies. In single studies naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines or buprenorphine for retention, abstinence or side effects. The review authors identified a total of 13 randomised controlled studies that involved 1158 opioid addicts treated as outpatients following detoxification. Less than a third of participants were retained in treatment over the duration of the included studies. The mean duration was six months (range one to 10 months).

The sequence of intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.)s during videofluoroscopy may have influenced response to intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.). The second study, a parallel designed RCT, compared the effect of nectar (Sugar-rich liquid produced in plant glands called nectaries.) and honey thick liquids with a chin down head posture over a three-month period in a subgroup of 260 participants with dementia (The presence of dementia in an individual younger than age sixty five.). Outcomes were pneumonia (Infection of the lung often accompanied by inflammation.) and adverse intervention (In medicine, a treatment or action taken to prevent or treat disease, or improve health in other ways.) effects. Honey thick liquids, which are more consistent with descriptors for 'spoon thick' or 'extremely thick' liquids, showed a more positive impact on immediate elimination of aspiration (Procedure using suction, usually with a thin needle and syringe, to remove bodily fluid or tissue.) during videofluoroscopy, but this consistency showed more adverse effects in the second follow-up study. During the second three-month follow-up trial, there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia (Infection of the lung often accompanied by inflammation.) in participants receiving honey thick liquids than those receiving nectar (Sugar-rich liquid produced in plant glands called nectaries.) thick liquids or taking regular liquids with a chin down posture.

We included data on people with dementia only. The first of the two studies looked at the immediate effects of two viscosities of liquids compared to regular thin liquids on aspiration (entry of food or fluid into the lungs) in 351 people with dementia. This study also compared drinking regular thin liquids using a chin down head posture as well as drinking regular thin liquids without any changes to head position; the main outcome was fluid entering the lungs. Using a subgroup of 260 people with dementia from the first study, the second study compared the effect of the same liquid viscosities with a chin down head posture. The effectiveness of these interventions on the incidence of pneumonia and adverse effects of these interventions was examined over a three-month period. Honey thick viscosity liquids, which clinically are similar to descriptions of 'very thick liquids', had a more positive immediate impact on preventing fluid entering the lungs when examined during videofluoroscopy (specialised swallow x-ray) examination. However, during the three-month follow-up period there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in the group of people with dementia receiving these honey thick liquids, than those receiving nectar thick liquids and those receiving regular thin liquids with a chin down posture. There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of liquids that the person with dementia was receiving. There were a number of methodological flaws in both studies in this review and these were acknowledged by the authors. While thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallow function, clinicians should consider the effects of this intervention on the person with dementia in the longer-term. People with dementia on thickened fluids require long-term follow-up. The overall risk of bias of included studies is high. The quality of evidence is low. Further well-designed research is needed."

The risk of bias present in many studies was unclear due to poor reporting. Thus, while there are a large number of randomised controlled trials, the evidence remains mostly low quality when rated using the GRADE system.
