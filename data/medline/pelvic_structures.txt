What is a Cesarean section (C-section)?A Cesarean section (C-section) is surgery to deliver a baby. The baby is taken out through your abdomen (belly). In the United States, almost one in three babies are born this way. Some C-sections are planned. Others are emergency C-sections, which are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery.When is a Cesarean section (C-section) needed?You may need a C-section because:You have health problems, including infectionYou are carrying more than one babyYour baby is too bigYour baby is in the wrong positionYour baby's health is in dangerLabor is not moving along as it shouldThere are problems with your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to your baby)Not everyone who has had a C-section before will need another one next time. You may be able to have a vaginal birth after Cesarean (VBAC). Talk to your health care provider about what is right for you.How is a Cesarean section (C-section) done?Before the surgery, you will be given pain medicine. Depending on your circumstances, you might get:An epidural block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine.A spinal block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection directly into the spinal fluid.General anesthesia, which makes you unconscious during the surgery. This is often used during emergency C-sections.During the surgery, the surgeon will:Make a cut in your abdomen and uterus. The cut is usually horizontal, but in some cases it may be vertical.Open the amniotic sac and take out your baby.Cut the umbilical cord and the placenta.Close the uterus and abdomen with stitches that will later dissolve.What are the risks of a Cesarean section (C-section)?A C-section is relatively safe for you and your baby. But it is still a major surgery, and it carries risks. They may include:InfectionBlood lossBlood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungsInjury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladderA reaction to the medicines or anesthesia usedSome of these risks do also apply to a vaginal birth. But it does take longer to recover from a C-section than from a vaginal birth. And a C-section can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies. The more C-sections you have, the more the risk goes up. NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
