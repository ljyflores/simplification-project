What is lupus?Lupus is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.There are several kinds of lupus:Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body.Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go awaySubacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sunDrug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.What causes lupus?The cause of lupus is unknown.Who is at risk for lupus?Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in white women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.What are the symptoms of lupus?Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person.

For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working.
