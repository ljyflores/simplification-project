Some eye problems are minor and don't last long. But some can lead to a permanent loss of vision.Common eye problems include:Refractive errorsCataracts - clouded lensesOptic nerve disorders, including glaucomaRetinal disorders - problems with the nerve layer at the back of the eyeMacular degeneration - a disease that destroys sharp, central visionDiabetic eye problemsConjunctivitis - an  infection also known as pink eyeYour best defense is to have regular checkups, because eye diseases do not always have symptoms. Early detection and treatment could prevent vision loss. See an eye care professional right away if you have a sudden change in vision, if everything looks dim, or if you see flashes of light. Other symptoms that need quick attention are pain, double vision, fluid coming from the eye, and inflammation.NIH: National Eye Institute
