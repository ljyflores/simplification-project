Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets.  Vitamin D also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and immune systems.You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. However, too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer.  So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.Vitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver.  Some other foods, like milk and cereal, often have added vitamin D. You can also take vitamin D supplements.  Check with your health care provider to see how much you should take.  People who might need extra vitamin D include:Older adultsBreastfed infantsPeople with dark skinPeople with  certain conditions, such as liver diseases, cystic fibrosis and Crohn's diseasePeople who have obesity or have had gastric bypass surgeryNIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements
