The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. Women have two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus.  Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond.The ovaries produce and store a woman's eggs. During ovulation, an ovary releases an egg. If that egg is fertilized by a sperm, a pregnancy can occur. Ovaries also make the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. When a woman goes through menopause, her ovaries stop making those hormones and releasing eggs.Problems with the ovaries include:Ovarian cancerOvarian cysts and polycystic ovary syndromePrimary ovarian insufficiencyOvarian torsion, a twisting of the ovary
