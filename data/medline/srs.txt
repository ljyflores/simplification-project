The radiation may be external, from special machines, or internal, from radioactive substances that a doctor places inside your body. The type of radiation therapy you receive depends on many factors, including:The type of cancerThe size of the cancerThe cancer's location in the bodyHow close the cancer is to normal tissues that are sensitive to radiationHow far into the body the radiation needs to travelYour general health and medical historyWhether you will have other types of cancer treatmentOther factors, such as your age and other medical conditionsRadiation therapy can damage normal cells as well as cancer cells.
