A 7 mm enhancing soft tissue nodule in the right lateral chest wall (image 335 of series 5) is suspected to reflect an additional lymph node as well. There are subcentimeter right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. There is a tubular low-density lesion involving the left superior/posterior mediastinum extending from the thoracic inlet to T4, located lateral to the esophagus and medial to the aortic arch measuring approximately 2.7 x 1.2 cm on coronal reformatted image 32 of series 605. This is better evaluated on same-day spine MRI and was apparently non-enhancing, therefore likely reflects an incidental lymphangioma or lymphocele of the thoracic duct. Residual thymic tissue is within normal limits for patient's age. Status post thyroidectomy. Heart and Vessels: The heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Incidental note made of an aberrant right subclavian artery arising from a diverticulum of Kommerell. Upper Abdomen: Concurrent CT abdomen/pelvis is dictated separately. Osseous structures and Soft Tissues: Multiple blastic bone metastases are present including involving the spine, sternum, right humeral head, and right scapula. An obliquely oriented pectus deformity is incidentally noted.",
